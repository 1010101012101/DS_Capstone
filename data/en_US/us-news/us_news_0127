After years of working on and off throughout most weekends, I was trying a new approach by taking off at least one entire day every weekend this month, away from reporting, writing and all other work. Early on, I hated it. As simple as it seemed, sticking to a time-off plan stressed me out at first. What I didn't see right away was that my little test was forcing me to improve the way I work.
In all my travels throughout this incredible nation of ours - 37 states and over 200 cities - I have never met liberal ones who embraced the laudability of the Petronius Tower Platform in the Gulf of Mexico; marvel at the technology of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station near the San Clemente shores; assimilate the beauty of flowing oil through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline; bask in the glory of the Cherokee coal-fired power plant in Colorado nor shed tears of joy at the magnificence and magnitude of the natural gas producing Barnett Shale in Texas.
Frequently changing work by local artists is displayed throughout the building, which is at once elegant and relaxed. While the adjacent fine dining restaurant Etoile has a dress code, anything goes on the patio and in the tasting room. Weather permitting, the floor-to-ceiling windows behind the long tasting counter slide out of sight, intimately connecting the barrel-roofed room to the woodsy landscape.
Appearing on ESPN Radio's "Mike and Mike in the Morning," Umenyiora said a trade to another team — one that would presumably give him a new, big contract — isn't out of the question.

As Tom grows ever more resentful of Violet's success (and her friendship with the obligatory pompous professor/faculty adviser, hilariously played by Rhys Ifans), their grandparents start dying off one by one, without ever having witnessed the wedding that keeps getting put on hold. Even Violet's anti-marriage, anti-child sister (a brilliant Alison Brie) has found wedded bliss and has started a family with Tom's best friend, Alex (Chris Pratt, doing a terrific variation on the irresistible moron character he plays to perfection on "Parks and Recreation"). As is the case with virtually every romantic comedy, there's a cast of supporting players whose primary reason for being is to observe and quip wise about the main romance. (The standout is Mindy Kaling, who deserves her own starring vehicle.)
Bass had to start by getting a bachelor's degree. He went to the University of California, Irvine, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude before going to UCLA law school, where he was editor of the UCLA Law Review. His law career began in 1992, and flourished.

The high tolls in the metropolitan area have forced trucking companies to route drivers along congested free roads, make deliveries very early in the morning or stop bidding on jobs for which they’d have to use expensive bridges and highways. Some companies have even moved their fleets into Pennsylvania, where they can travel along the border on the cheap before entering the state along Interstates 78 or 80.
It was not the first or last song about the sinking — and in fact, one of the enduring story lines of the Titanic is about music. The band on Titanic did play as the ship went down. Experts disagree on the song, but they agree that there was a soundtrack to the disaster.

Nowadays, evangelists like Ellenbogen seem to be winning the fight. By purposely omitting the obvious, wine lists in Bay Area restaurants are arguably more innovative and diverse - and perhaps more radical - than ever. A combination of small local importers and an increasingly eclectic roster of local wine has made this a more interesting place to drink wine than most cities around the world.
Prosecutors had a theory, however.

Director Andrew Stanton, director of the Pixar hits Finding Nemo and Wall-E (and working in live-action for the first time), has found an aptly named leading man. John Carter is about as kitsch as you can get, although Kitsch manages to keep his scowl in place as a planeload of British thespians, decked out in armor and plumage, offer mock-Shakespearean pronouncements of animus and portent. For the record, the Brits (and Irish) involved in this epically cheesy fantasy include Mark Strong (a power-mad priest named Matai Shang), Dominic West (the Prince of Zodanga), Ciarán Hinds (as Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium), and James Purefoy (worried captain of a flying gunship).

For kids who don't yet know what type of books interest them, libraries offer summer reading programs and book clubs to jump-start a love of reading.

Once again, he turns to Islamic law, pointing to "tatarrus" — literally "shielding" — a set of Shariah rules on when civilian casualties are acceptable during jihad. The branches are playing too loosely with the rules, he says: They expand what should be an exception allowed "only in extreme necessity" and set off bombs without regard whether Muslim bystanders are likely to die.
"A mother is the most important role model in a person’s life," he said. "For these kids to have a mother figure like Mary is truly amazing."
With the economy in complete freefall, there werent any private companies or investors willing to take a chance on the auto industry. Anyone in the financial sector could tell you that. So we could have kept giving billions of taxpayer dollars to the automakers without demanding real change or accountability in return. But that wouldnt have solved anything. It would have just kicked the problem further on down the road. The other option we had was to do nothing, and allow these companies to fail. In fact, some politicians said we should. Some even said we should let Detroit go bankrupt.
Meat producers respond that there is not enough evidence to definitively link human antibacterial-resistant infection to animal use.

Katz seeks lost wages and compensatory and punitive damages.
Cashner was towing his bass boat. He doesn't go places for long periods of time without it, and given the winds and mountain passes he had to navigate, the outdoorsman gladly settled for taking in the beauty that is his new backyard. So going the 82-83 mph the same cop clocked Black and Roberts - about 18 mph slower than Cashner can throw a fastball, 7 less than his change-up - not only didn't make sense, but it would have taken some doing, and it might have been dangerous.
Airspace restrictions will also be in place, but the Secret Service release did not detail what those would be. Boaters on Lake Michigan will also face restrictions several days before and just after the summit as the Coast Guard increases its presence on the waterways.

It's called anthropomorphism, attributing human characteristics to animals. Penney saw plenty, most of it not harmful, during her estimated 51 years. The 8,000-pound African elephant was euthanized this week at the Kansas City Zoo. She'd grown arthritic, unable to eat.

Doug and Holly have requested to be considered for the Olympics, since Rolex is a selection trial for this summer's London Games, though there is a line of people ahead of them from the high performance training list. The only ones in the "A" category, however, are Boyd Martin and his mentor, Phillip Dutton, along with Sinead Halpin of Pittstown. But doing well at Rolex can suddenly put you on the map, as Halpin knows. She finished third in her Kentucky debut last year as the highest-placed American, and this year, team selectors decided she doesn't even have to compete at Rolex. Halpin and her horse, Manoir de Carneville, instead will be the "guinea pig" combo for the dressage phase, performing the test so judges can check themselves and make sure they're on the same page before the segment officially begins.

Plus, we don't know how Thomas and Carson will respond to being asked to do more minus the security blanket of knowing James is the man. It's one thing to get a few touches here and there in benign situations crafted by the coaching staff and knowing you're not being relied upon to be a key cog in a victory. It's another to be in the bright lights of a game in doubt, against a formidable defense knowing your replacing James.

The frequency of this changes from infancy to adulthood, with more than 50 percent of infants refluxing during a 24-hour period and only 10 percent of adults doing the same. The reason for this is the immaturity of the sphincter that separates the stomach from the esophagus. Even when stomach contents make their way into the esophagus, there are mechanisms in place to squeeze these contents back into the stomach rapidly. When we have overwhelming amounts of stomach contents or improper clearance mechanisms, the result is gastro-esophageal reflux disease.

Palmer, former lead Dresden Doll and “punk cabaret” progenitor, possesses one of the most unusual vocal styles in contemporary pop: It always sounds as if she isn’t sure whether to sing or make fun of singing. Since she ditched the Dolls, the problem has only gotten worse, reaching its nadir on a 2010 EP of maybe-I’m-joking ukulele Radiohead covers. “Who Killed Amanda Palmer?”, her 2008 solo debut, was a bizarre stab at the Top 40 powered by the blue humor that has always been her stock in trade. “Amanda Palmer Goes Down Under,” her latest, is a (mostly) live set recorded at a raucous club show in Sydney with loads of banter and shticky but often very funny rhymes about antipodean subjects. To be more precise, they’re about how antipodean subjects relate to Palmer: This is a woman who looks at a “Map of Tasmania” and thinks about a part of her anatomy. It’s all very amusing and will reinforce her rep as an irreverent bomb-chucker from pop’s periphery. But it’s telling that her best performance is the one on which she’s reunited with her old Dresden Dolls drummer.

The Conference Board says Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index is at 61.1, down from a revised 64.8 in December. The fall comes after the index had surged by more than 20 points last month from 40.9 in October amid growing signs of an improving economy. A reading of 90 indicates a healthy economy, a level it hasn't approached since the recession began in 2007.
But between then and now, Maryland replaced offensive coordinator Gary Crowton with Washington native and ace recruiter Mike Locksley, and the Terps suddenly found themselves right back in the mix for Brown.

The first scientific study of suicide was published in 1897 by French sociologist Emile Durkheim. He was convinced that growing suicide rates could not be attributed to mental illness alone. Though suicide is an individual act, Durkheim believed that its causes were social. One thing many suicides shared, he found, was geographic mobility. People had begun moving farther from home in the latter half of the 19th century, in pursuit of education, work and a better life.

Prosecutors portrayed Mandell and a co-defendant who awaits sentencing as con men, saying they capitalized on the excitement over Internet tech stocks by using their broker-dealer operation to solicit private investments in startups. Prosecutors said the defendants spent some of investor money living lavishly with private jets, expensive vacations, fancy cars and flashy watches. They said the men manipulated the value of stocks they sold to investors in part by paying brokers 400 percent commissions to promote the stocks.
Its last furnace closed in 1997.

The case at hand deals with an Eastern Shore man, Alonzo Jay King Jr. When law enforcement officials analyzed a DNA sample taken from him after his 2009 arrest on assault charges (but before he was convicted of that crime), they found a match to a sample taken in an unsolved 2003 rape case. Based on that evidence, Mr. King was convicted of the rape, but he appealed, claiming that the DNA sample was taken unlawfully.

Ovarian cancer is especially challenging to treat, as it is often not detected until it has spread. The cancer antigen 125 blood test, which can detect elevated levels of CA-125 -- a trait often found in women with ovarian cancer -- is not recommended as a screening test in women with an average risk of the disease because elevated levels can signal many other conditions.
Most turnpike customers like most drivers in Ohio pay a higher price for license plates and driver's licenses to pay for the highway patrol. Unfortunately the turnpike is excluded from that funding, so turnpike toll revenue is effectively $13 million higher (3) to cover the cost of the highway patrol assigned to the turnpike, including its facilities and staff. (And, by the way, fines collected go to the local communities along the turnpike.)
With a little help from the Missouri Department of Conservation and the local chapter of the National Audubon Society and Gateway Off-Road Cyclists, here are some of my favorite trails in the St. Louis area.
Josephine Cochrane, who devised the modern dishwasher in the late 1800s (she was a plucky woman of leisure whose grandfather had demonstrated the first functional steamboat in America), would probably be shocked at the conflicts her innovation has spawned.

With a city hearing officer's decision Thursday affirming the denial of a march stepping off from Daley Plaza, protesters have to decide whether to take their fight to Cook County Circuit Court.

Now, the Black Rep offers its adaptation with company founder Ron Himes starring as Norman Thayer, a cantankerous man who is struggling with old age and his resentful daughter.
If not exactly as overhyped as the '05 Bordeaux, the 2005s from Burgundy still got plenty of attention, so bargain hunting may be futile. That said, you can still find plenty on the better side of the price-quality equation. Because the vintage was so spectacular, village level and premier cru bottles are often performing well beyond their usual cred. Consider the 2005 Nicolas Rossignol Volnay 1er Cru Chevret ($70, Paul Marcus Wines, Oakland, winex.com or Vin, Vino, Wine, Palo Alto), from a fifth-generation grower and a plot on Volnay's border with Meursault. Fight the temptation to uncork it right away.
Point guard Jonny Flynn had another encouraging outing, zipping around the court for five points and three assists in 16 minutes, one of the assists a nice blind lob that center Hasheem Thabeet -- another newcomer -- dunked. And Luke Babbitt, the former first round pick who hasn't played much in his first two seasons in Portland, followed up his career-high 16-point performance on Thursday with two three-pointers on the way to eight points and three rebounds.
The margin for error grows smaller in Pac-10 play.
"Wilson" is the first book Clowes has assembled from all-new material and not from serialized comics. It's also his book most influenced by "Peanuts," including the way each page comprises its own strip.

NASA is trying to remain flexible on where it wants to go with SLS and when. The space agency is aiming for a nearby asteroid around 2025 and then on to Mars in the 2030s. There could even be a short hop to the moon, but not as a main goal. All those targets require lots of brute force to escape Earth's orbit, something astronauts have not done since 1972.
The video of that particular play indicates Brown is exaggerating - the Iowa State tackle flies no further than the sixth row of the bleachers - but it is a testament to Reyes' athleticism and aggressiveness. He looks like a player who would not be out of place dropping into coverage or catching patches - like a bear with a talent for the tango.
BMW has been striving to reconcile its dueling images for years. Best known for its luxurious, sport-oriented cars, the German manufacturer's motorcycles are only beginning to shed their reputation as wheels for safety-conscious old men, thanks to exciting new bikes like the S 1000 RR and K 1600 LT.

“This pushes for more high-stakes plays,” Romer told the New York Times. “The football analytics push you to a more aggressive, exciting game.”
The ripples from his decision started immediately: It meant the Republican governor, after weeks in the national glare, will now focus on New Jersey issues, where education reform tops his list. It also meant that the holiday is over for state Democrats who have not had to deal with him while he was on the campaign trail, pondering his future.
“Maybe we will ask people to shop there anytime during that month,” she said.

Favorite subject: English. "Given that talking is one of the first skills a person learns, it seems to be more naturally integrated into daily life than any other subject; communication is essential. Additionally, my English teacher is fantastic and makes the class as interesting as possible.
Caro is properly enthralled by Johnson putting the power of the presidency behind a discharge petition that, by advancing, compelled a Southern committee chairman to allow what became the 1964 Civil Rights Act to get to the Senate, where Johnson's meticulous cultivation of another Southern chairman prevented tax-cut legislation from becoming hostage to the civil-rights filibuster.

Brown tapped his head as a figurative knock-on-wood gesture in hopes the Lakers' relative health stays intact in the postseason. Bynum only missed a game because of a sprained left ankle, while Matt Barnes sat out the season finale because of a sprained right ankle. Steve Blake missed 13 games from January to early February because of a rib-sternum injury. And Bryant sat out for seven games to rest a sore left shin.
The budget is traditionally released on the first Monday in February -- which is Feb. 6 -- but the administration has pushed the release to Feb. 13. An administration official said the later date was "determined based on the need to finalize decisions and technical details of the document."
"Bandstand" wasn't a concert show, nor was it intended for the hardcore pop fans or the musical purists. With few exceptions - such as the time Jim Croce insisted on playing and singing "Operator" live - whether it was Jerry Lee Lewis or Stevie Wonder or Run DMC, the acts featured on the show lip-synched their hits. The music would fade out, and the band would stop pretending to play their instruments, and the crowd would applaud. It was all about the dancing couples, the suspense of the countdown, the moment when we learned the No. 1 song in America. Mr. Clark sitting in the stands with the teenagers. Wearing his coat and tie, looking like the cool teacher who "gets" the kids but isn't trying to be one of them.

I find it interesting that shortly after Alabama won the National Championship on Monday night, there were already sports media folks unveiling their top 10 for 2012. Nick Saban had barely lifted the trophy and already LSU was the preseason No. 1 again. Then again, at least these futurists -- first to predict the story! -- waited until the game was over. Critics of the Hall of Fame vote set land-speed records by pre-kvetching -- posting blogs, articles and Twitter takes that took writers to task before the vote was released.

It is easy to put something in the basement, storage room or closet, thinking you might need it someday. Maybe your closets are full of clothes you eventually will diet your way back into. Chances are that when you move, you will go through your belongings and get rid of some. You will make your home more attractive to potential buyers if you clean out and make it presentable before you list it for sale. In today's market, potential buyers have a lot of homes to choose from. In any market, but particularly when there are lots of homes to choose from, you can't rely on buyers to have an imagination. They might not see the potential in your home that is hidden by needed maintenance, cluttered rooms or over-stuffed closets.
“This year, I am much more experienced,” said the Media, Pa., native, who too is expecting a large contingent of friends and family in attendance. “Coming in as a freshman last year, I didn’t know what to expect.

I’ve also been working on my feet and trying some new ways to get on top.”

Ownership issues and limited financial maneuverability make it impossible to measure Gretzky's accomplishments here. What shouldn't be overlooked is that he brought relevance to a franchise that desperately needed it.
The Browns have gotten better in recent weeks at protecting McCoy and picking up the blitz. Rookie left guard Jason Pinkston is improving each game and Ogbonnaya, who will serve as the third-down back vs. the Bengals, is strong in blitz pickup. They'll need to be on point against an aggressive Cincinnati defense, one that's 10th in the NFL with 26 sacks. The Bengals are on pace for 42, which would be the most in coach Marvin Lewis' nine seasons.

Q. When I teach traffic-school classes, I'm amazed at how cavalier people are about the law that forbids entering an intersection after the light turns red. They seem to feel entitled to do so without the "hassle" and high cost of such citations from red-light cameras. They seem to conveniently overlook that they broke the law. During a break for a class in Anaheim Hills, an older man who wasn't a student stopped by to ask, "How do you beat the red-light cams?" I said, "Stop for the red."

Ohio lawmakers have mercifully ended the tawdry Statehouse war over new congressional district boundaries. The best that can be said for Substitute House Bill 369, which Gov. John Kasich signed Thursday, is that Ohio will now hold one 2012 statewide primary election (March 6), not two.

But "Coriolanus" belongs to Cox. The veteran character actor ("Troy," "Braveheart," Bournes "Identity" and "Supremacy," and so on) steals the show as the wily politician Menenius. It is delicious to watch him coaxing and cajoling with the slick finesse of a D.C. lobbyist. Saying volumes with the arch of a brow and the tilt of his head, using a mirthless laugh for punctuation, Cox is the grease that keeps the wheels of this complicated narrative moving along.

Donald J. Heller, who drafted the death penalty initiative in 1978, now regrets it. "The cost of our system of capital punishment ... is so dollar-wasteful that it serves no effective purpose," he told the New York Times. Ron Briggs, who helped get the death penalty on the ballot back then, also has changed his mind and put another initiative on the ballot this year to convert all death sentences to life imprisonment without parole. Administering life sentences is far cheaper than capital punishment, according to a recent state report.

This isn't an early-morning spot unless you want to hit the Saturday market or a coffee shop, such as Tre Amici at the Bunker right across from the market. Better to save your ramblings for later in the day, when you can pop into some of the vintage clothing stores that make their home there. Grand dame of them all is La France, which was a pioneer in Ybor's renaissance back in the early '80s. Clothes representing all eras and styles are smartly displayed and organized, and the day we were there we spied an old Michigan basketball uni and a World War I uniform, complete with cavalry boots. Down the street are Revolve Clothing Exchange and Jezabelle & Her Wandering Gypsies. If you're looking for gifts or jewelry, the smallish Mermaid's Slipper has an artful collection that skews toward older tastes. Centro Ybor, the family-oriented shopping mall plopped between Seventh and Eighth avenues back in October 2000, features smaller restaurants like Hamburger Mary's, a gay-friendly spot that features drag queen bingo some nights.

The record for attendance is still the Feb. 27, 1982 game between Rutgers and West Virginia, which drew 9,000 fans — where the Scarlet Knights defeated the No. 6 Mountaineers.

It's actually been very, very strange. Obviously again, going back to it, this match is for such a prestigious title, and of course, with the roles reversed, I think that element, Daniel has had a very successful second half of the year, just like myself. Obviously I think he's become a little bit befuddled with the championship, over-obsessed with the championship, as well. He's done everything he can to keep it. Really, his character has changed a lot from this time last year.

Q: One of the arguments that Superintendent Gandara made in defending his record is that the bottom line is that the performance in schools improved under him.

But the city's position doesn't hold water. Lots of other jurisdictions have figured a way to make reservoirs and recreation compatible.

Investors are still worried that the U.S. may fall into another recession.

There's no need to be a cocktail expert, as the bar staff is quite knowledgeable and helpful. Our bartender, Mark, was more than happy to take the time to discuss the finer points of various cocktails and offer his recommendations.

This recipe calls for the citrus segments to be supremed - removed from the peel, pith and membrane. It makes for a beautiful presentation, but can be labor-intensive. If you're pressed for time, simply separate the segments or slice the fruit into rounds. It's easy to overspice the yogurt, so just add a dash at a time, and adjust according to your taste. The yogurt can be made up to 2-3 days ahead, and the fruit can be cut at least 1 day in advance.
In main courses, stuffed Idaho trout ($18) seemed like a pleasant throwback to the days of Continental cooking. The head was left on, but the body was boned, stuffed with a mixture of fresh chestnuts and Brussels sprouts and swaddled in bacon.

We chose the Tahitian Lounge for cocktails when the lingering light of late sunsets — or the sparkling skyscrapers of Hong Kong — offered vistas. Otherwise, we preferred the Casino Bar, where we listened to Aussie David Crathorne play show tunes and old favorites.

This sets up an unusual dilemma for a Republican governor who boasted of his disdain for Washington-driven solutions during his 2010 election.

It's hard, though, because so few of the people shivering on the stone steps that night had, as far as I could tell, ever fretted over how to send their children to college or even paid a student loan. They never wanted to belong to the masses who clock in every day, work overtime to help pay for their mortgage and a second car, and pay taxes that will help pay for two wars and corporate subsidies. Why should they? They sought the fringes of a society that seems to have less and less to offer the future. They said they wanted to join the growing national movement for economic equality and justice. But they were planning an exercise in direct democracy, exercising their right to assemble.
