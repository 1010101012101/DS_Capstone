The reason it's so crucial for politicians to activate both negative and positive emotions is that they are not, as our intuition would suggest, just opposites. Emotions such as anxiety, fear and disgust involve very different neural circuits than, say, happiness or enthusiasm. A candidate's job is to get all those neural circuits firing, both the ones that draw voters in and the ones that push them away from other candidates.

An old quarterback himself, Tressel was usually a realist about his signal-callers. He made his national championship quarterback, Craig Krenzel, a game-manager because the offense was based on Clarett's running. Tressel did not free Troy Smith to pass frequently in the spread offense until he saw proof of the 2006 Heisman Trophy winner's grasp of the scheme.

Some of the bigger names the Cardinals drafted -- including first pick Zack Cox, their third pick Tyrell Jenkins and second-day selection Austin Wilson -- are not certain signings and how the 2010 draft is remembered will certainly be based on getting at least Cox, a sophom0re-eligible third baseman from the University of Arkansas, under contract by August. After all, with Cox's bat, his position and his pedigree as a college ballplayer, it's possible to see how he could zoom through the system and create a situation where the team's three most recent first-round picks (ahem, still in the organization) could meet on the same team, at some point (2012?).

Questions of politics mingling with science have come up before with this scientific advisory panel. In 2002, critics accused the administration of then President George W.

The fights that arise almost daily are quickly ended, and most often without serious injury. And the good citizens among the student body are quick to tell Johnson or the other officers when trouble is afoot.

Bittová was introduced to American audiences in 1989, when she made her first trip to New York City to perform at the Knitting Factory. She and her drummer were on a bill with guitarist Fred Frith and cellist Tom Cora. "It was a very important moment for me," Bittová recalled. "Fred just asked, 'Let's improvise some music together, the four of us.' At that time I was so shy. I had never played with such good musicians. They were so good, and I liked them so much, I was a little bit nervous in the first minute, but I decided, OK, just go, because it was a very beautiful night, and we were in a very good mood. And from that time my improvising started to grow up. It was a very important moment and a very good one. This was my first improvising." Bittová became one of the musicians featured in the 1990 documentary film about Frith, the aptly titled "Step Across the Border."

Other readers have commented over the months that they believe there is or was an entity that created the world. But they perceive this to be a different kind of creator. This creator, let's call it Y, is not actively working in the world. This "Y" may have had an intention when the world was created, but it is doing nothing to change the course of the world today. It does not judge what is happening as good or bad. It may or may not be aware of what you and I are doing, but even if it is, it cannot or will not act. If this is your belief, vote for Option 2: I believe there is or was a creator, but the creator does not act in the world today.

The Blazers some how put together a 15-0 run, a run of four points more than they scored in the entire fourth quarter against the Philadelphia 76ers, and then a jumper in the lane from Brandon Roy cut the score to 96-95.

Michael Caine doesn't need a starring role to bring an otherwise lifeless film to life. In this visionary yet inert dystopian drama, he has a role one size larger than a cameo—an aging, pot-dealing hippie. Nevertheless, the screen throbs with energy when he's on it, and the energy sags when he's not. The setting is England in 2027, when world-wide infertility threatens the end of human life.

It would make more economic sense for health insurance companies to set a premium for their basic all-inclusive policy and set a higher premium for policies excluding contraceptive coverage.

Believe it or not, some hotels tack on a fee for their bellhops and concierges -- two optional services that guests usually pay for with tips. At one hotel, motivational speaker Barry Maher was hit with a mandatory fee for bellhop service. "Never mind the fact that I rolled my own roller bag to the room and never even saw a bellman," he says. He also found a fee for housecleaning on his final bill. "Mentioning that I write and speak on customer service got the first fee removed," he recalls. "But I think I just shrugged and shook my head over the housekeeping fee." A lot of other hotel guests, do too. What if you don't pay a fee for cleaning the room? Will they refuse to service your room? Come on.

It's becoming an expectation here. We're not being arrogant. We don't prepare for the City (championship); we expect to win the City. We're preparing for the states.

A screed might have made for a more interesting movie -- "October Baby" isn't exactly an edge-of-your-seat experience -- but I'm not sure it would have made it a better one. Yes, there are a few straight-ahead religious lessons, a few over-the-top treacly scenes. If you cast John Schneider in your film, I'm not sure anything else is possible.

It was designed to showcase the Inner Harbor, the Baltimore Convention Center and Oriole Park at Camden Yards. However, the very components that made the venue so compelling for spectators, drivers and TV viewers drove up costs considerably.

"I like to tell my patients, 'I'm preventing unplanned pregnancy one IUD at a time," said Perriera, who says that it's important for women to have birth control options that fit their lifestyle. She often recommends IUDs for women who smoke and should not use estrogen-based birth control methods, and for women who don't like taking a pill every day.
Hutchens, Sandra. The new sheriff in town, she came out of nowhere (well, L.A. is nowhere, isn't it?) in the last three weeks of the appointment derby to beat out everyone for the job, including the well-regarded Santa Ana chief of police, Paul Walters. The efforts by Ron Cedillos, Mario Rodriguez, the California Women's Leadership Association and some former L.A. sheriff's brass to get her into office is one of the most impressive grassroots campaigns in local political history. I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the role of a certain metro columnist in "introducing" her to the county at large and then going out on a limb - a brittle twig, actually - to predict she would be selected. That guy ought to be enshrined somewhere.

And there's a larger issue here: Why are the digital-music choices all variations on a theme? Rhapsody hasn't abandoned its all-you-can-eat subscription model, which lets you browse and listen to millions of songs for a monthly fee -- pretty close to the "celestial jukebox" talked up by music fans for years. But the celestial-jukebox model remains largely grounded, despite its theoretical elegance. Subscription plans like Rhapsody's sound, look and feel much like jukebox software -- you can bookmark artists, build playlists and do most anything you can with jukebox software like iTunes. Who cares that the songs sit on someone else's hard drive instead of yours? But for whatever reason, consumers do.

It's a few hours after the curtain has dropped on a preview performance of "Cities," just days before the show's Thursday opening at the Booth Theatre.

This is not a matter of age appropriateness (AA); it's a matter of dignity. In my book, there may not be a sharply defined perimeter fencing off the concept of aging, but there are absolutes where "the dignity index" is concerned. Madonna, a former hero, fell off my dignity index long ago (witness her recent fishnet fiasco, if you dare); conversely, Victoria Beckham skyrocketed up the index the moment she began dressing properly, stopped singing, returned to her natural brunette and got a decent day job.

That's a promising model for any school. Individual parents who see weaknesses at their schools can complain to the principal or even the school board, but they have little chance of making an impact. The Parent Teacher Assn. functions more as a support organization for schools than as a mechanism for change. Parents might not even know that other families share their frustrations. A well-run organization that engages parents in improving education can be a powerful force even when it is a relatively quiet one. Many parents, rather than seek to overthrow their schools, want to work with them.
Those quibbles aside, the bottom line on "The Woman in Black" is that it is a very spooky movie. Old-fashioned and old- school, it makes a convincing case for life after death and, for Radcliffe, life after Harry Potter.

Scott has stayed with his rotation throughout the early portion of the season, giving his second unit plenty of meaningful minutes. The coach wants to keep his starters fresh given the condensed schedule and, on the majority of nights, the bench is delivering.

He's already the team's best player at age 19.
Welser-Möst found some welcome warmth in the desolation of the first movement (those lone woodwind solos were real people). But the subsequent movements, though dashingly executed and thrillingly ear-splitting, lacked a certain something. Call it weight, call it theatricality.

The Snowga group moved through a series of poses intended to warm the body head to toes, then moved on to classic poses such as warrior one, triangle and yoga mudra.

On one run they practiced mountain pose again, this time on skis, arms raised, gliding down the mountain in lyrical, serpentine style without poles.

The beauty of this wilderness is often described as "indescribable." Nowhere are the skies so clear, the mountains so jagged and black, or the landscapes so glaring as in Antarctica. The sight, clamor and smell of penguin colonies that number in the hundreds of thousands are a sensory overload. Pods of killer whales swam at our ship's bow as albatross rode the winds that glanced off our stern. We watched and listened as glaciers calved into icebergs; and older icebergs floated around us in otherworldly shapes and brilliant electric blue. Fur seals snarled and lunged as we passed them on the beach, and penguin chicks pecked curiously at our clothing as we sat and watched them.

Together, they turn Manhattan into little more than a shooting gallery, stacking up corpses in service of a supposed story about one man's path to redemption. But really, all they care about is stacking up corpses, ripped apart by as many bullets as possible, with a few snapped necks and other more intimate moments of savagery to break up the tedium of the gunplay.

Interestingly, the Minnesota Vikingscoaching staff used McClellin primarily at strong-side linebacker during the Senior Bowl week. They obviously use the same defense as the Bears.

Other awards-voting procedures work differently, balancing the passion behind favorite choices and other picks in different ways. Major League Baseball's Most Valuable Player awards are given to players who get the most points, with first-place votes counting the most, second-place votes less and so on. The National Football League takes a simpler approach in voting for its MVP. Voters list one name and the top vote-getter wins. "We always thought it was clean and focused on a single individual," says Terry Taylor, sports editor of the Associated Press, which hands out the award. "We didn't want someone winning the award who didn't get the majority of first-place votes."

Luke Winn, SI.com: "You're more than welcome not to believe in Kentucky, especially if what you saw on Sunday reinforced any of your preexisting doubts about this team: that it's too young to stay composed in a tourney environment, that freshman point guard Marquis Teague, who went 0-for-7 from the field against Vandy, hasn't developed into a championship-caliber floor leader; that the Wildcats aren't playing their best basketball heading into the dance; or that John Calipari-led teams have a way of choking in their biggest moments.
