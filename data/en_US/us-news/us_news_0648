“I think when we beat the Jets out here, and the spark when Victor (Cruz) made the catch and made that long run, when we won that football game, I was like, ‘We could do this,'" he said. "Then we beat Dallas. Honestly, when we got in the playoffs, I didn’t think we were going to lose just because of the talent level that we have in this locker room. If we could get on the same page ever at some point during the season, I knew we’d be all right because honestly I haven’t been around a team like this before – physically, mentally. It’s a mentally tough football team. There are so many times we came from behind in the fourth quarter and pulled them out.

"True Blood" (HBO), "The Walking Dead" (AMC) and "American Horror Story" (FX): This terrific terror trio has upped the guts-and-gore factor in the cable realm, but each of the three leading supernatural series has served up some memorably chilling moments. Each has had its share of hey-wait-a-minute moments as well, and "True Blood" is probably the best of them. But the vampires of "True Blood," the zombies of "The Walking Dead" and the oddball ghosts of "American Horror Story" have pushed horror to haunting new heights on TV.

The larger lesson is that, contrary to conventional wisdom, American politics have not become insensitive to the "the people." In many ways, just the opposite is true. Politicians are too responsive to popular will. The real Washington is in the business of pleasing as many people as possible for as long as possible. There are now vast constituencies dependent on the largesse of the federal government. This is the main cause of huge "structural" budget deficits, meaning that they aren't simply a hangover from the Great Recession.

I never understood the logic behind withholding the "closer" title from Fernando Salas or Jason Motte or, way back in 2006, Adam Wainwright. Actions always speak louder than titles.

Football gamers have seen how a monopoly can hinder the development of a series with "Madden," but hoops junkies would certainly take a monopoly over the current arrangement: a big pile of nothing.

He uses the tale to trace the fascinating decline of Peking into a hell of opium dens and whorehouses -- populated by corrupt British colonials and desperate White Russians who treated the local Chinese like indentured servants.

There hadn’t been a major mid-level concert hall in the North Jersey suburbs since the demolition of the Capitol Theatre in Passaic two decades ago. Now there was a new one, and Montclair had it. And it wasn’t just a generic performing arts center, either: It was a gorgeous old movie palace with a domed ceiling, a balcony and a large elevated stage.
Inspectors from the Minnesota Department of Health conducted an "onsite review" last week at the request of the U.S. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the hospital confirmed Friday.
You know the TSA. We're the ones who make you take off your shoes before padding through a metal detector in your socks (hopefully without holes in them). We're the ones who make you throw out your water bottles. We're the ones who end up on the evening news when someone's grandma gets patted down or a child's toy gets confiscated as a security risk. If you're a frequent traveler, you probably hate us.
"What I can confirm to you is that we are in fact still in negotiation with Walmart (and others) and if and when we have a final, formal agreement, I will definitely provide you with an announcement."

A 15-minute wait wasn't an auspicious beginning to what I've previously considered a four-star meal. Neither was the host, dressed in black leggings that ended just above the knee, black ballet-like slippers and a pink top made of T-shirt material. She looked as if she was going to a yoga class rather than presiding over one of the most elegant restaurants in San Francisco.

Some of these people work from home for companies in a different region. Some are traditional road-warriors who travel all over. Some, like Dobbins-Baxter, have a regular commute, just one that spans states instead of a county line.

2009 Pillsbury Wine Company Chardonnay, Arizona ($16) - (Tasting notes from a barrel sample.) The color is a light, clear, white ring-gold. The aroma has some high-toned tropical fruit that's in balance in the front. The taste has wonderful, tight, Chardonnay richness; it's a little ripe on the middle and finish, with a good dry structure. 88 points.

The superintendent had doubts about wood heat. "I literally pictured smoke coming out of a chimney. I pictured my people shoveling in pellets and shoveling out ash all day long."
Seeing "Oh, Coward!" prompts the awareness that our modern sense of "seen it all" ironic detachment is missing one important element: fun. The English writer, composer, and performer Nöel Coward, whose work this play celebrates, is no stranger to the cutting remark nor the sneer. But all that swagger is shot through with a keen awareness of the silliness of it all.

Opening Friday, March 16, through April 14: For the third full-length production of Buntport's 11th season, join a near life-size version of Tommy Lee Jones as he waxes poetic about cowboy boots, his life as a movie star and his love of opera - particularly Puccini's "Turandot." Operated by three Buntporters and voiced by a fourth, this lookalike of the beloved actor sits in a café, enjoying a good slice of pie, and takes you on a journey, aided only by his waitress and the odd salt shaker or two. A puppet show unlike any you have ever seen.

When King took over her father's business, she also began competing in fitness competitions, following up on a longtime interest in sports and nutrition.
The fact that Lake Michigan was spared in the end doesn't justify the shrugging of shoulders since. The National Transportation Safety Board is now past its second self-suggested reporting date on the cause of the pipeline break. Congress made a small stab at increased safety with a bill that increases the number of federal pipeline inspectors and hikes fines for violations.
Today, people come to the Point Reyes National Seashore for the dramatic natural beauty, the sense of wilderness and the chance to see more than 1,000 plant and animal species, including whales, elephant seals and many different kinds of birds. At Tomales Point, more than 400 tule elk roam through the fog (and bugle, in season), and smaller herds may be seen near Limantour and above Drake's Beach. Drake's Bay is named for Sir Francis Drake, said to have landed on the peninsula in 1579, but the Coast Miwok Indians lived on Point Reyes Peninsula some 5,000 years ago.
Authors Nicole Blum and Debra Immergut will discuss and sign their new book "Improv Sewing" from 6 to 9 p.m. Tuesday at Fancy Tiger Crafts, 59 Broadway.

No. 1 Kentucky (34-2) vs. No. 4 Indiana (27-8), 6:45 p.m., Channel 2: Indiana beat Kentucky, 73-72, on Dec. 10 on a buzzer-beating three-pointer by Christian Watford, and the Wildcats have lost once since. If Indiana is to pull the upset, it needs to make its three-pointers. The Hoosiers are second nationally in three-point percentage at 43.7; Kentucky allows foes to make 31.7% from beyond the arc. Both have excellent freshman centers in Cody Zeller (Indiana) and Anthony Davis (Kentucky), but as good as Zeller has been this season, Davis has played at a different level, especially on defense. Davis had only seven points in the first meeting, and it would seem a priority to make sure he gets touches early in this one. Indiana generally rebounds well, but can the Hoosiers keep the Wildcats off the offensive glass? Indiana's ballhandling also bears watching; the Hoosiers struggled against Virginia Commonwealth's attacking defense.

Since then, TV Azteca has been fined millions of dollars by the IFE. A TV Azteca spokesman declined to comment.
The Vikings estimate their attendance is up 60 percent over last year, fueled at the start of camp by thoughts that quarterback Brett Favre might come out of retirement. Favre stayed retired, but the fans kept coming.
Corum estimates that among major metropolitan areas in the U.S., the greater Portland vicinity has more farmers markets per capita than any other place, including Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, San Francisco and Saint Paul, Minn.

Americans, whether they favor or oppose abortion, cannot mutely accept the continued dismantling of the Constitution by a man whose oath was to preserve, protect and defend it.
Two options before RTD delay completion of the Northwest line to 2024, a four-year lag from the earlier-promised 2020. One of those options opens a number of park-n-Rides with interim bus service while delaying by six months six other FasTrack lines.
And he still seems to have that knack for coming through in the big spot. In the Giants’ first homestand, they won two games in their final at bat. In each of those wins, the man who took the final swing of the bat was, you guessed it, Cabrera. In fact, in the Giants final game before they came here to New York, they beat the Phillies, 1-0, in 11 innings with Cabrera lining a one-out single to center to deliver the game’s only run. The Giants came flying out of the dugout to mob Cabrera, who romped around like a kid.
Set Mandy up. Start with training in front of the garage, opening and closing it. With your training treats handy, start asking Mandy to do a behavior, such as sit or follow, and reinforce her behavior with treats.

“They want to stay loose where they are with their shoes off,” said DJ Kelly Cole, a Hollywood deejay who spun at Kate Beckinsale’s wedding. The music is crucial to the whole party and it’s neither the time nor place for something unsophisticated like the “YMCA” song, so event planners recommend professionals with experience outside of weddings to ensure the desired club feel.
12:04 -- Give Eli Manning time and more than likely, he'll make you pay. Such was the case on 18-yard pass to Hakeem Nicks, who made a great leaping catch. The Giants are now on the New England 47.
LaRod Stephens-Howling returned a kick 96 yards for a TD and Michael Adams returned a fumble 30 yards for a score for the Cardinals (3-5), who appeared to have the win sealed after stopping the Vikes on fourth down from the 1 with just over six minutes to play and a 24-10 lead.

There's no point in writing about how heartbreaking this museum is. The marks on one wall where the Franks measured Anne and her sister Margot's height brought me immediately to tears, which I think affected my children more than what they were seeing — the tears and the utter weighted silence of the adults around them. When we left, they were subdued for some minutes, contemplating the short lives of children just like them, and we talked about what we had seen off and on during our trip.
Evangelicals who did not actually become Catholic nonetheless began borrowing some Catholic concepts - about social justice and natural law, for example - from Catholicism, and deployed terms like John Paul's "culture of life."

This is like being at a funeral
He's also loyal. Redfern won the chairmanship in late 2005 largely because of Strickland's support. If Strickland decides to run, Redfern would try to be helpful.

Rating: TWO STARS 2002 Iron Horse Russian Cuvee Green Valley ($31) The Russian Cuvee - essentially a higher-dosage classic vintage brut - was originally created for the historic Reagan-Gorbachev summit meetings, which worked toward ending the Cold War. Perhaps that extra sweetness made a difference - it does with food, as the wine is sweet enough to pair with select desserts. There is roast cranberry, just-ripe pineapple, toasty apple and wet stone with a nicely textured finish.

"We've never seen that medical evidence. We now know from the prison doctor that the cancer experts were not absolute in their view that al-Megrahi only had three months to live, so there is a lot of confusion here," Annabel Goldie, a Conservative Party lawmaker in Scotland's Parliament, said today.
Although the cheese selection ($15) sits atop the menu as well as on the dessert menu, we tried it at the end. This was a cipher, with dressed greens next to wedges of blue, goat and soft cow's milk sitting on a slather of berry puree. The flavors clashed, and I kicked myself for not asking for more details before ordering.

I went home that night and as I lay awake thinking of Raleigh and his family, I felt truly blessed to be able to be a part of something so special. Raleigh was an integral part of this couple's life. He went everywhere with them swimming rivers and lakes throughout Oregon, hiking the cascades and snow shoeing in the Mt. Hood wilderness.
A variable Standard had going for him -- as did VanZant, Ford and Ball -- was that he was the starting running back for at least three seasons. There have been great running backs who didn't emerge as the leading ball carrier until their junior or senior seasons, and thus they didn't approach the career rushing mark. Topping that list is Althoff's Hickey Thompson, who in 1990 rushed for 3,105 yards, which is the top area single-season mark of the last 30 years. Thompson didn't have another 1,000-yard season.
That made Broughton just as guilty, Anderson argued.
The litany of significant cars he created is long, running from the original 1962 Cobra through a sojourn at Chrysler that included work on the Viper, and a stint with GM via a failed Oldsmobile-powered car, then back to Ford. He was involved with development of Ford's GT 500 Mustang, the 2013 version of which is certified by the Society of Automotive Engineers as the most-powerful regular-production car in the world.

Mr. Romney's thinking is very different, stressing more innovation, more individual choices and lower government spending. He proposes to get federal spending to less than 20% of GDP in his first term in office.

LeGrand told The Associated Press that he will not be paid by the team and that the signing is a symbolic gesture. "They can't give me any money with the salary cap and all that kind of stuff," he said.
Kale is about as unlikely a food star as you can imagine. It's tough and fibrous. Bite a piece of raw kale, and you'll practically end up with splinters between your teeth.

There are trade-offs to working exclusively with machines. Metheny can’t improvise as much as he usually does, though there will still be plenty of on-the-spot virtuosity on this tour. And no android will ever lay down a groove like former Pat Metheny Group drummer Antonio Sanchez.

It holds my night-on-the-town earrings and it's the prettiest heirloom I own. Well, up to now. Since the new de Young is a public institution, I think my mother and I own a piece of that, too. After all, her name is on the wall. As she always said to me, "Anything I have is yours, honey."

I can understand why a car rental company might be hesitant to record any prior damage. The forms that it uses are often small and don't allow for a precise notations to be made. Any time I've pointed out a problem on my vehicle, it's been with a rough "X" or checkmark. If, as a customer, I can use that sketch to get me off the hook for damages that I may be responsible for, then of course a car rental company would balk at using it.

SPECIAL TEAMS: Injuries have affected both teams' return games, with Amendola going down for the Rams and Reed, who returned a kickoff 77 yards for the Ravens last Sunday, out for a couple of weeks with a shoulder injury. Rookie Greg Salas has taken Amendola's place; he botched a punt Monday that led to a Giants score. Lardardius Webb, LaQuan Williams and Smith could factor in the return game this week. The Ravens are averaging 35.8 yards per kickoff return, 13 more than the Rams. However, St. Louis' coverage unit has been stingier. Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff is 4-for-4 on field-goal attempts and has touchbacks on seven of 10 kickoffs. Josh Brown has made five of six field-goal tries, while Donnie Jones has averaged 43.8 yards per punt for the Rams.

Obviously, "discount" is a word that the travel industry throws around a lot without much discipline or regard for accuracy. At one point, the big airlines hyped their restricted excursion fares as "discount" fares, compared with full-fare coach. Sure, some travelers actually sometimes have to pay full-fare coach, but the restricted excursion fare is really a completely different product, and you can't compare it with unrestricted full fare. Thankfully, airlines no longer do that, but the industry still often refers to "discount fares" when it really means "promotional fares." And lots of travel writers still refer to Southwest, Allegiant, EasyJet, Spirit, and other such lines as "discount" airlines or "discounters," which, of course they are not.

Czech and Moravian folk songs have long been part of Bittová's repertoire, but in this case the jazz-based arrangements took more liberties with the time and the harmonies. The integrity of the songs, however, was never in danger. "If you have a good basic sense of melody or story, then if you feel free and you have good friends around you, you can just fly and go to another space, and you can change the color of the song a little bit," Bittová said. "But I believe that we didn't really break down the real meaning of each song -- that's still there, and Janacek is still there. We were not revolutionaries. We were just trying to make new abstractions and bring our musical language to the song."
