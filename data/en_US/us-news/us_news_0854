Chester Upland School District outside Philadelphia, where budget cuts forced layoffs of 187 of the district's 320 teachers. The district is also in jeopardy of not meeting its payroll after emergency funding runs out.
The music channels heightened characterization akin to opera. The piano, cast as Prometheus, struggles mightily, unloading fierce attacks in the basement of the instrument before turning to intensely chromatic stop-and-go figures. The orchestral writing is dense, tactile, with spikes of brass and percussion that give way to affecting subtleties  a passage for horns and trombones hovering over pizzicato cellos or sly episodes in which a primordial contrabassoon or bass clarinet churns down in the depths.

Also try: There is a concentration of Mexican and South American eateries in Hillsboro, and Taqueria Ochoa (943 S.E. Oak St., Hillsboro; 503-320-6189) is one of the most authentically delicious. Tacos, a bargain at just a buck a piece, are a highlight and come with just about any filling you can imagine, from the usual carnitas and chicken, to juicy and flavorful cuts such as lengua (tongue) and cabeza (head). People travel from miles around to chomp down on the burgers at Helvetia Tavern (10275 N.W. Helvetia Road, Hillsboro; 503-647-5286), where the crispy fries and juicy cheeseburgers are just about as cool as the rustic and bucolic farmland setting. The pies at Earth Oven Pizza (337 E. Main St., Hillsboro; 503-747-7743; earthovenpizza.com) give Hillsboro residents a great reason to order out.

In Cleveland, foreign dollars helped to restart the Flats East Bank, a $275 million development that includes an office building, a hotel and retail. When the economy shuddered, the project stalled and shrank.

The first phase of the project could employ 2,300 construction workers and 2,000 people after completion.

As Mayo plied the seas, his exploits grew more spectacular. While protecting a schooner returning freed slaves to a new settlement in Africa, he suffered musket burns when he came face-to-face with King Crako, the chief of a local tribe.

These investors fear that the dollar's value will shrink because the Federal Reserve intends to ease more money into circulation to keep interest rates low and spur growth in the economy. And the dollar compared with other major currencies did shrink, making oil here more expensive.
We applaud Mayor Rahm Emanuel's creative approach in identifying unique ways to improve our city while focusing on job creation. The Chicago Infrastructure Trust is the first of its kind in the nation. With federal and state money continuing to be sluggish, the mayor had to look to private sources to build public infrastructure. Combining the trust with federal and state money, as well as ongoing capital investments from the city and sister agencies, there will be more than $7 billion in infrastructure work over the next 10 years.

Opposition's best point: That implementing Hometown Democracy could lead to ugly campaigns and that local residents still might not get what they want. It's true that if, for instance, a developer wanted to put a massive development way out in east Orange County, he might be able focus the entire campaign on persuading residents in the rest of the county — who won't be as impacted by it — to support it. This amendment would punch many a campaign consultant's meal ticket.

"I think the interesting thing (about families) is that unless you do some kind of violent wrenching, you've got to stay together, you don't have a choice. Friendships don't particularly interest me.

The compromises people make for another and the lifelong wounds and all that stuff is just fascinating to me."
Cross-examining Schurick, Deputy State Prosecutor Thomas M. McDonough contended that despite what Schurick was claiming, the math didn't work out. For every 10,000 voters targeted, if 7 percent voted for Ehrlich, Ehrlich would get 700. But his opponent would get 9,300.

The alleged target was Al-Jubeir, a commoner educated at University of North Texas and Georgetown who was foreign affairs adviser to Saudi King Abdullah when he was crown prince. A month after the 2001 attacks, in which 15 of the 19 Arab hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, Abdullah sent al-Jubeir to the United States to rebuild Saudi Arabia's image in the United States. He was appointed ambassador in 2007.
But some police departments don't seem to mind. Often police will announce beforehand that they'll be conducting a sobriety checkpoint, but to give themselves some advantage, they keep the exact location secret. And for years, they've known that bartenders make announcements to patrons if they know there's a checkpoint happening nearby. Perhaps the warnings can serve as a deterrent, police say.
Bargaining for the contract, the pilots first since being organized by the Teamsters, lasted 3½ years.

CAIRO — When filmmaker and Egyptian democracy activist Amr Salama watched Hosni Mubarak's regime collapse in 2011, he couldn't have been more heartened.

A nice reward for the Big East's fourth-best team. Actually, the NCAA Selection Committee should acknowledge the tough economic times and do more of this to help fans. But this is the same group that sent Temple to Miami, where Utah, Arizona and Arizona State will be as well. Maybe a geography lesson is in order.
Salimi cooks the goat for his karahi in butter and corn oil, because the lean meat needs their richer flavor. But his lamb -- all local -- browns in olive and canola oils, which Salimi thinks help tone down any overly lamby taste.

For a country in which more than 50 percent of trade revenues are generated by oil, this tougher export environment is a big threat.
The Southern sympathizers were doing their best to maneuver their favorites, Joseph Lane and Delazon Smith, back into the U.S. Senate. Both had been elected by the Legislature in 1858, before Congress bestowed statehood. Lane had been the territory's first governor and later its delegate in Washington. Smith ("Delusion" to detractors) was the firebrand editor of the Oregon Democrat newspaper in Albany. Both were ardent secessionists.

The center is planned by Elad, a pro-settler group that runs archaeological digs in Silwan. It will be built above an excavation area called the City of David, leaving the ruins below accessible. The area is named for the biblical monarch thought to have ruled from the spot 3,000 years ago.
About 250,000 people have been displaced by fighting in eastern Congo, where rebels led by Laurent Nkunda are battling Congolese forces. The conflict is fueled by festering ethnic hatred left over from the 1994 slaughter of a half-million Tutsis in Rwanda, and Congo's civil wars from 1996-2002, which drew neighboring countries in a rush to plunder Congo's mineral wealth.
The groups, about 670 of them, came in all sizes and colors. People dressed up in superhero socks with capes on them or festive outfits, though many stuck to the orange-and-white event T-shirts.

When this Atlanta band's 2007 CD, "Cryptograms," came out, it surprised people who had heard only the chaotic "Turn It Up, Faggot." "Cryptograms" was ambient psych-rock, with compelling front man Bradford Cox at the center. Cox, whose tall, thin appearance is the result of Marfan syndrome, is a provocateur onstage, wearing dresses, using fake blood and generally inspiring audiences to love him or hate him. While he has referred to himself as a gay virgin, regardless of his sexual status Deerhunter has become one of the best rock groups around. Look for more poppy tunes from the noise band in the future: Cox has said he's now finding inspiration in doo wop. www.myspace.com/deerhunter.

The commissioner noted later that crime plummeted by 90 percent in the 75th Precinct during his 22 years of service there. Uniformed officers from the NYPD, Suffolk, and Nassau departments, state police from New York and New Jersey, and officers from upstate New York communities lined up to pay respect.

Ah, yes. That lob shot. If you want to know the difference between Hanson and Mickelson, you need only study what happened on the par-5 15th hole Saturday. Playing a hole apart, both players had found themselves with the same third shot behind the 15th green.

The data reflects only the 2010-11 school year, so we have no baseline to compare scores and can't see whether academic progress has improved over time. In a letter to the Sun-Times, Andrew Broy, president of the Illinois Network of Charter Schools, pointed out that "in 2011, of the 26 Chicago charter high schools with sufficient data over three years, 17 schools outperformed average growth in Chicago. Across all charter schools, the average growth rate of 3.8 scale points over those three years is 60 percent higher than the Chicago average, an average that includes selective enrollment high schools."

"To me, this film is to traditional gospel quartet singing and gospel music what (the 1977 TV miniseries) 'Roots' was to American history," says Tucker Jr., manager of the Hummingbirds, whose new album is "GPS: Gospel Praise Songs." "That's how I see it. 'Roots' tells the story of a people. But instead of a race of people, this is a group of people who decided to not let Jim Crow and racism . . . stop them from moving this genre forward. If this movie hadn't come out, I don't think this story would ever have been told."

Yes the mistrust of our public institutions and mere anxiety about our future economy are more the order than the exception. Three quarters of the people do not trust their government. More than half of the eligible citizens in California again decided not to vote in the last election. Why? Why the anti-government mood? I asked this same question four years ago and now I believe I understand. Simply put, the citizens are revolting against a decade of political leaders who righteously spoke against inflation and excessive government spending but who in practice pursued the opposite course.

But Romney's awkwardness seems to endear him to audiences, because he's trying so hard. He spends an enormous amount of time after the speeches shaking hands, taking pictures and holding babies.

The fact that "options are narrowing" is not a bad thing; it is a result of the Supreme Court's decision in Furman v.

Losing to Crystal Palace Baltimore at the lacrosse field of University of Maryland Baltimore County. It was a regular season match and really didn't matter all that much. But when you're present and completely sober for a loss to the worst team in the league in the most laughable stadium you have ever found yourself in, it's gutting.
