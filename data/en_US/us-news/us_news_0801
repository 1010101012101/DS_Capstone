Holding Long Reach's high-powered offense to only 26 points should be considered a minor accomplishment. But the rift between the top eight teams and the bottom four is still massive.

The number had been retired since Tripucka retired in 1963. Tripucka was the Broncos' first quarterback and the first NFL/AFL quarterback to surpass the 3,000-yard milestone in a season. Tripucka told The Denver Post last week that he "would be honored" to have Manning wear No. 18.
The Spurs are 24-10, by the way. Manu Ginobili has missed 25 of those games, and is out for a few more weeks. Pop has five kids in his rotation, and the same ol' mantra: "If you don't (rest guys) now, I think you're asking for trouble later." We have a nagging suspicion that this group isn't quite as dead as Memphis made them look last spring.
"We have our orders," Captain America (Chris Evans) intones. "We should follow them."
Sure, the arrangement is Spector's, but it's Springsteen's Christmas spirit that makes this version so contagious. Captured live and loopy in his prime, Springsteen eases you in with a rap that sets the scene on his beloved Jersey Shore: "It's all cold down along the beach, the winds whipping down the Boardwalk." Then, he does some interacting with his bandmates, checking with Clarence to see if he's been rehearsing real hard so Santa will bring him a saxophone. And only then does Springsteen sing, turning in a performance that feels like every word was filtered through a smile.

"The whole time -- 'Why don't you come play with us?'" Berkman said of his sales pitch. "Particularly when (Chris Carpenter) was sort of questionable. My goodness, if Carp can't go, it would be perfect to have Andy step in and bridge that gap a little bit. If it had gotten to a certain point –- like if he wasn't able to get it worked out with the Yankees - then I was going to go to (GM John Mozeliak). He said hold off."

There is no clear favorite between the two schools. Patrick said the one thing that stood out to him after visiting Gainesville and Tallahassee on consecutive weekends, was FSU's Doak Campbell Stadium.

But with such a large field that includes three well-known politicians and multiple Latinos, vote-splitting is likely. Could Santiago and Cintron cancel out each other? How about Santiago and Cummins? Cintron and Nagin? Two of these eight will advance to the runoff, and it's possible it could be at least one if not two whom no one expected.
Dribbles: Daniel Gibson (ankle) and Anthony Parker (back) missed Friday night's game. Parker, who hasn't played since Jan. 29, could return to action next week.

Now the former Richmond police officer is poised to expand to El Cerrito, leasing the space of a former Togo's at 340 El Cerrito Plaza.
The White Sox might be the biggest surprise, since management appears to vacillate between keeping an old team together and rebuilding. The Sox won the World Series in 2005, but they have won one playoff game since then and attendance has fallen from 3 million to 2 million. But pitching wins, and the White Sox are the only AL team in the top three in earned-run average for starters and relievers.

How does something like this happen? That would be the question one suspects a movie like this would ask, but it doesn't. Instead, it just happens, the movie suggests, with seemingly no rhyme or reason. Kevin is not abused; if anything, he's coddled. He is just a bad guy, plain and simple.

As November nears, the question arises as to whether we should worry about what former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, does with his money or what President Barack Obama does with our money.
If that means adding academic and extracurricular activities, we concur. Instead of no 12th grade, Ohio's seniors need more challenging work in their last year of high school.

Some say Queen Esther's diet also included legumes, the "seeds" of bean pods, and adding garbanzo beans to the Purim meal is another way that Esther's diet is honored in many Jewish households.

China and its entrepreneurs disdain environmental concerns.
“There are other things we still need to work on, and I want to guard against thinking that we’re some invincible team,” Vermes said. “By no means have we proven that yet. We’ve made mistakes and there are some things we really need to work on, because if we give a team like LA with Keane or Buddle up top some of the chances that we’ve given away over the course four games, they’re going to punish us. We have to be a lot better in some of those situations.”
Even though grocery stores aren't always so photogenic, I suspect their mental images are deeply ingrained in most of our psyches. Think about that. Where did our mothers frequently take us when we were little? As those annoying Rally's commercials used to say, "You gotta eat."

The vandals were suspended for two days, but that's not the point. You could criss-cross the country and not find a better example of where we are when it comes to gay rights: Tolerant enough to agree that people shouldn't die simply for being homosexual, not quite respectful enough to resist defacing a high-school kid's poster.

Moreover, documents introduced in court showed frequent communication between a Murdoch lobbyist and the office of Jeremy Hunt, the minister in charge of deciding whether the bid to buy BSkyB was permissible underBritain'santi-monopoly rules.

Nimo flicked a left-footed pass to a wide open Ryan Pore on the opposite side of the box. Pore's blast from 18 yards out sailed wide of the near post.

He pointed out that in some cases it's best for both player and program for a student-athlete to transfer.
"Want to Go Private?" is a young-adult title, but it's definitely for older teens and more mature readers, and not only because of its overarching plot. Peppered with faux and acronymic profanities, the dialogue is realistically coarse, and some of the subject matter is sexually graphic, especially once BlueSkyBoi has persuaded Abby to take off her clothes before a Web cam for a guy she doesn't really know.

Today, the players who posted those pictures and walk by those walls make up one of the nastiest, most self-assured teams in football — one that can knock an opposing running back senseless then remind their next opponent about it, and one that certainly seems like they have no time for a sentimental exercise like the “Family Board.”

Enlisted troops opting for the second choice would then be able to choose which -- if any -- deployments their moral conscience is calling them.
