From an email I received:
Its distributor, Weinstein Co., made that choice because the film’s subject matter, the pervasiveness of school-related bullying and what can be done about it, would seem to cry out for a high school age and younger audience. And “Bully” has an emotional impact that must be viewed to be understood.

* Bill Self was 4-2 in the NCAA Tournament with Tulsa before taking the Illinois coaching job. That seemed to work out OK for the Illini. At Oral Roberts, then at Tulsa, Self's team's made it to the NCAA Tournament twice in seven seasons. John Groce took over a slumping Ohio U. program and got it into two NCAA tournaments in four seasons. His NCAA Tournament record was 3-2. Plus Groce has a Big Ten background (an assistant at Ohio State) and is already familiar with the recruiting terrain. I know that the Illinois coaching search was a messy process. But what's wrong with Groce? If you liked the Self hiring in 2000, then I'd think you'd be accepting of Groce. I say give him a chance. That's just me.

"I don't think our kids played with much effort," said Flashes coach Kathy Stricker. "We had our opportunities, but we booted a couple of balls and made a couple of errors and it compounded. But when you give up (18) runs, you don't deserve to win. I think that goes back to effort."

Now then, if there are no smells to caress my nose, and no sights to delight my eye, and no food to tickle my mouth, this gets us down pretty much to what we laughingly call my intellect. God knows I am not particular here, not anything like as particular as I am about oysters. I don't ask for talk about Proust, or familiarity with the cosmic ray theory, or acute critical appraisal of the latest Japanese painter; I can take such stuff or leave it alone, and I usually feel better when I am off it. But I do ask —what shall I say? Something that pricks my imagination a little, gives me some sort of lift, makes me feel that that day I heard something. And I am the sort that is as likely to get this from the common man as his more erudite cousin, the high-brow.

One evening's truffles - espresso, double chocolate, milk chocolate, caramel and goat cheese fudge - were fabulous. They're even better washed down with excellent French press coffee.

Tilling the soil and using concentrated nitrogen fertilizers accelerate humus decomposition.

The convention center prospect is highly problematic for leaders in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Each city already has a convention facility trying to survive in a single market.

Hours earlier, a new poll from Quinnipiac University showed Santorum losing ground to Romney in Ohio. Santorum leads Romney 35 percent to 31 percent among likely GOP primary voters. That's a narrowing of 3 points for Santorum since Monday, when Quinnipiac released a poll ahead of the Arizona and Michigan primaries, both of which Romney won. Another poll, released earlier this week by the University of Cincinnati, showed Santorum up on Romney by 11 percentage points.

âThe Avengersâ doesnât immediately inspire confidence â the editing of the opening raidâs eventual chase and shoot-out feels choppy and confusing, and the alien with whom Loki argues early in the film looks straight out of a low-budget kiddy show. But Whedon knows how to write an ensemble (just look at âBuffyâ and âFireflyâ), and when these larger-than-life characters start bouncing off one another, the witty repartee flies fast and furious, even in the midst of battle.

"As an organization we're made up of a group of overachievers and high performers," she said. "Oftentimes we have people who are that culture fit because we realize they have the ability to learn the technology, and the desire to work hard and to really apply themselves, and who are of this overachiever type personality, and lots of times this works in the organization even though they come in not knowing a lot about technology."
The facts are now flooding out in embarrassing detail, with a report in the Orlando Sentinel of credit-card bills showing hundreds of thousands of dollars for chartered planes, fancy dinners and big-time meeting costs.

At the beginning of previous calendar years, the Internal Revenue Service mailed out forms and instructions to those who had filed their preceding year's return on paper.

• Crawford finding comfort in new role with Trail Blazers -- Sam Amick, SI.com: But as was the case in Sacramento on Thursday night, when he hit just six of 17 shots overall and one of five three-pointers in a loss that dropped Portland to 13-10 overall and 3-9 on the road, Crawford has hardly been efficient. His 38.0 percent shooting is the second-lowest of his career, and his 32.3 percent from three-point range is his third-lowest. It should come as no surprise considering the adjustment, as the change of position means Crawford finds himself hunting for very different shots than he used to see from the off-guard spot.

Today was sort of a Rorschach test for the people who will help decide President Obama's opponent. For months, we've been told the No. 1 question about Romney is: Are you really a conservative? Despite previous endorsements (Chris Christie, Tim Pawlenty), the question has stubbornly remained. But now  and Coulter's street theater was a vivid display of this  we are starting to see people within the conservative movement look at the same candidate and with the same arsenal of facts come to entirely different conclusions. It's swift-boating all over again, only it's intraparty instead of partisan. On one side there's Ann Coulter saying: Of course he's a conservative. On the other side, an equally credentialed conservative like Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough saying: Don't make me laugh!

PHILADELPHIA -- The Gladiators had been overlooked in all the hype over this year's talented Philadelphia Soul team.
Any concern that Tigers fans should have deals squarely on the rotation. During the off-season, we thought that the Tigers' top four starters would rival any in baseball in terms of depth. But with the injury to Fister and the inconsistency of Scherzer and Rick Porcello, its gotten downright scary on nights when Justin Verlander isnt pitching. Drew Smyly has been a very nice addition and shows real promise with his ability to throw strikes and keep the game moving. But this is a very small sample size from a man who barely won the fifth starter job in Lakeland, so lets not pencil him in to start Game 2 of the postseason just yet.

If those tax revenues increase faster, the city's contribution to stadium operations and capital reserves would rise at the same pace -- but no more than 5 percent per year.

Without decisive action, we may well lose control of our schools and our destiny.

Our team has needs. Whether we can address that with one move or three moves, it’s hard to give you an exact number of how you fix what your roster needs.”
Bozza, executive director of the school administrators association, called the measure "poorly conceived public policy."

Thomas, who played well in spurts against Texas A&M after spending a lot of time on the bench against Louisville, finished with 17 points, the majority coming after the game had been decided.
Perhaps the most familiar of these is the basic white sauce, called Veloute for its velvety texture. A thinned out version becomes a gravy; a sweetened version makes a cream puff filling, and that thick cheese sauce that your mother poured over green vegetables to convince you to eat them when you were a child? It's a basic Veloute with cheese added. With the addition of egg whites and hot air, it becomes a souffle.
In the wake of the financial crisis following Lehman’s September 2008 collapse, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank law, and regulators have since meted out the rules. But the rules apply mainly to top corporate officers and give banks discretion on tying lower-level employees’ pay to risk.

Last week a group named "Reclaiming Missouri For Christ" (RMFC) gathered to distribute literature outside the Islamic Foundation of Greater St. Louis in Manchester. On the group's website, it is stated that RMFC is not an organization, but rather a vision and a mission. "We are to be reaching the unsaved with the blessed Gospel and then disciple them to Christian maturity. But we have abandoned evangelism. We no longer GO OUT to reach the lost." The group informed the local police that they would be distributing their literature outside the Islamic Foundation before and during the Friday congregational prayers. Next to the mosque is a library, gymnasium, and full time school with over 280 grade school students.
This transformation and growth was fueled by my travels. As I made my way around the world, I continued to learn more about what it means to be beautiful.

In Vietnam, women did not lather on suntan oil or flock to tanning salons. Instead, they covered themselves to maintain their pure white skin.

"Wish You Were Here" charts the rise of an international avant-garde as much as it does a local one. The museums and alternative spaces that sprang up in this period sponsored artists around the U.S. and Europe. Many of these figures were just passing through on their way to the next stop on the circuit. To twist a phrase of Gertrude Stein's about Oakland, there's precious little here in "Wish You Were Here."

So it's no wonder that company executives were in Washington, D.C., this month to lobby against the quick imposition of new clean air rules proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Cathy Woollums, chief environmental counsel for PacifiCorp's parent company, told lawmakers that compliance within the short time frame proposed by the agency would cause the cost of plant retrofits and new generation to skyrocket as parts and labor shortages outstripped supply.

It will take five votes out of eight to uphold any of the contested provisions of SB 1070, as Justice Elena Kagan will not be voting. Most of the justices seemed likely to uphold the controversial provision that requires state police to verify the immigration status of anyone stopped or arrested if they have "reasonable suspicion" the person is not lawfully in the United States.

So what's wrong with a little bit of post-publication background information? For me, it is possibility. As a graduate student of English literature, one of the things I most love about reading, and one of the first things I teach my students, is that you don't need to know whether Desdemona had sisters or what happened to Lady Macbeth's child to understand the work in front of you. Everything you need is at your fingertips. Your job as a reader is to use your imagination and analytical skills where the author has left off.

Folk singer-songwriter Patty Larkin has seen a complete overhaul in the way music is recorded, distributed and sold over the course of her 25-year career, but she's taking it all in stride. To celebrate the official quarter-of-a-century mark in 2010, she harnessed modern technology to produce a record that would've been nearly impossible to make back in the '80s: She re-cut 25 songs from throughout her career, each with a different guest artist (including the likes of Rosanne Cash, Suzanne Vega, Greg Brown, Lucy Kaplansky and Mary Chapin Carpenter) who then recorded tracks at their respective homes or local studios and digitally sent them to be added to the master tracks.

About half an hour east on 40, Kelbaker Road brings you into the preserve itself. Sixteen miles in is the turnoff for Kelso Dunes, 50 square miles of sand and little else. Some dunes are more than 600 feet high — worth singing about, and so they do, rather spookily, when the mood strikes them or a hiker kick-starts a cascade of sand. Wind-carved and yellow, these are the dunes of movies. It's easy to imagine C-3PO staggering over a crest, and several European hikers I met here half-joked that this was the only corner of the Southwest that looked like "real" desert.

After lunch, we decided to check in and explore Timberline Lodge, the historic hotel where we planned to stay. As Marc drove back up the mountain, I filled him in on the lodge's impressive pedigree. It was built in the late 1930s by Works Progress Administration workers willing to work in frigid temperatures and live in rugged encampments. Almost from the moment of its completion, Timberline was recognized as one of the great lodges of the Pacific Northwest. So arresting is its setting and architecture that its exterior was chosen to represent Overlook Lodge in the classic horror film "The Shining." It was named a National Historic Landmark in 1977.

There are 11 tracks on “Wrecking Ball.” Springsteen sang all but three of them at the Apollo. This may be an aberration, and as the tour progresses, he may return to set lists that feature mostly classic songs. He essentially abandoned prior album “Working on a Dream” during its accompanying tour in 2009, but that isn’t likely to happen in 2012: “Wrecking Ball” is exactly what he wants to say, and the Boss is standing behind this set with two feet planted on the ground and a fist in the air.

It got to the point where the crowd at TD Garden would rise to its feet whenever Rondo got the ball on a fast break, just knowing he was going to do something special. He got plenty of chances in Game 6 -- the Cavs turned the ball over a miserable 24 times, costing them 27 points.

The dispute stemmed from Renacci's trust income from an "S" corporation that was not subject to state taxes for several years before Ohio's tax commissioner issued a ruling that changed the state's policy. "S" corporations permit income to be taxed at an individual rate for federal tax purposes, and avoid double taxation on corporate income. Renacci was among a group of taxpayers who fought the state decision. Court records show the Renaccis eventually settled the tax dispute and sent the state more than $1.3 million.

Farm director John Vuch said a promotion to Class AAA "is not imminent." The Cardinals are eager to see how Wong does in the intimate eight-team Texas League when opposing pitchers and managers get to know him.

Trends to watch in season’s second half -- Zach Lowe, SI.com: Can Portland rediscover its identity before it’s too late? The Trail Blazers started off playing a turbo-charged pace and relentlessly attacking the weak spots in opposing defenses. The Blazers have maintained a top-notch defense in their own right, and though their offense has dropped off a bit, it still ranks among the league’s top 10. But there is lots of chaos here. The fast pace has vanished, the point guard situation is in flux, the play on the wing is inconsistent and scoring at the end of close games has been a problem. The Blazers have a scoring margin of minus-12.3 points per 100 possessions in the last five minutes of games in which the scoring margin is within five points, per NBA.com. This should be a dangerous team. Will Portland find itself?
