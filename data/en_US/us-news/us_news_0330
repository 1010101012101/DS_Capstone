In 2004 he convinced Bolen, who was an investment banker at Bear Stearns, to take the reins at the company where Eliza, who signed on in 1995, was already well ensconced. The threesome takes inspiration from multigenerational family firms like Hermès and Salvatore Ferragamo, who have so far held on to their independence despite encroachment from corporate conglomerates. In the past year and a half, a number of key players have joined the mix. Jean Zimmerman, a longtime Chanel executive, now consults at de la Renta as executive at large in the fragrance division, and Manolo Blahnik veteran Annelie Hofstrom oversees footwear, which Bolen hopes to turn into a $50 million entity within the next three years. In addition, Catherine Monteiro de Barros, founder and designer of the now defunct Papo D'Anjo, will helm the children's line (which will include clothing for boys and girls, infants to age 14), and Miles Redd, a well-known interior decorator who is already the creative director for Oscar de la Renta Home, will be in charge of the extensive new home-accessories line that is set to launch in late spring.

President Viktor Yanukovych spoke during a ceremony Thursday inaugurating the initial assembly of a gigantic arch-shaped steel containment building to cover the remnants of the exploded reactor. The structure - weighing 20,000 tons and big enough to house New York's Statue of Liberty - is due to be completed in 2015, allowing the delicate and dangerous job of dismantling the reactor and cleaning vast amounts of radioactive waste still around it to begin.
Coming less than 30 years after World War II ended, the choice of Munich as a venue had been controversial from the outset. More than most German cities, Munich had been closely associated with the rise of the Nazi Party. The first concentration camp, Dachau, was located on Munich's outskirts, and the Israeli team had visited the site just before the opening ceremony.
But it's almost as if it never dawned on the Heat and their admirers that the NBA would treat them so harshly, subjecting them to poor play and injuries … like everyone else endures.
“Vogue’s legendary editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, maintains her model-thinness through a power lunch consisting of rare red meat and a salad with no salad dressing,”
His decision to sucker-punch a glass case after losing to the Heat on Monday night was frustration, not selfishness. It was instinct, not premeditation. He screwed up. This is a man on a 29-year journey for inner peace who saw it slipping away again.
Declining to speak directly to reporters, Sinha’s statement also said, “we have full faith in the justice system and are now looking forward to a speedy trial...

I agree with the caller complaining about all the whining. It seems our whole country is spoiled. Look at the rest of the world. We are so blessed, yet we don't think its enough. We need to step up and be the great country we are, and solve problems like climate change and intolerance. Yes, times are hard, but our hard times are
The goal is to teach students to defend someone worthy of induction, compromise and make judgments.
Instead of trusting pet store employees, Scanlan suggests owners talk to their vet, learn to read pet food labels and check out studies in peer-reviewed journals. And should they want to upgrade their pet's food but find they just can't afford to, they shouldn't feel guilty.
In mid-January, my boyfriend, Rob, and I went to a jeweler in Towson to find a watch for him. Being a particular fellow, he spent over an hour trying on watches while I struggled to maintain interest. We then took a walk around the mall so he could mull over his choices, and by the time we returned I was ready for some Me time. I pointed to a canary-ish ring in the case and asked to try it on.
Mrs. Madsen's retirement did not bring an end to her teaching days. For more than a decade, she taught drama classes for inmates through Prison Performing Arts of St. Louis. Agnes Wilcox, artistic director for the organization, said Mrs. Madsen approached her prison students the same way she taught her Webster students, earning the respect and gratitude of the inmates.
St. Louis institution for more than 20 years. Maybe it's because the fish is always so fresh, leaving a pleasant (never overbearing) aftertaste that lingers once you leave. Maybe it's because prices are so reasonable. Maybe it really doesn't matter why it's one of my go-to restaurants. This visit, the snapper and tuna were exemplary, and the rolls, while a bit smaller than others we encountered, skillfully blended ingredients to bring out each flavor. Their quality and consistency is impossible to top.

Anticipating he had a winner on his hands, the neurologist applied for a patent on the test - but only, he said, to keep the technique from being commercialized by others. If it worked, he wanted the discovery he had taken so many years to find to be free to the public.
The agreement between federal authorities and the new owners of the Upper Big Branch mine includes $46.5 million in criminal restitution to the miners' families, $128 million to fund cutting-edge mine safety upgrades, research and training, and $35 million in penalties for federal mine safety violations, Goodwin said.

“But certainly it’s been done in other sports (the Rangers, Devils and Islanders of the NHL do it), and it’s something we would have to look at,” he said. “But all I know is that Newark has expressed interest in having its own team; I’ve heard Shaq (Newark native Shaquille O’Neal) say that he would like to be the owner of that team. And it’s a wonderful state — we’ve had a great history there.”

For the Steelers, who have clinched a playoff berth, it's a must-win game if they hope to win the division. Baltimore, also guaranteed a playoff spot, owns the tie-breaker over Pittsburgh, and would clinch the division title with a win at Cincinnati on Sunday. The Bengals, meanwhile, would lock up a wild card playoff spot with a win or tie against the Ravens.
OK, Tom. Let's put down the pompoms and actually talk numbers for a minute. If we use your logic of it being a sound investment to spend $175 million to attract fewer than a half-million people to town each year, then we should be giving Disney (which attracts somewhere around 40 million visitors) around $14 billion in tax money. The bottom line: The theme parks bring more people to Central Florida in a single week than the bowl attracts all year. You'd be better off touting a quality-of-life argument for sprucing up the bowl, rather than these economic-stimulus arguments that don't pass the straight-face test … unless you want to start cutting the construction checks yourself.

Money seemed to be the universal motivator in recruiting corruption. In 2008, The Bee reported that more than two dozen recruiters had broken laws or military rules, such as enlisting a recruit who had a criminal record for domestic violence, and fabricating pre-enlistment physicals. Such transgressions allowed them to meet quotas and earn performance bonuses.

The entire option hinges on voters approving a doubling of a 0.4-percent sales tax in November. But the issue may not even get to them.

-- Diverse cooking styles. The biggest change is the wide range of cooking styles among the four-star contenders. Most top chefs have moved way beyond the strict European approach, gently melding elements from Asia, Mexico and South America. Ron Siegel, who earned four stars at the now-shuttered Charles Nob Hill, made a splash when he implemented a Japanese kaiseki menu after moving to Masa's. He's now turned the uber-French Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton on its ear with several sashimi dishes.

Messages is a little bit fidgety in its current state. The old iChat-style AIM Buddy List sits awkwardly next to the slick iPad-style unified Messages window.

"I was just trying to get in the forecheck and got hit," he said Monday. "The only real point of contact was my head. I know it wasn't an elbow. It was a shoulder and I went down. I am happy I can continue without stopping playing and I will be in the lineup tomorrow."
Later during the 1960s, Peebles led a Harvard team that studied the tetanus vaccine. They found that the vaccine contained tens to hundreds of times the necessary dose of the tetanus antigen, creating a danger of allergic reactions that was greater than the risk of developing tetanus. They proved that a lower dose was safe and that it could be given much less frequently than was the current practice.

He speaks of expanding the availability of credit to small- and medium-sized businesses, investing in education, research, and infrastructure, and restoring a "robust" regulatory system to protect against a repeat of the financial collapse of 2008.
Upset at what they felt was an inadequate response from Hickenlooper toward fire victims, Republican lawmakers proposed a bill to create the special compensation commission. The commission also would have held hearings to investigate the fire.
That's not a lot. And the analysts say at least some of that increase will be eaten by an increase in Medicare premiums.
Parker honored: Cavaliers guard Anthony Parker is the recipient of the seventh-annual Austin Carr Good Guy Award, presented by the local chapter of the Pro Basketball Writers Association (PBWA).
That means being cautious with the number of competitions, and the wear and tear on her body within competitions.
McGee was described as "one of the busiest and most beautiful black actresses" by Times movie reviewer Kevin Thomas in 1972, the year she appeared opposite Fred Williamson in the black action movie "Hammer," and had starring roles in the crime- drama "Melinda" and the horror film "Blacula."

"You can’t go in with the idea that we’ve got three games to win one," Sixers coach Doug Collins said Monday at the team’s practice facility at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. "That’d be bad psychology. You got to go on the idea that we want to go to Chicago and we want to finish the series."
"Some would say the market is being surprisingly patient regarding these ongoing negotiations — but if this lack of progress ends up being a recurring theme it seems unlikely that traders will continue having such a sanguine view," he said.
Penn State now faces No. 13 Wisconsin in today's quarterfinals.
Clinton said he's here because he loves New Orleans, but mostly, "I'm here because you represent the future of this country."
The sound coming off Independence Boulevard torments Renee Siska day after day after day. One moment her Parma Heights home is quiet, the next. . . clink-clink! The two-beat tune bounces around her brain whenever a passing car rolls over a loose sewer cap (clink-clink!) or water valve discs (clink-clink!) on Independence at Brandywine Road.
Lohan's irregular attendance at the classes has been an issue for some time, and Lohan missed a progress review hearing in May. She claimed her passport was stolen while she promoting an upcoming film project at the Cannes Film Festival. Missing the hearing led to Revel to issue an arrest warrant, later revoked when Lohan's lawyer posted bail, and to order Lohan to wear an alcohol monitoring bracelet.
As a result, the Mets are left to do with Pelfrey's rotation spot what they are essentially doing with this season: making due as best they can until help from the farm system arrives.
With about 220 stores and 1.5 million square feet of space, Woodbridge Center is the third-largest shopping mall in New Jersey, behind only Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus and Freehold Raceway Mall. The mall is located just off Route 1, in the shadows of the Garden State Parkway.
Lesniak, however, is not ruling out the measure’s chances for passage.
Military leaders agree that we must address our economic security as the foundation of our national security. Adm. Michael Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has noted that "the most significant threat to our national security is our debt." With that in mind, this is a time for tough decisions on both sides of the aisle, not a time to protect unwanted programs.
The Clippers held a 2-1 edge over the Grizzlies during the regular season, winning both games played at Staples Center, but losing April 9 at Memphis, 94-85, after falling behind by 12 in the first two quarters.

Many dictionaries define God as the creator of the world and is omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent and benevolent. In other words, God knows everything, is everywhere, can do everything, and wants to be good to all of creation. This is the model of God that atheists are always attacking. It is also the definition of God that many of our readers follow. If you believe this describes God please go to the online poll and vote for Option 1: I believe that God is the creator and is omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent and benevolent.
TRENTON — It started with a party invitation to a 15-year-old girl from some young men she knew. She took her 7-year-old stepsister to an apartment down the street from their home near the New Jersey Statehouse, where the girls had been hanging around outside on a Sunday afternoon.
Nonetheless, what Malloy did was historic, and it was a sign that despite the dreary polarization that characterizes our debates, American politics is still capable of springing surprises.
"It was not an easy decision, and I know my vote will be widely criticized, but I believe it is the right thing to do," Mr. Durbin wrote in an op-ed in Friday's Chicago Tribune. "The simple fact is this: America needs to grow our economy and reduce our $13.8 trillion debt."
Children tore across the beach and settled in to make sandcastles, oblivious to the cool misty air. Joggers, cyclists and dogs shared the path. The bay was a calm silvery blue, Alcatraz a still life in beige, and the Golden Gate Bridge muted by the morning fog.
Sales of the iPhone don’t boost the results of a cellphone company immediately, because the companies subsidize them so they sell for $99 or $199. They count on making the money back in service fees over two-year contracts.
For the last three months of the year, the Paris-based group posted organic revenue growth—a key metric in the advertising industry that strips out acquisitions, disposals and currency effects—of 12.5%, almost twice what analysts had expected for the quarter, and a level Publicis hasn't seen since the dot-com boom in the 1990s.
"There's a common claim, made all the time, that politics stops at the water's end or that politics should stop at the water's edge. That may be an aspiration. It's never been a reality," said James Lindsay, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Yes, the same Darby Trotter. He is head of Kansas City River Trails. The organization employs donated money, in-kind services and federal dollars to develop the Riverfront Heritage Trail system and facilitates construction by the Unified Government, the city of Kansas City and the Port Authority.
She stopped worrying about timid diners - and even more wisely, sidestepped the hipsterdom (Canary Islands! Andrea Calek!) that hobbles many small lists in favor of unexpected discoveries, little-known Austrian reds like the 2004 Brundlmayer St. Laurent or the 2006 Ultraviolet red from Violet-Green, a tiny label in Humboldt County.
Parents also should carefully choose the location of their set, Nazario said. She recommends shady areas where the ground is level and there are no low-hanging branches or wires.

Greene, who started at second base over the weekend in Milwaukee, receives his second start of the season -- only this time it's at shortstop, his original position.
Fenner ruled that only the child victims of Ratigan’s alleged conduct are eligible to collect damages under federal law.
That the state shut down Imagine Schools Inc. is a very good thing. The company's leadership clearly was more interested in making money than in improving public education in St. Louis. The schools, meant as an alternative to the unaccredited public schools, actually performed worse than almost any schools, public or charter, in the state.
"I don't know why people like that go out to do that to people, to single someone out and attack them for no reason," said the student, who called police after the alleged attack and was taken in an ambulance to Advocate BroMenn Medical Center in Normal.
Letter writer Cindy Schild, a spokeswoman for the American Petroleum Institute, claims the Keystone XL pipeline to bring crude oil from Canada is needed to create jobs ("Keystone XL pipeline is a step toward the future", Aug. 22). Environmental effects aside, this misses the larger point.
Moeller said the signing was a "pretty exciting" step in the process to build the bridge. He is satisfied with how the bill turned out when it passed the Legislature. Tolling I-205 wasn't a serious option among proponents, he said, but the bill puts any concern about that to rest by prohibiting it from happening.

The Knights went 5-of-6 at the line after that to seal the win and prolong the season.
Many experts say the longer Congress waits to address the two programs, the more difficult it could become to impose adequate changes. If Congress acts soon, it can phase in changes over time, perhaps sparing current retirees while giving those closing in on retirement time to prepare.
The prosecutor's office declined to comment. But the development agreement the county signed in April says the county or MMPI will handle site acquisition.
Jonathan Bullar of Maryland Heights was killed on his third jump on Oct. 9 at Archway Skydiving Center, based at Vandalia Municipal Airport, about 65 miles northeast of St. Louis. Bullar had jumped eight or nine times prior to that day.

Few people might use the word segregation in describing the state of schools in New Jersey.
"Kain has had a really good spring, and he's done a great job leading the offense," Fitzgerald said. "Maybe today's snapshot might not be his best practice of the spring, but he's done a really good job throughout."

"Customer service is nonexistent," said Wang, who is now booking flights on other airlines, including the one he took to London this week. "They are like a 9-to-5 operation in a 24/7 world."
Former Edwards aide Christina Reynolds was testifying about an argument Elizabeth Edwards had with her husband on the day in October 2007 that a tabloid published a story about his affair with Rielle Hunter. As Reynolds was beginning the account about what happened at the Raleigh airport, Edwards turned to his daughter Cate, who was seated in the front row.
Along those lines, Thompson also steers clear of bottled, reconstituted lemon juice.

“Very smart,” Girardi said. "You can say he's a very good player. But he's also a very heads up player as well. He'll take advantage if you fall asleep on him. He's a great hitter, so I mean it's a bat to be reckoned with.”
øThe Jatropha plant is sort of like hemp. Growing it allows these poor farmers to take what was unusable land and turn it into a profit center. Said the smart and affable Garton, "We help Indian farmers harness the worst quality land to produce a product that can be manufactured into jet fuel, biodiesel, and electricity at 50% less than the prevailing crude oil price."
The inspiration for the rap, “N****s in Paris,” also happens to be the inspiration for Terrell Suggs' Ball So Hard University.

Old people.
“He was efficient and he would pull no punches,” Azzinaro added. “He would say this is what’s wrong and this is what’s going to have to be done. And he was fast; he had it back to you within hours, unlike some places that keep your car for three days.”
"We were able to erase a couple of leads and stayed in the game. I wish we could have kept that pace up that we had in the first period," said Parise. "We didn't really give them much room out there, but I thought we played a pretty solid game all around."
There are other things. Which is the point. But there are times when it seems like there aren't other things. Times when it seems the only thing is to respond to emails and calls that are coming in fast and furious on the computers in our pockets. Times when it seems we've been granted a magic moment of free time, so why not use it to tweet our dinner plans or scan Facebook or check-in on Foursquare, so others with free moments and computers in their pockets can pull them out and follow our every move?
Bob Werb is the chairman of the board of the Space Frontier Foundation, an organization of people dedicated to opening the space frontier to human settlement. Their goals include protecting Earth's fragile biosphere and creating a freer and more prosperous life for each generation by using the unlimited energy and material resources of space.
With the turbo attached, the engine makes a robust 265 horsepower and 258 lb.-ft. of torque. Interestingly, this is even more powerful than the larger 3.6-liter six cylinder, which makes 256 ponies and 247 lb.-ft. of torque (though the naturally aspirated engines can drink 87-octane gas, while the turbo one requires premium fuel).
Of course, Lautner still has only one expression — surly incomprehension. (If a thought ever crossed his mind, it would have to pack a lunch.) But Robert Pattinson has a couple of good scenes, and Kristen Stewart fully commits to looking awful as a pregnant mom. (You can imagine the anti-glam actress demanding they make her look worse.)
If the race would have resumed he would have had to come back to the pits to get his car fixed and most assuredly cost him his 10th-place finish.
Democrats assailed the cuts, saying Republicans were targeting the poor while boosting the Pentagon budget above levels agreed to last summer.
While Mahoney often uses the brighter-hued abalone shells from New Zealand, where they're known by the Maori name paua, or from Mendocino, she finds the softer hues of Monterey abalone work well paired with local icons, such as a cypress tree she recently made of silver. As a background, the shell "does look like the pale, foggy sunset of the Monterey Bay," Mahoney notes. "It's really the colors of the peninsula."
The men dissolved their business partnership around the time Lewis' band, Huey Lewis and the News, hit it big in the 1980s.
Brown thanked fans for standing by him.
Here are some recommendations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration:
About thousands of personal victories: Jason Stevens of Powell, Ohio, celebrated his half-marathon with a simple fist pump and a "Yes!" He'd run about 10 half-marathons, but never broke 1:40. Until Sunday.

Folks in the city of 13,000 love Jim, a black and white Llewellin English setter who died in 1937 at the age of 12 - but not before becoming a Depression-era sensation. Marshall built a park off the town square to honor Jim. The dog is the only animal buried in the Ridge Park Cemetery.

“I've been in this same spot (114 Brunswick Street) selling records since 1996 and this is the most dynamic, interesting time to be in the business---even in the face of changing technology, downloading, record labels going bust, financial meltdowns, and all the rest of it,” he says. Gritzan heartily embraces Record Store Day and everything it stands for. He just doesn’t plan to open his store earlier than usual.
"It was good. These are the skates I'm going to have to be doing for the next little while to get back, especially at this time of year," Zajac said.
A profile of Beckman in a British publication called FX-MM, said he had a "long and illustrious career," and cited the Morningstar ranking as evidence of his acumen. Beckman links to that article on his website.
A portrait of former Atlanta Mayor Maynard H. Jackson, for whom the terminal is named, hangs in the check-in area, but much of the rest of the art is large-scale hanging pieces or walls that are themselves art.
I would just tell the teacher that you are concerned enough about the language that you are planning to talk to the principal. If this is happening on the playground, it might be best to talk to the principal anyway. When very young children talk about sex with very explicit details, it can be a sign of abuse. It could also be a case of older siblings thinking it is funny to share the terms, so there may be nothing to worry about, but it should still stop. This is something the school should investigate. If the teacher was unable to make the inappropriate language stop, perhaps the principal will have better luck.
The one negative was Kent's special teams, which missed one field goal and had another blocked in the scoreless first half.
Not to miss: An artfully composed beet tartare on a bed of cashew cheese; a mushroom pâté that gets richness from white truffles and nuts; homemade ravioli stuffed with forest mushrooms and tossed in a basil-walnut pesto; spicy gnocchi with roasted fennel, hot peppers and a rich tomato sauce; rum-soaked tiramisu made with plant-based mascarpone.
The Danish violinist Nikolaj Znaider proved an ideal collaborator as he also sounded intent on exploring rather than exploiting Beethoven. He couldn't resist a little virtuosity for virtuosity's sake in the first movement cadenza, but then again, it was a joy to hear the cadenza's open fifth double stops ring out with such resonance and clarity.
The data signals that while consumers still aren’t thrilled about their prospects for the future – an unexpectedly gloomy outlook during the spring season, analysts said – their views of their current situation are perking up a bit.
But in a concession to the oil industry, companies will have to reveal the composition of fluids only after they have completed drilling, not before. The government's original proposal would have required disclosure of the chemicals 30 days before a well could be started.
Like Reutter, Gehring was a member of the 2010 Olympic team and earned a bronze in the relay event. Since then, she said, she has made "huge improvements," including fourth overall in the World Cup standings at 1,000 meters.

Tuesday's incident was the latest in a string of shootings in the suburb north of Minneapolis. Earlier this month, DeLois Brown and her elderly parents were shot to death at Brown's home day care. No arrests have been made.
As for the plight of the country, she says, "America has to come together as an America maybe for the first time ever. I have seen the middle class slowly but surely in the greatest country in the world totally disappearing. There is a highway into poverty and there is not even a sidewalk to get out.

At 6-feet-4, Andrew Douglas would make a nice-sized middle hitter for most area boys squads.
Q. Parenting seems part-art and part-science. How do I know if I'm doing it right?
The Reds shored up their biggest weakness (i.e. pitching) and have fewer variables than the Cardinals heading into the season. I see them as being at least as strong as the Cards on paper. The Brewers return their excellent rotation intact and still have a lot of offensive weapons – if not for Ryan Braun's 50-game suspension, I'd rank the Brewers about even with the Cards and Reds.
Dec. 9 San Diego, 1:00
Three men in Massachusetts and Maine suspected of supplying money to Shahzad have been detained on immigration charges; one was recently transferred to New York.
"The appraisers seem to be hedging for continued decline," said Paul Traub, business economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's Detroit branch. "At some point, we have to start saying the land is worth something."
The warm biscuits (from Pillsbury) and homemade sausage gravy (half order $3.50, full $4.25) are grandma good. The rumpled blanket of thick flavorful sauce suggests a beginning in a nicely cooked roux and a half order is plenty.
The move comes as Southie is embroiled in an escalating prescription pill and heroin problem that many lawmakers — including U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch — have called a “crisis.” The situation boiled over last month when a reputed drug addict was charged with slitting the throat of a grandmother in an opiate-fueled break-in.
A Gilbert man was arrested after breaking his wife's jaw and sinus cavity bone, Gilbert police said.
Drew Miller and Danny Cleary finished the game with Pavel Datsyuk.
Three shows that left too soon: "Party Down," "Better Off Ted," "Teach: Tony Danza."
In recent years, legislators have cut programs to prevent child abuse and underfunded others meant to keep kids healthy. They have turned away money for the disabled — and even hospice funding meant to comfort children during the final days.
At that time, owning a museum was the rage. Big egos had big needs, and they competed for the biggest memorial to their successes, which they imagined everyone should and would honor eternally. Some moderated this hubris with the progressive idea to give something back to the masses who built the railroads and factories that made the rich rich. The ruling elite had abiding faith in old paintings, antiques and books to lift public taste and refinement. Added to these motivations was an aggressive search to finesse inconvenient new taxes through seemingly philanthropic gestures.
Sheyman raised nearly $433,000, none of it self-financed. Tree, meanwhile, had raised slightly more than $100,000 and Bavda just half of that.
While the original Democratic plan was to hire a professional signature collection firm, Ohio Democratic Party officials have gone the all-volunteer route after funding for the effort has not materialized.
"In most situations, this distance would not need an appeal and the rule would be enforceable," DePrez believes.

Losses in the Northwest haven't been as severe, but Oregon farmers are concerned because they use thousands of hives each year to pollinate crops ranging from apples, berries and pears to alfalfa and meadowfoam. Blueberry farmers alone require about 25,000 hives during a short spring pollination period.
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet played down contagion fears after the bank left interest rates unchanged at 1 percent. "Portugal and Greece are not on the same boat, and this is very visible when you look at the facts and figures," he told reporters after the rate decision in Lisbon. "Portugal is not Greece. Spain is not Greece."

Next up is Arizona. The Wildcats and Beavers met just once this season - an 81-73 overtime victory for Arizona in Tucson. That came on the heels of the Beavers' quadruple-overtime loss to Stanford and threatened to emotionally derail the team.
MasterCard earlier this year proposed an idea to ad executives to link Internet users to information about actual purchase behaviors for ad targeting, according to a MasterCard document and executives at some of the world's largest ad companies who were involved in the talks. "You are what you buy," the MasterCard document says.
Secondly, it was a trap: If the bishops had agreed to live the lie that the church would not be paying for something it opposes on doctrinal grounds, it would have been perfectly logical for the federal government to wipe out the exemptions the HHS rules give to Catholic churches themselves and to the relatively few church institutions that engage solely in religious activities. If the insurance companies are paying for it -- wink, wink -- then why not just go ahead and make "free" contraceptives available to the pastoral minister, the organist and the catechist?
"The first few weeks were kinda harried," said Mary Migalla, who taught at Holy Rosary and moved to Caseyville elementary in Collinsville this fall. "But I think I've found where I want to be. I love these kids."
Sometimes you don't want to know what is lurking in the dark because the answer is just too obvious and dumb.
—Change is raising fuel-efficiency standards for cars.
This is a coach who successfully transitioned from Lyle Moevao to Sean Canfield in recent seasons. He's a guy who has dealt effectively with poor-play stretches from prior quarterbacks Matt Moore and Derek Anderson. Riley does a wonderful job managing his quarterbacks, and it's part of the reason why he attracts NFL-caliber talent at that position.
He remembers a grizzly bear he and his father saw at the zoo; he knows that bear has something to do with his father's death and something to do with his young life. The 800-pound bear, in the meantime, has escaped from a cargo boat in the North Atlantic and swum to shore. It lives in a cave in the Outer Hebrides.
"Prison is a terrible place, and to put someone there for a lifetime is essentially to take their life," Talley added. "You better make damn well sure that someday when the ceremony of your career is over, and you're just some old guy looking in the mirror, that the answer to that last question is an emphatic 'yes.'"
And then, your second impression is confirmed by a co-conspirator:
Brett Hundley as UCLA's starting quarterback is a decision that may be in the near future.

"The problem with the note," she wrote on her blog, "is that it's representative of the bigger privacy intrusions that the U.S. government, through the TSA and other sources, levels every day."
“Passion Play,” a laughable mess of a fantasy, features Rourke as an ex-junkie jazzman playing in a strip club. Never mind that strip clubs haven’t had live bands since, oh, the days of Blaze Starr. (But do notice — spoiler alert! — that the club is called the Dream Lounge.)
"Part of the challenge is most people have a hard time going back a day or two in their minds," he said. "I can fully understand the frustration and resoluteness, both on the part of law enforcement. They're still looking for the proverbial human straw in a haystack."
Kids and adults alike enjoyed spring weather and plenty of activities to choose from -- pony rides, a petting zoo, bounce houses and a candy hunt.

At 10 a.m., Republican senators huddled in caucus while Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester) met with Christie. After he left, Republican minority leaders from both houses entered the governor's office.
That’s true. However, Oregon’s mix of companies has changed. Many companies are now partnerships or organized as the type of corporation that distributes earnings to the owners, who then pay personal income taxes.
Sinovic and Besler provide a calm presence in the back. Neither gets rattled easily and both are strong on the ball and in one-on-one situations.

The Rev. Delono Straham told 9News that his mother was the second fatality.
The U.S. unemployment rate has fallen a full percentage point since August to 8.1 percent last month — the lowest level since January 2009. Hiring has strengthened, despite posting weaker-than-anticipated gains in March and April. And the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first quarter, aided by stronger consumer spending.
The director squeezes in a lot of the book, but "Marigold Hotel" sugarcoats the poverty and scrimps on the sightseeing. Even India's obnoxious outsourced call centers get a makeover. Still, it all works out in the end, and that makes this charmer that rare movie that treats old age as more than tragic or cute. It never condescends to its characters or shortchanges its intended AARP-discount audience.
The researchers examined 2009 data that hospitals were required to submit to the state on 19,368 patients with appendicitis. To get the fairest comparisons, the researchers included only uncomplicated cases with hospital stays of less than four days. Patients were 18 to 59 years old.
Last year, a large contingent of Timbers Army folks went up into the Coastal Range to help cut wood for a disadvantaged man to help keep him supplied throughout the year. It was then, when I actually saw Timber Joey wielding an axe, and showing others how to actually chop wood, that I realized these men aren't just some regular old Joes from off the street playing up as the "Timbers Mascot."

Infiniti says it will unveil an M35hL sedan designed for Chinese businesspeople and government officials with an extended backseat and a gas-electric hybrid engine.
This year, opening day for Major League baseball collides with the Christian observance of Holy Week. Both guide us into a new season of belief and trust, though Holy Week certainly requires more of us than sitting in the stands.
And why is the GOP so devoted to these doctrines regardless of facts and evidence? It surely has a lot to do with the fact that billionaires have always loved the doctrines in question, which offer a rationale for policies that serve their interests. Indeed, support from billionaires has always been the main thing keeping those charlatans and cranks in business. And now the same people effectively own a whole political party.

Rock has taught us love stinks and love hurts, but Jack White ups the ante on his single “Love Interruption,” from his upcoming CD, “Blunderbuss,” due April 24. The neo-bluesman is calm as he sings to the simple, slow-burn piano/guitar/sax arrangement. He croons, “I want love to roll me over slowly. Stick a knife inside me and twist it all around.” White broods his way through the piece — he wants love to hurt him, kill his mother and turn his friends into enemies. He gets vocal support from Ghanaian singer Ruby Amanfu, who appeared with him this past weekend to perform the track on “Saturday Night Live.” While it’s still a creepy song, the pair’s angel/devil balance of voices helps establish the tune’s twisted sense of romance.

2007-10-02 13:09:14.0 Brian Kamenetzky: theishy- I think guys were annoyed by it, sure. It's hard not to be a little insulted by all of that went on. And while this will hang over their head as a team this year (adn possibly next) there's not a whole lot that can be done. Everyone agreed, or at least said to the media, that this isn't something they'll sit down and hash out as a team. And I certainly wouldn't worry about a Luke/Kobe rift- those guys both play hard, and do what they can to win. But how Kobe leads will be an issue, for sure. He'll have to do some fence mending, even if it doesn't include face to face apologies or similar.

Sow statice after the last frost along with your heat-loving veggies and flowers. As your plants mature, they produce many stems, each topped with a group of flowers. It's best to cut them in the morning after the dew has dried. Select stems just as the buds open to keep them from maturing any further. When these slightly immature blooms dry fully, they will open just a bit more, then are frozen in time at their peak. The longer statice flowers stay in the sun, the more faded they become, so this early picking is key to maximizing color in the cut materials.

I never knew Steve when he was first at Apple. I wasn't covering technology then. And I only met him once between his stints at the company.

Conley said Payne, a Connecticut native who was living off campus with roommates, didn’t know Smith and did nothing to bring about her death.
There are a subset of fans that will say, “this beef is fabricated ... it has to be a work.” I don't blame these people, as pro wrestling fans are conditioned to believe nothing of what they hear and half of what they see. However, I believe the interaction to be genuine because Chris Brown doesn't have much to gain from this interaction, other than his own amusement, which seems to be the case. Based on his tweets, he clearly is a former pro wrestling fan and may find it interesting to tweet with the current WWE Champion, despite it being born out of disgust at his past actions. CM Punk's Twitvid on the subject was from the heart and very well delivered. In the end if it is revealed to be a fabrication, then well done. CM Punk doesn't seem like the type of guy that will care much about any of the above statistics, rather simply being happy to be able to speak his mind, in this case to Chris Brown and reminding people why he doesn't like him.

I like to come up here in the summer and watch football practice. I’ll meet the kids there or find them in the weight room. I’ll look them up and down and say, "Come on out for the lacrosse team." The first year was tough. We had 12 players come out and they acted like I was asking them to come out for the chess team. The first kid I got that turned things around at City was Ellis Foster. He was a stud football player. His father and I worked together, so every day I would ask: "Is Ellis going to play, Is Ellis going to play?" I knew if I got Ellis, I would be able to get other football players out and that’s what happened.

øIt bumped up the fuel-economy ratings by one or two miles per gallon, taking the combined city/highway numbers out of the high teens to 20 mpg (all-wheel drive) and 21 (front-wheel drive). But the boost isn't glaringly evident in real-world driving, which yields midteens, just as in most similar vehicles. It's reassuring to have better mileage on the window-sticker, but not a compelling real-life selling point.

Based on that, the council majority (Kelly Boyd voted no) voted for a stop-work order. The council made clear it doesn't think the owners are, in the words of Mayor Jane Egly, "the devil incarnate." The city staff is to reassess the permit. Christoph wants a strict application of a city code that requires demolition be reviewed by the city Heritage Commission and that approvals be in compliance with California Environmental Quality Act strictures on preservation.

Hey, Steve: I would give up the two No. 1s this year and one next year for Luck. Now, that doesn't mean instant success his rookie season.

The same logic also applies here to bonds, because at year-end the top tax rate on interest income will rise to 43.4% from 35%. According to our simple arithmetic, if the yield on a 10-year Treasury is 2% today, it would rise to 2.3% with next year's tax rates. That's a whole new version of the Laffer Curve, one in which higher taxes drive higher government debt service costs.

A: I like to leave a cookie trail to the right answer. I find sometimes you can bring a horse to water but you can't always get it to drink. But I don't like to say, 'Look, this is how we should do it.' I like to provide some approach that helps the team that's thinking about the problem get to that answer. And when they get there, I might say something like, 'That's terrific. I was hoping you'd end up there. What a great solution.' It's hard, though, when the team doesn't get to where you want it go to. And then you have a difficult decision to make. Do you enforce your will or do you let the team learn from their approach?
