* Northwestern has this two-point loss to No. 10 Ohio State, and the Wildcats lost twice in overtime to No. 13 Michigan. At 17-12 and 7-10 in Big Ten play, the Wildcats remain on the bubble to earn the first NCAA bid in school history but they probably need one more solid win, something more than just beating Iowa in the season finale or beating a team like Illinois or Minnesota in an opening-round Big Ten Tournament game.

Supporters of the bill say the state needs to cut costs because the pension and health systems are underfunded by more than $120 billion total.

He’s got a great first step off the ball and can jump enough to be a factor when there’s a live ball.

It's in the 110-seat main dining room where Humphrey cooks for the most willing of audiences. When I reviewed the restaurant in July 2008, I was impressed with Humphrey's talent. One particularly memorable dish, for example, was a trio of eggs and seafood - a pheasant egg topped with caviar and Parmesan foam, a partridge egg with salmon roe, and a fried quail egg draped over sea urchin roe. That and other dishes led to a 3 1/2-star rating for food.

"The Cabin in the Woods" also appealed mostly to men and i played best with an older crowd, 65% of whom were older than 25 — not the typical audience for a horror film. But those moviegoers didn't care for the film, giving it an average C grade. Many critics were enamored by the horror movie, indicating that the marketing campaign may have led fans to believe the film would be different than the one they got in theaters.

Cabrera popped up from his gymnastics routine with a huge smile on his face and the Tigers TV announcers were laughing right along with him as the crowd gave him a standing ovation. Then when he whiffed on the grounder, the smiles continued for the new third baseman. Sorry if I dont find the humor. This isnt some grade school fair where you get a participant ribbon just for trying. This is the bigs. And almost every other third baseman in the game (Yes, even Brandon Inge) makes both of those plays with no fanfare. But since Cabrera isnt supposed to make those plays and didnt make one of the plays, it becomes comic fodder. Sorry, Im not amused. Im fine with Cabrera playing third and support the move even if he continues to struggle down there. But I dont think we should make light of the situation. One caller to 97.1 The Ticket made the point that Cabreras error probably hastened Verlanders exit after eight innings because it added to the pitch count. He makes a very valid argument.

Our version goes something like this: This is the dishwasher that spilled on the floor, that needed repair, and now there is more; this is the counter top with scratches and mold, that when replaced, makes the cabinets look old. So they get refinished and it all looks so new, but then the family room needs a redo, and this is the sofa that's saggy and faded, so let's get a new one, reclining and sueded! But look at those walls - the wallpaper's unsightly, so let's tear it off and paint the walls brightly; but with the new paint a new rug we must get, and before long, cha-ching, we have gone into debt.

øInvestors who rush to file their returns might face having to file an amended return if their brokers make any changes to the 1099-B. Investors who in January bought shares of a stock they sold for a loss in 2011 might get an amended 1099-form that disallows that loss as a so-called "wash sale," says Cameron Routh at Scivantage. That's because brokers must notify the IRS when losses are disqualified if the shareholder buys back the losing stock in 30 days or less. Other corrections, too, might be more likely if there's any effect on cost basis, he says.

Allan Muir, SI.com: "It was the sort of play that, sadly, has come to define the career of Torres, a player once so highly regarded that he was drafted fifth overall in 2000. Now? Forget slap shots. Cheap shots are his specialty, as the heads of Jordan Eberle, Jan Hejda, Nate Prosser, Andrew Ference and perhaps most famously, Brent Seabrook, can attest. The latest blow he inflicted was as nasty as any of those. You can argue it was only borderline late -- and no doubt, his supporters in Phoenix will engage in all sorts of moral relativism as they do just that. What you can't argue is that he traveled a great distance and launched himself off the ice before contact with an opponent who was completely vulnerable."

Lots of comments are based on lack of knowledge. Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf is not from Saudi Arabia or being financed by the Saudi government. Imam Rauf follows mostly Sufism (mystical spiritualism). "If we can not build churches or synagogues in Muslim countries why should a mosque be built". Only Muslim country I know which does not allow the construction of churches or synagogues is Saudi Arabia, rest of the Muslim countries have churches, synagogues, Hindu temples depending upon the people of faith living in the country. It might surprise some that Iran has synagogues and Jews still attend it. I strongly believe that if we as Americans claim to have the freedom of religion and beacon of light for the world then we should set our own examples according to our constitution and traditions.

* I'll hit more Blues' stuff tomorrow, but it was great to see Andy McDonald return to the lineup after an extended absence. And he made a difference right away, with an assist in the Blues' dominant 3-0 win over San Jose. McDonald's speed is an ideal fit for Ken Hitchcock's aggressive end-to-end style ...

It's true that the latest New York Times/CBS News poll finds the president's approval rating falling to 41 percent and that his campaign is worried about fund-raising.

Gov. Walker likes to criticize the business climate in Illinois, though Wisconsin's private-sector job growth ranks 36th in the nation, according to the BLS, and lags far behind its midwestern neighbors, including Illinois.
“Working with any director — you enter into this sort of marriage for six, seven months,” DiCaprio says. “Starting with someone new, you have to learn what their boundaries are, what their abilities are — it’s a process. So working with a director again and again, where you have so many shared references to draw from, so many past mistakes and triumphs to refer to, that’s a big, big advantage. I remember, working on the screening-room scene in ‘The Aviator,’ Marty saying to me, ‘You’re going to have to go someplace emotionally here that’ll surprise the both of us’ — well, that kind of connection, that kind of trust is invaluable.”
Community leaders realize that high unemployment and a weak economy may affect the vote. But they hope voters will see the fire district's efforts as an earnest turn-around and a down payment on lasting trust.

The remembrance of the 150th anniversary of the first shots of the Civil War at Ft. Sumter, S.C., underway until April 17 will give rise to a host of reenactments throughout the nation until 2015, although you're unlikely to see one on a National Park Service battlefield. That's because policy usually prohibits battle reenactments on NPS land, so the redux will more than likely be on a nearby field.
In the U.S., a drop in an index of Midwestern manufacturing and a slowdown in consumer spending last month added to worries that the economy is losing steam.
Defense is what Mike Brown brought to this team and this town when he was hired to be the Lakers coach. It’s not an easy sell. L.A. isn’t a defense kind of town. Defense doesn’t twinkle or titillate. Defense generally is as sexy as Santa Claus.

The kitchen is at its best when preparing fish and seafood but does nice work with meats and is especially respectful of the veggies. Plate presentations are bold, but subtlety shows up in his light touch at seasoning: a whisper of thyme in wonderful French onion soup, a hint of pepper in a creamy, meaty cassoulet, the surprising play of anchovy butter over a plush, tender, succulently juicy swordfish fillet. Out front of the building, a small marquee announces: "Food. Art. Joy." Sure enough, here's a place where you can let down your hair, have some fun and dig into really, really good chow.

Halley continues to speak gibberish, like the many politicians who send their pre-recorded, computerized campaign calls through our phone lines at dinner time. What the caller ID readout says on the phone is nowhere near what Halley intones. For example, there is some entity named AICR trying to call us frequently. Halley says it's "acre" calling. "Charity Clothing" becomes, in Halley-speech, something like "chertyclithng." You can imagine that some abbreviations can become quite… suggestive.

Max Baucus' office at 3 a.m., after Wyden's amendment to the health care bill was ruled out of order. Wyden was fuming that he'd been double-crossed.

Black Americans have spoken out against racial profiling by police. They've been insulted by store personnel who might give them extra scrutiny. There's the insult of the sound of a car door being locked when a black approaches. It's insulting to have taxi drivers pass up a black person and pick up white people down the street. In a similar vein, I'm sure that a law-abiding Muslim is insulted when given extra scrutiny at airports or listening to Fox News reporter Juan Williams, who was fired by National Public Radio in 2010 for publicly saying that he gets nervous when he sees people on a plane with clothing that identifies them as Muslim. Blacks and Muslims who face the insults of being profiled might direct their anger toward those who've made blacks and crime synonymous and terrorism and Muslims synonymous.

That being said, I also agree with E.J. Singler, who said yesterday that he thinks the Pac-12 is consistently undervalued on a national scale. In my opinion, that is more a matter of geography than anything; it is widely accepted that college basketball is better back east than on the west coast. Some days I think that perception is spot on, other days not so much. I guess we'll all just have to wait until the NCAA tournament to see if it's true this year. For the record, I predict three Pac-12 teams will head to March Madness. How about you?

I've been thinking about consumer expectations since last week, when I wrote about the man-made soles of five pairs of shoes that, over the past several years, have turned gooey, or suddenly delaminated, or cracked and begun to crumble, or totally disintegrated over a period of hours. It isn't just me, either. At lunch the other day, an old friend was telling me about a pair of Clarks walking shoes that had seemed perfectly fine when he put them on one morning. A little while later he noticed that chunks of the sole material were falling off. By the end of the day, his shoes had no soles at all.

Alex Hassell is a solid wannabe-menacing Mick, the leather-jacketed younger brother who owns the house - skulking in the background, popping up unexpectedly and generally intimidating the newcomer, when he's not bonding with him. His interrogation of Davies is one of the show's highlights, as is his deliciously detailed interior-decoration aria. He also sparks a very funny baggage-keep-away routine that plays like Pinter's nod to the vaudeville shtick of his mentor Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot."

McClendon apologized to investors this week for "distractions" in his financial dealings. He also questioned the veracity of some of the news reports.
Maryland's transportation infrastructure must be financially supported. However, when dollars are tight it begs the question, "Are we getting the most bang for our buck?" Most of Maryland's transportation money comes from road users in the form of fuel taxes and vehicle excise taxes, yet 57 percent of the Maryland Department of Transportation's annual operating expenses go to support the state's transit systems. Car and truck drivers raise over $1.9 billion of the state's transportation income, while costing only $1.25 billion. This means $650 million is donated by highway users to subsidize our transit systems. Failing to invest in transit is a mistake, yet so is over-investing. Total transit ridership is 4 percent of commuters. Since 1980, Maryland has spent billions on transit projects, yet the rate of commuters using the systems to get to work is virtually the same. Absent a new supplemental source of transit funding, Maryland's Transportation Trust Fund will collapse under the growing weight of our transit costs. No amount of gas tax increase will be able to support the massive transit investments that the Red Line and Purple Line will require.

Nevada's problem is that it's joined at the hip to California. The resort- and entertainment-rich Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas depend on tourist trade from the Golden State—and there, the economy remains depressed. Between 2000 and 2011, California lost nearly 1.7 million people to domestic migration. California's high cost of living seems likely to discourage new residents from moving to the state, and, left unreformed, its out-of-whack finances, poor business climate, and anemic job creation in the largest metropolitan areas will probably complicate any return to its former growth. The Sunshine State has ousted the Golden State as the place for optimists to watch.
