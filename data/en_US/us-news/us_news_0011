I think Samardzija was just trying to be honest, and he subsequently admitted he talked a big game about being a starter and didn't want to "look like an idiot." I'd rather a player say something interesting than repeat the old company line of "whatever is best for the team." As far as hubris consultant, I believe that's part of the psychologist's job. And he's doing a great job, by the way.

We live and do business in the information age, but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black and white TV. There are twelve different agencies that deal with exports. There are at least five different entities that deal with housing policy. Then there’s my favorite example: the Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they’re in fresh water, but the Commerce Department handles them in when they’re in saltwater. And I hear it gets even more complicated once they’re smoked.
"We are a nation, after all, under law and the president has confidence in the head of the Secret Service, as do I," Romney said.

Almost 30 years ago, former Bee columnist Joe Hamelin insisted an NBA team was coming to Sacramento. As an NBA beat writer in San Diego at the time, I said he was crazy. I couldn't imagine a team up here. Now, as a 15-year resident  as someone who has experienced this small-market phenomenon known as the Kings  I couldn't imagine Sacramento without the Kings.
Another provision that could affect all federal employees allows the Postal Service to set up its own employee health insurance plan and withdraw from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.

Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, may have undermined the push by postal officials to do that with his amendment, which would require any new postal program to have the same quality as the current government-wide program.

Altman said that while the makeup of the Sun Devils might be different, he believes team concepts will stay the same, so preparation for Thursday’s game shouldn’t change.
So I write about them, searching out the meanings and the understanding of it all. That's where you come in. I've learned much from reading your writing, whether we've agreed or agreed to disagree. And I plan to keep learning. In the Christian tradition, there's a classic Latin phrase that I think sums up what I'm trying to do: fides quaerens intellectum. Faith seeking understanding.

"Normally, we do the Windy City Tournament in Chicago, but they're not having the tournament this year, so our first experience playing anybody from Illinois will be in the state finals.

While Umrigar's stories may be about her and her family, they help reveal the absurdities of a nation in transition from colonialism.

18. Mike Haridopolos, state Senate president (Last year: 16th). The Brevard County Republican carries a lot of clout as dean of the state Senate. And he'd probably carry even more if he wasn't eclipsed by another Dean … Cannon, the House speaker who ran the legislative show. The future for Haridopolos, 41, depends on how he performs in 2012 — as well as his future plans.

øUnless the rules of capitalism are suspended, eventually, Apple will encounter a rival that's able to take it on. If that happens, using Apple stock as an ATM will cease to work. And that's why your strategy seems to be setting you up for trouble. Remember that Apple stock can correct, especially considering how rapidly it's risen. If there's any disruption in the company's business, a severe downturn in the stock would be expected. And that's why using the stock market for quick gains, traditionally, has not worked out well and is not a good idea.

A: You have to understand from Microsoft's, I think from the guys at Microsoft's perspective, and I would agree, they've had some successes like Connect but they're clearly behind in some key areas that are clearly the key battlegrounds of the future like the phone and the tablet, and so they're coming from behind there, and so they have to do their best to catch up. I'm certainly rooting for them to do better, and they know that, but since they're playing catch-up they've got a heck of a challenge. I try to give them my best advice and I wish them the best, but in technology it's always a challenge to come from behind. Sometimes you can pull it off and sometimes you wind up with a lesser market share than if you'd been earlier into the game. I could go on for hours and hours about particular things, but I'm not sure that this is what you want to talk about ....

In Santa Clara County, where 87,000 acres of mostly undeveloped wilderness were set aside for Henry W. Coe State Park, a three-year agreement was reached between the state and a new nonprofit group, the Coe Park Preservation Fund. Here the landscape alternates between open mountain ridges and steep canyons; grassland and chaparral in scenic hills; and riparian habitats along creeks. The open countryside bursts into wonderful spring wildflower displays, while a combination of live and blue oaks and big berry manzanita provide shade. With its 250 miles of trails and many small lakes, this park is popular with hikers, bikers, backpackers and anglers willing to hike to its remote lakes.

If we can agree that the 1962 Mets were the gold standard (or the zinc standard, perhaps) for ineptitude, there are several candidates for which one comes next. The 103-loss Worst Team Money Could Buy team of 1993 makes a strong case, thanks to their bleach spraying and firecracker slinging. The 2003-04 versions, brightened by Art Howe’s personality lighting up the room, demand a spot in the team photo. As do just about any team from 1963-67, though ’63’s 111-loss team which finished 48 games out of first place (and 15th out of ninth) merits special consideration.

"Burn": This is the story of Detroit firefighters on the front lines of trying to save the city, as observed by directing-producing partners Tom Putnam and Brenna Sanchez (she grew up on Detroit's west side). After pretty much embedding themselves with engine companies, what they found was a group of dedicated public servants -- with the hearts of heroes and the resources of a financially strapped city -- waging a continuous battle and facing a huge arson problem. Helmet cams provided a rare look at what firefighters actually see inside burning structures, while Putnam and Sanchez's interviews delved into how they feel about their difficult job. "Burn" has earned the support of "Rescue Me" star Denis Leary, a firefighter advocate who's come on board as an executive producer.

Caterer Chad Harris' menu is simple, but the ingredients all have a pedigree. The chicken in the Nashville Hot Chicken is from Fulton Valley; the crispy battered wing, thigh and drumstick are piled on a sturdy slice of bread, which helps to soak up the copious amount of grease.

They examined the possibility of bringing him in from the cold via federal law and determined that it would cost more money, take more time, and perhaps also expose their case to public scrutiny. They couldn't evaluate his guilt or innocence based upon any nonpublic relevant information about the Ramsey murder, they said Tuesday in an extraordinary display of honesty, because there isn't any such nonpublic information. It's not their fault this is so. It's the fault of their predecessors in interest in Boulder and elsewhere. The modern-day stewards of the investigation are just trying to make the best of an imperfect situation.

These perceptual perks have real-world benefits. The scientists argue, for instance, that the ability to process vast amounts of data helps to explain the prevalence of savant-like talents among autistic subjects. Some savants perform difficult mathematical calculations in their head, others draw exquisitely detailed pictures at a young age. These skills have long remained a mystery, but they appear to be rooted in a distinct cognitive style shared by all autistics. Because they can process details that elude the rest of us, they can perform tasks that seem impossible, at least for the normal mind.

In front of children, in professional settings and in polite company, most Americans no longer think it is OK to make racist jokes about black people. We recognize that it is both hurtful and inaccurate to judge someone's intentions by their skin color or ethnic origin. But when it comes to Muslims and people from Muslim countries, we lose those same sensibilities. So why do my kind, liberal-minded friends make such comments without realizing the offense they're causing?

The cuts -- which do not include municipal aid or unpaid furloughs of state workers -- are aimed at resolving a $2.2 billion deficit in the current budget created by falling revenue and increased costs for various programs.

Brown's record goes 10 pages. It lists charges that range from heroin and cocaine possession to weapons offenses to a sex offense charge. There's larceny and burglary. There's assault, too. And Brown tells people that's all behind him, that he's reformed now and spends his time counseling gang members and mentoring young African-Americans in how they can be positive influences.
Still, he remains the underdog, so much so that Evans was asked if there was any danger of looking past
I've been testing Calltrunk, a service that records, stores and transcribes calls initiated by its app or website; a manual feature on iPhones and Skype also enables recording incoming calls. It uses landlines, mobile phones or Skype accounts to place calls, and these calls are stored in a password-protected account for $5 to $50 monthly. I also tested Uppidy, a free service that, once installed on an Android phone or BlackBerry, automatically logs all text messages sent to or from that phone in a Web-based account for reading or sorting later.

Ward 3 Councilman Ronald Ely contradicted Matyja on a number of points. Ely admitted, "the city will pay for infrastructure improvements," though he added that such changes "will need to be done eventually anyway." Regarding the port authority bonds, Ely argued, "investors are the ones at risk not us," noting that Wickliffe "will only need to pay the port authority if land values increase." Moreover, Ely stressed, "the bonds will stop if the development does not meet Wickliffe City Code."

The county Republican Party will make endorsements this week.
But other jobs are moving, too.
As the couple works through their issues, Tom and Violet aren't the only ones who are conflicted. At times the film plays like farce — a painful crossbow misfire, an improbable parkour action scene in an Ann Arbor alleyway. At other times, such as when Tom's discontent surfaces, the film shifts to relationship drama in ways that are interesting yet out of sync with the general tone. Cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe ("Vicky Cristina Barcelona") must have had to scramble to keep up with the mood changes and the one-off comic bits that keep turning up.
But if you want to reconnect with the commitment of making something, especially the abstract form rendered with glorious adroitness, then visit Harry Widman's retrospective at the Hallie Ford Museum of Art at Willamette University.

Baffert has earned a reputation for pushing his horses and building to the six-week Triple Crown chase, which has not been successfully navigated since Affirmed did it in 1978. As with pitchers in baseball, there's considerable debate about whether training builds stamina in a colt or saps it. Bodemeister clearly extended himself in Arkansas; there's fear he'll "bounce" and be unable to find the force needed down the stretch.

She moves a little slower than during her run of a record eight national championships during 1987-2008, but on game day, Summitt is still in charge, just as she has been for 1,098 wins after Saturday’s 84-73 victory over Kansas.
Senior Elise Viox, a standout during the cross county season before an injury sidelined her late in the fall, is expected to compete in the 800- and 1,600-meter races and also be a key part of the 3,200-relay team. But that could change as the season goes along.

Credit reporting bureaus sent Asset more than a half-million disputes by consumers in 2008 and 2009. But in many cases, the suit said, Asset's investigation of the disputes consisted of little more than matching the consumer's Social Security number in Asset's file to the Social Security number on the consumer's credit report.

But top-tier performers are facing a much more awkward position than last year. Sympathizing with the writers during their walkout was relatively pain-free because the actors' own economic position was not directly at stake.
Averaging at least four hours a night for 100 nights at her home, he may have cheated taxpayers out of more than 300 hours’ pay, an estimated $25,000 of his annual $175,000 salary, Obenauer said.
Walton, a self-described alcoholic with missing teeth, told the Dreamer he once worked in the mortgage business, making as much as $12,000 a month, before the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and '90s.

The Saws N' Steam: Into the Machine haunted house recycles a theme from last year.
Its whimsical pages may change in scenery, but all have one thing in common: They end with a plea from the narrator for the child listening to “Go the f--- to sleep” (or a similar variation on the sentiment). The expletive in the title and others are sprinkled throughout the book with abandon. One page depicts a snoring heap of lions blissfully at rest. A baby peeks over a sleeping beast’s mane with a dastardly smile.

Fluffy (yes I'm a dude): Here's a stupid question, but how does a network like TNT make any money at all running re-runs of "Law & Order" 23 1/2 hours a day? I have 2 different TNT channels, and that is the only show that's ever on. It was a good show for a time, but come on.
Role model: "For me, Dr. Audrey Odom is a role model because she does everything with passion and enthusiasm. After working under her for the past two years, I see that she is a great example of how if you pursue what you love, you will be successful.

"Ann lived life with a passion, and passed that along to her family," according to a tribute to her life passed out Saturday morning at the West Bowles Community Church, where a "celebration of life" was held.

But I'm not optimistic, and even though the mere thought of buying the flooring and transporting it home and storing it has me paralyzed with fear, in my heart I know that if -- OK, when -- we tackle the project, we'll do it well and we'll do it together and in the end, again, we'll be just a little closer. That, or I'll be living in a run-down apartment on the wrong side of the tracks, subsisting on Top Ramen and Hamburger Helper (minus the hamburger).

øSmith plans to soak up the excitement of the week.
3. Ocean's Eleven (2001): High on the list of those few remakes that are superior to the original. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia and Carl Reiner are perfect casts, and are admirably guided through a taut, clever plan to heist multi-millions from Vegas casinos. So much better than the "Rat Pack" original. It's too bad the two sequels stunk up the joint.

The ruined Top Withins is believed to be the setting for "Wuthering Heights," while Ponden Hall was the model for Thrushcross Grange in the same book. Ferndean Manor in "Jane Eyre" is based on Wycoller Hall in nearby East Lancastershire. Fans flock to Cowan Bridge in the Yorkshire Dales, the inspiration for the dismal Lowood School in "Jane Eyre."
Since 2009 Urdangarin, the princess and their four children have lived in Washington, D.C., where Urdangarin works for the Spanish telecommunications company Telefonica, S.A.
More recently, the ban has become the issue that would not die. The community has voted four times in the past 35 years to uphold the prohibition — but by a narrower margin on each successive occasion. In the most recent referendum, in 1996, the difference was only a few hundred votes.

BEIJING -- General Motors plans to open 600 dealerships in China this year and nearly double the number of cars it builds in China by 2016, with plans to introduce a new Cadillac each year for several years, according to GM executives at the Beijing auto show Monday.
"For some reason, it gave me that sense memory of charoset, that strong honey flavor," Jacobs recalls, and the tipplers' version of a seder staple was born. So Corwin and his husband did what any nice Jewish guys would do next.
"I had done research, and I knew if you were over 6-foot-6 you were not qualified to go kill short people," said Browne, who has a 1969 photo of himself in an Uncle Sam hat towering above a sea of fellow anti-war protesters.

In consecutive sets of songs by Fauré and Chausson, Piau sang with shapely urgency, a combination of fluidity and strength that made the music seem to reach out and gently engage the listener. The lyrical phrases of Fauré's "Après un rêve" ("After a Dream") emerged with sinuous directness, and "Les Heures" ("The Hours"), Chausson's haunting meditation on time and mortality, was superbly rendered.
Diener says people can't smile all the time. "This does not mean that we should not be unhappy when something bad happens, such as losing a love one, but it does mean we should make changes if we are chronically unhappy or if we continue to be very unhappy long after the negative event."
Adding a new type of homeless clients could change the way the problem is tackled and add costs.

The glossy "Thank Me Later" — the prettiest rap album released since the heyday of the Native Tongues — topped the charts upon release in June 2010, but apparently its author wasn’t satisfied with it. Drake is calling his soon-to-be-released follow-up "Take Care," and if that sounds like a note to himself, it is. He felt that he rushed through the recording of "Thank Me Later," and this time around, he’s approaching his set with renewed deliberation. Never mind that "Thank Me Later" maintained its mood and theme better than just about any other 2010 album; Drake feels he can do better, and until he shows us otherwise, it’s best to believe him. It gives us something to get excited about as the days grow shorter.

The Maramottis' largesse has turned Reggio Emilia into an unlikely spot for cutting-edge art and design. Across town, two other artists, Claudio Parmiggiani and Jannis Kounellis, have taken up residence to create works in a Renaissance brick cathedral, while not too long ago, the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava designed and built three futuristic-looking bridges in the region's countryside—en route to Max Mara's headquarters. Luigi, who runs the company with his sister and brother, is modest about how Max Mara jumpstarted all this creative ambition. "Some projects can be carried out better in a small environment."

But as heartening as it is to see black performers recognized, true clout and access to big roles remain the real prizes yet to be won. Yes, there is hardly a character that hasn't at one time or another been played by a black actor — lawyers, doctors, spies, terrorists, even the commander in chief. Some 10 years after complaints that there was no black friend on "Friends," there is a black housewife on "Desperate Housewives." And going only by cop shows and the "Law & Order" franchise, you would think nearly every judge in America is a black woman.

When I moved to this city a little over a year ago, I became fascinated by the stories and photos about 1906. It's compelling because we all know it could happen again.
I support West Ham and Sunderland from the EPL. I had the pleasure of being a guest of the Black Cats fans in 2006 on a Timbers Army trip, and it was a once in a lifetime experience.

Karas reports the triangle developed more or less organically, with each organization arising at different points in the city’s history. The Rescue Mission dates back nearly a century; TASK was established in 1982; and The Salvation Army’s drop-in center opened in the mid-1990s.
Jackson is proud that more than $5 billion in new development is underway in Cleveland, the foundation for a brighter economy. But unless the city can do better to educate students and prepare them to hired for those future jobs, it won't matter much to the mayor.
It all starts with Gascón, whose future here has gone from tenuous to tremendous.

A lot of American space-program enthusiasts are finding hard to swallow the notion that the country that supposedly “won” the moon race is now reduced to paying the Russians for a lift into space — aboard essentially the very same spacecraft we beat.

When I went to Kayak and reverse-engineered the specific dates and flights I got at Delgado, I could indeed match their price. But most of the time I couldn't.

Since the 1960s, the largest existing Chinatown between San Francisco and Los Angeles, the Salinas enclave, has been boarded up and has become the orbit of prostitution, gambling, drug dealers and illegal dumping. In the mix are a Confucian temple and a Japanese Buddhist temple. With the determination to redevelop Chinatown, Salinas organizations and students from California State University, Monterey Bay, who teach the homeless how to grow sustainable gardens, are slowly seeing a revival. The community, comprising people of all ethnic backgrounds  Latino, Filipino, Japanese among others  has taken up the cause. Their intention is to make this area a safe, livable, pedestrian-friendly mixed-use development with the old Republic Café at its heart, to become a museum where stories can be passed down in a continuum from old-timers to another generation.

As in a lot of movies these days, though, the supporting actors are the real draw. Ed Burns, who is beginning to look like Brian Williams’ more-fun brother, is fine as Banks’ friend; as Nick’s old partner, Anthony Mackie is, as always, as cool and sharp as an icicle.

I was eager to try the specialty olive stuffed naan ($4.95), a standout if you love green olives (or martinis). Owner Arun Puri said his wife developed the recipe a few years ago after watching her husband sip a martini. I loved the warm bits of chopped olives layered in the thin wheat bread. It tasted so fresh and wholesome but also bold with the salty olives. Normally, I like to dip the bread in sauces and dishes, but with this naan I wanted to savor every bite without embellishment. The kitchen also prepares an onion basil naan and naan stuffed with lamb or chicken.
"Bridesmaids" (Universal Studios Home Video, not rated/R, DVD $29.98; Blu-ray Disc $34.98). Raunchy and embarrassing (especially in mixed company), this gutter-mouthed comedy is also funny at times. Kristen Wiig of "Saturday Night Live" stars and co-wrote the script, which is why it has a late-night comic's dysfunctional view of relationships. The good themes about friendship and loyalty are undercut by Wiig's toxic take on female rivalry. Her character comes unhinged when her lifelong friend (Maya Rudolph) announces her engagement and brings a too-perfect new female acquaintance into the inner circle. If you like graphic depictions of what used to be called human intimacy and think nothing is funnier than explosive diarrhea, this one's for you. The new DVD includes both the theatrical cut and an unrated version with deleted footage. The cast joins director Paul Feig on a commentary track that pretty much excludes us from the fun, but it does explain why the film's setting is so jarring: Some of the exteriors were shot in Milwaukee and others in Chicago. Chi-waukee, anyone?

Option 4. Build a dynasty, or a one-party state. Monarchies are one way to perpetuate iron-fisted rule; uncrowned autocrats find other means. Fidel Castro turned over dictatorial power in Cuba to his brother. Haydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan handed it off to his son. China's Communists have mastered the art of one-party rule and leadership turnover that worked smoothly for decades in Mexico and the Soviet Union. Leaders from such parties accept curbs on their personal power—China's presidents have term limits—but are less likely than personalist dictators to be overthrown, disgraced or betrayed by a successor.
During the past two years, Devland has considered several other dead malls, including Rolling Acres in Akron.

She said late Friday afternoon that she did not know the exact amount of the penalty and that it would depend on the size of the contribution. However, she added, the easiest way to clear up such a problem would be for a campaign to return questionable contributions to the donors.

... We ran to the windows and saw that the streets were full of people, who looked like frenzied ants whose home had been stirred up with a stick.

The turn brought the As, which ostensibly was the exact card Gagne was looking for. But an ace was probably the only card that would cause her to lose her stack, since her freshly made straight was inferior to Juttelstad's. Not surprisingly, turning the straight inspired Gagne to move all in, leading to an instant call from Juttelstad that would make him the champion after the river came 8s. Gagne was doomed when the ace hit the board, and the only real strategic question is what's the best method of getting her money in. (Some would say she should check and give Juttelstad an opportunity to bluff, since he is almost never calling an all-in with a worse hand.)
