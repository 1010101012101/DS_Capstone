Ibises in Texas are not endangered nor are they seen as gods or emissaries of fertility. But they are fascinating birds. While not among the handsomest, they are nonetheless related to the gorgeous roseate spoonbill.
Republicans say the proposal is based on faulty economics. Raising taxes on the wealthy won't do anything to create jobs, GOP critics argue, nor will the Buffett proposal contribute in any substantial way to reducing the federal budget deficit.
Christie backs the concept of charter schools. Meanwhile, education commissioner Bret Schundler is pushing for pension changes to encourage the state’s most-experienced teachers to retire this summer — and a plan to base teacher pay on merit.
And there's this gratuitous slap from the school board: "The message of inclusion to East Cleveland children is that blacks cannot manage anything of historical and cultural significance."
There's also a more subtle switch in tone: All "scare actors" in the houses portray aggressors. No one plays the victim, Braillard says.
The move of all the local telecasts to FSM caused angst not only among those who don't have cable or satellite service, but also led to an outcry from customers of Dish Network and some cable systems (notably Mediacom) in outlying areas.

Amy Nita said she was walking her dog when she heard the shots.
"No one should be expecting any miraculous rapid recovery of municipal budgets," said Mark Muro, a senior fellow and policy director of the Metropolitan Policy program at the Brookings Institution. Sinking property values and persistent unemployment will continue to choke off revenue while stressing city service budgets across the country. "We’re talking about 5 to 7 years of relatively flat or depressed recovery."
The change means that S&P could lower its rating on U.S. government debt in the future. If that were to happen, the U.S. government would have to pay more to borrow money when it issues bonds.

It was a point coach Tom Coughlin and his staff emphasized in 2008, and something Manning today tried to pass on to teammates who have yet to play in a Super Bowl. And with Manning, a Super Bowl MVP enjoying the best season of his career, they were all ears.
Volkswagen. My orange '74 Westfalia, purchased for $500, now has maybe 10 times that sunk into it. I took it to Doheny several times a year until 2008, when I sold it to get rid of some of my "stuff." Crazy notion, I know. But it is in the hands of Jerry and Nanci Nielsen of Laguna Beach, who promised me I can camp in it whenever I want. Maybe Jerry will be the one to finally put a Porsche motor and transmission in it.
On each serving plate, place 2 slices of the fried green tomatoes, topped with 2 slices of the crispy bacon strips, followed by a spoonful of the pimento cheese. Gently place 1 poached egg on top and finish with a spoonful of the chive hollandaise.
Carson said he couldn't specify how many pay categories or "bands" the district envisions, since more study is required and the district only intends to adjust wages to market signals on a small scale at first. But it's clearly the case, he said, "that we have a greater supply of candidates" in the humanities than in math and science, so that's one potential distinction.
Goetz said the third way -- to offer any sport for which there is demonstrated interest and regional competition -- is the one in which Butler is in compliance. She said the OCR asked Butler to research that area.

The proposal caught her off-guard, but she quickly said yes. Now they're considering a spring wedding.
Firing draws protest
-- So, yeah, it's possible to pick through this and see the problems related to these wideouts. But that doesn't change the big picture: somehow, some way, the Rams have to come up with an elite receiver for Bradford. At some point, this must become a priority. Maybe the Redskins will regret spending the money on Garcon and Morgan; I don't know. But after giving those premium picks to St. Louis for the right to draft QB Robert Griffin 3, at least the Redskins determined that it was a good idea to get him some receivers. And perhaps the Rams will get around to doing the same for Bradford.

South of the border lies a people who are inherently conservative in their beliefs. Their strong family values are unfaltering, their belief in individual responsibility is apparent by their strong work ethic. The ambition to succeed leads to entrepreneurialism, and they want nothing more than to live in a safe and secure land.
Texas won its first three AL West titles in a four-year span in the late 1990s, but didn't win a playoff series then. Rodriguez hit .332 with 35 home runs and 113 RBIs in 1999, when he was the American League MVP.

In addition to the newly installed permanent collection of American, African, Oceanic, American Indian, New Guinea, Maori and Filipino art on the first and second floors, visitors can see treasures from Egypt's Golden Age in special exhibition galleries on the lower, below-ground level. The de Young-originated "Hatshepsut: From Queen to Pharaoh'' inaugurates the 12,000-square-foot gallery, which gives the museum a third more space for temporary shows and again makes it the prime West Coast venue for big touring shows.

The motion last week by New York State Supreme Court Justice Jeffrey Oing granted the academy's motion to reject a lawsuit by Grammy-nominated jazz musician Bobby Sanabria and three others. The academy said last April that after a more than yearlong review, it had decided to trim its categories by 31, in part to make the awards more competitive. That meant eliminating categories by sex, so men and women compete in the same vocal categories.
Louis Garcia lives in the Friendly Village Mobile Home Park, where a man had tried to climb a fence as he ran from police and witnesses following the stabbing Friday night.

Over the past year, Toyota has recalled more than 10 million cars and trucks worldwide for a variety of problems, from faulty gas pedals and floor mats that can trap accelerators, to braking problems in its Prius hybrid. In August, Toyota recalled 1.33 million Corolla sedans and Matrix hatchbacks in the U.S. and Canada because their engines may stall.
His attorney, however, rejected that description. He said Zimmerman was ready and willing to come forward at law enforcement's request.
That's because Harrison's boys and girls lacrosse teams were also hosting playoff opponents on Friday and Saturday, respectively. Saturday morning, four youth football games played on Harrison's field before the lacrosse and soccer games were scheduled, Dillon said Thursday evening.
Mergers that are good for corporate headquarters are usually bad news for airports like John Wayne. As a secondary airport on most airline route maps, it's a place airlines historically look to cut destinations. After the Delta-Northwest merger was finalized in 2010, Delta ended the nonstop service between Orange County and Detroit it inherited from Northwest (though it has retained Minneapolis, a Northwest hub). Delta said it was ending Detroit flights so it could start nonstop flights to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, but the service didn't click and was soon gone.
Peters flew a private aircraft for a period of 72 years. He took his initial pilot training at Westfield Airport in 1939, and he soloed after a mere six hours of instruction. He was a member of the Civil Air Patrol during the war years. From the early 1950’s he flew from an airstrip at his home on County Line Road. He accumulated 5,000 hours as a pilot, flying a succession of planes: an Aeronca Champ, a Piper Clipper, a Cessna 182, and a Cessna 210.
In the fall of 2009, Maj. Tad Hervas was a 17-year military veteran on his third combat deployment, an intelligence officer with top secret security clearance who was in almost daily contact with the CIA.

CLEVELAND, OHIO -- When it comes to achieving bliss, pan flutes and sitars don't cut it for everyone. Some people need something a little heavier.
From canceling oil leases in his second week in office to denying the XL Pipeline this year President Obama and his administration have offered up a non-stop assault on affordable energy. Now that high gasoline prices have come home to roost, the president is flailing around for an energy policy.
Akers said cameras captured Bradley parking the car about 6 a.m. on Sept. 4. At 6:02 a.m., she got out, opened the trunk, then got back into the car, he said. She appeared to be wearing the same clothing she had been wearing when she disappeared, he said.

Notes: John Burroughs (17-4) earned the top seed by hammering Lutheran North (17-7) in their first meeting of the regular season. The Bombers are led by Foye Oluokun who's putting up 18 points and eight rebounds per game. Amos Shinkle (10 points per game) and Ezekiel Elliott (10 points per game) are the only other players on the team averaging more than five points per game. Lutheran North gets most of its scoring from junior guard Anthony Virdure (23 points per game) but James Mitchell (11 ppg) and DaVante Harrell (10 ppg) are also threats to go off. Mitchell and Harrell do most of the dirty work on the glass as they lead the team with over six rebounds per game.
Duchek said Zimmerman's staffers have been like "pit bulls" this year. He said they valued his property too high by using a blue-book value instead of a market value that he believed was lower.
But it also pays to get out of Vegas, if only for a few hours. Just 17 miles from the pulsating Strip lies Red Rock Canyon, a peaceful 195,819-acre wonderland of gray and iron-oxide-stained sandstone formations embedded in cliff faces that climb as much as 1,800 feet into the sky. Or, travel 60 miles northwest on Route 160 through the howling Mojave Desert and you'll hit the town of Pahrump, home to Nevada's oldest and largest winery. Both destinations will help clear the mind and recharge the battery.
It was funny Tuesday when a TV reporter asked Bryant, of all people, how much of a distraction Artest's situation has been. "None at all," said Bryant, who didn't bother to remind the guy that he once played through a sexual assault investigation.
In eight other cases dating to 2000, BNSF employees or attorneys acknowledged the loss of evidence or other actions that could have been classified as misconduct, according to depositions and other court records. Judges in those cases didn't address that conduct, or the cases settled after those actions became known, court records show.
“Pay me now, or pay me a whole lot later,” said Tom Heard, the authority’s general manager.
Last week, plant manager John Dansby told the Post-Dispatch that he believed Wentzville had been selected for expansion because of the plant's emphasis on producing high quality vehicles at low costs.
When I planned for the opening of our first office in China, I focused on our ability to be more productive. With a 12-hour time difference, we'd have employees working during two day times at all times. But it doesn't matter how many hours you have to work if you're wasting time, energy and money.
"I am very, very concerned that we are not going to be able to control this," said O'Mara, speaking at the televised hearing by phone. "I'm very, very concerned this is going to be more problematic as months go forward."
Lorenzo said shelter staff believed they had left the kittens with the right adult, as staffers witnessed the cat cleaning the kittens. He said he was told that the kittens likely died because the mother was stressed.
Houston has stayed in the hunt despite trading away Brooks and another key player, forward Shane Battier. The Rockets didn't just give away Battier -- getting bench-warmers Hasheem Thabeet , DeMarre Carroll and a draft pick for Battier and Ishmael Smith -- they traded him to Memphis, a divisional opponent and the team team they are now chasing for the eighth spot.
If the council sticks to the budget, the city could have a $14.3 million reserve by June 2014. That would allow the council to start spending its surplus revenues, which are estimated to be as much as $9 million in fiscal 2014-15.

Richard J. Gelles, dean of the school of Social Policy & Practice at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and author of several books on abuse and violence in families, said pedophiles typically engage in a "grooming" process in which they select a potential victim and proceed to "break down the inhibitions and establish trust." Gelles said it is no accident so many people saw a "good" Jerry Sandusky.
Local Democratic clubs that endorse political candidates are anything but democratic. Sacramento's cop union would rather sacrifice its younger officers  and public safety  than pay into their pensions and preserve jobs.
The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco have appointed Christina Hellmich to a newly created position with a title long enough to fill a business card: Curator of the Jolika Collection of New Guinea Art and Consulting Curator of Oceanic Art in the Department of Africa, Oceania and the Americas.
Then they attached a GPS tracking device to his car on Jan. 22, 2010. In a hearing last year, Comeau said that the tracking records showed that Robinson had been lying on his time sheets, pretending to work for the treasurer when he was actually working his second and third jobs.
It will feature the chain’s new “connect” interior design using an open-kitchen to emphasize its made-to-order food production, more natural light in the daytime and warmer colors.
Target Center has encountered problems competing with St. Paul's newer and more modern Xcel Energy Center. But now with $150 million available to remodel Target Center, that arena will be able to compete, even though they have done much better since Tim Leiweke and the Anschutz Entertainment Group took over management of the facility.
Blackmon and Floyd are widely considered the top two wide receivers in the draft. The workout for Wright is interesting because he projects as a mid to late first-round pick. So he could be in play in either a trade down or trade up scenario for St. Louis. But should Wright somehow fall out of the first round, it almost certainly indicates he won't get past the Rams at No. 33 overall. And that may hold true even if the Rams take Blackmon or Floyd in Round 1 given the state of the Rams' wide receiver corps.
"It's ironic that today marks exactly two years that Mr. Piatek has been incarcerated," said Weiss, who long argued his client was wrongfully locked up pending trial. "I don't know if he will ever get back the two years that were taken from him."

Several provisions in the election bills just passed by the Ohio House (HB194) and Senate (SB148) would seriously impair elections in Cuyahoga County and statewide. Some provisions would also reduce voting by low-income citizens. Here, using Cuyahoga data (unless stated otherwise) are some of the worst items:

Harper wasn’t about to be overlooked, the left-fielder’s sacrifice fly in the ninth inning briefly providing what appeared to be the winning run in the ninth before the Dodgers tied it with two the bottom of the inning to set things up for -- who else? -- Kemp.
I watched alternating looks of thrill and terror cross her face as she contemplated the half-mile stretch. Down a back street we chugged along at pedestrian speed. As we hooked into the subdivision, a car passed -- here is where you came in and when the pigment drained.
"It looked like they knew the play," Kosar said.
If the culprits were caught, they averaged only about eight years in prison. Maryland doesn't execute, so the revolving doors murderers go through only encourage others to follow in their footsteps.
Instead, the district received the title by happenstance. St. Louis Public Schools has been losing students almost every year since 1967-68, when enrollment peaked at 115,543. Declining academics over the decades only accelerated the hemorrhaging as parents put their kids in private schools and left for higher-performing suburban districts in St. Louis and St. Charles counties.

It’s not entirely clear why these laws are deemed necessary. Repeatedly as the bills were being promoted in legislatures, gun advocates could not cite examples where people were unfairly charged and jailed after invoking self-defense. That ought to be a red flag.
"The issue is loaded with lots of ethical and sociological concerns, let alone the scientific challenges," Coleman said. "These animals are very sensitive. They stress easily. They're very hard to maintain. But it's a difficult situation. We're looking at the extinction of multiple species, and we need to know what we should be doing."
The town itself has changed little over the years, on purpose. But the celebration has grown, drawing up to 50 vintage cars, visitors from nearby states and encompassing more events, including a holiday homes tour, Santa, horse-drawn rides, caroling and a concert.

His two signature accomplishments are a government power grab masquerading as health care reform and a firetrap masquerading as an electric car. Not surprisingly, hardly anyone wants anything to do with either.
Differences in spice rub and length of smoking will vary taste, but by and large, 10 pounds of beef brisket is cooked the same way and costs as much for a restaurateur in La Grange as one downtown.
The season finale features one pianist, two conductors and three piano concertos, over a pair of weekends, April 27 through 29 and May 4 through 6. The pianist is Stephen Hough, the conductors are Hans Graf and Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos, and the concertos are Rachmaninoff's Piano Concertos Nos. 1, 2 and 3.

The low prices are hurting the companies responsible for bringing gas to market. Drilling in many fields is no longer profitable, and the stock prices of natural gas drillers are falling in anticipation of declining profits and scaled-back growth plans. Some of the nation's biggest natural gas producers, including Chesapeake Energy, ConocoPhillips and Encana Corp., have announced plans to slow down.

Well, playing worth a damn might help his mood.
Everyone recognized that the necessary but extremely disruptive closing of more than two dozen schools, the shrinking of district staff and cuts to many programs would probably cause further slippage in meeting the 14 standards. It did. The district dropped to meeting just three.

That earnestness is part of the appeal. While the sounds are modern, RevGen is something like an old-time Chautauqua tent meeting. Motivational spokespeople take the stages between musical acts. (A typical speaker is Tim Byrne, evangelist skateboarder, who combines the daredevil energy of youth with the passion of a dedicated believer.)
Reagan lost the first eight primaries, Santorum wrote, and "the media and the establishment made fun of his campaign; they said he had no shot, and told him to get out of the race." But then he won several states and carried his campaign into the convention, where he ultimately lost.

This is only the second time in the last five seasons that a series has gone to a Game 6 after one team opened a 3-0 lead. “After the collapse we had in Game 4, we gave them momentum, and right now they want it more than us,” Winterhawks captain William Wrenn said after Game 5. “We’ve got to regroup. Everyone has to look inside themselves –- as cliché as it sounds -– and be ready to go Monday. It’s do or die for them right now over there. They know it, and they’re playing like it on the ice. And we’re not there right now. We’ve got to work harder. It’s as easy as that. Hopefully, all the guys get it into their heads and when we go up to Kamloops we’re ready to go.”
"From the beginning of the game, we played with a lot of energy and focus," Hamilton said. "We moved the ball around well."

The quintessential ode to summer break sets the tone with a punkish guitar riff as memorable as anything the kids had heard since "I'm Eighteen," following "School's out for summer" with "School's out forever" and, inevitably, "School's been blown to pieces." Having school kids join the taunting bridge of "No more pencils/No more books" was a brilliant idea, if not as brilliant as "We got no class and we got no principles/And we got no innocence/We can't even think of a word that rhymes."

Because of this, I finally got to meet Jerry Brown. He wanted me on his KPFA-FM show, "We the People," to talk about that first book, which had been recently republished because of Bruce. I arrived at Brown's Oakland commune. He was scheduled to appear on a live CNN satellite feed in eight minutes at a local station. We jumped into his car, Brown at the wheel. We were on a road parallel with a train. "I think we can beat it!" Jerry said, and he gunned the motor. We careened around a corner, my face plastered to the passenger window and the diesel railroad engine bearing down on us as we squeaked through the lowering crossing gates.

The cast is uneven, but mostly satisfying. As the attractive narrator, Cassie Skauge could have been a bit more commanding.

R.C. Hoiles, short of stature and full of energy, was described as everything from a philosopher to a zealot.

"I do worry sometimes that we're getting into too much stuff," Bolen says, but he adds that the whole point of the current shift—which he likes to refer to as "an evolution, not a revolution"—is the lack of disconnect between "what we're doing and where we make our money." Beginning around the early '70s, designers began licensing their names to producers of everything from fragrance and sheets to jeans and menswear. At one point, there was even a Bill Blass Mercury sedan. The collections—usually the only "product" made by the designer himself—were increasingly used to drive the sales of the more lucrative licensed products. But it's a road fraught with peril. At worst a designer can end up losing control of his own name. At best there can be a creeping gap between the sensibility of the designer and the sunglasses—or whatever else—that might earn him a check.

But the old center of town, Market Street, has quietly been undergoing gentrification, and is now chockablock with family-run shops and hole-in-the-wall restaurants aimed not at tourists but at kamaainas - and priced accordingly. At Green Ti Boutique, you can enjoy a lomi lomi massage for well under half of what you'd pay at a resort spa in Wailea or Kaanapali. A Saigon Cafe - a beloved noodle house a couple of blocks from Market Street, is such a locals' hangout that it posts no sign outside. But a friend picking up takeout spotted Clint Eastwood there recently.

We need to know more about why officials in Florida were so slow in investigating and ultimately charging George Zimmerman in the Martin killing - and one can hope that things will become clearer as the case moves forward. But it's very hard not to conclude that the stand-your-ground law threw sand into the wheels of justice. As Bloomberg said, "The strongest law of all is one that is never on the books, and that is the law of unintended consequences. Stand-your-ground laws prove that that's true."

Having just returned from a week in Bordeaux tasting six-month-old barrel samples, my own assessment is that this is a vintage of variable quality, a year of highs and lows, when choosing which wines to buy is more important than ever. If 2009 and 2010 were years to stock up on Cru Bourgeois and lesser wines, (as quality levels were uniform), 2011 is a year to buy judiciously.

Worst drama: Every year needs its own awful, bright-lights, self-pity melodrama, but what to do when all the tiresome young yuppies are busy doing TV’s “Gossip Girl”? Simple — import one of them, Chace Crawford, and have him star as a sad (but sensitive!) dope dealer in “Twelve,” prowling rich-kid Manhattan where the drugs are as designer as the dresses and the parties positively Caligulan. So tragic. So significant. So whatever.

"You be careful out there," Jacque had called out as the Mobile Kitchen left that day -- as she calls out every time it pulls away. And it always seemed that she meant it as an incantation of sorts, that no harm would befall the bus as it traced its route on the back roads. But now, pulling away from the darkened rest stop, as people drift back to their cars, the only source of brightness inside the bus is a white piece of paper expressing thanks in a child's fragile hand. It seems that she could just as well have been reminding us that we must be careful with each other; a wish for safe passage for all those trying to make their way back.

Justice Virginia Long will also reach the mandatory retirement age that month.

A: In modern Europe, cities have attracted people from other continents and experienced a lot of immigration, so a lot of people write off these cities as not authentic. I feel the opposite.

Lawmakers, you see, know that Floridians will probably approve two fair-districting amendments on the November ballot.

Much also has been made of my relationship with stent manufacturers. To set the record straight, while "VIP" tours of manufacturing facilities may have been offered to me, I did not accept such gifts or offers. Various manufacturers have been said to have "rewarded" me for the use of their products. This is untrue. I did not receive personal enrichment from manufacturers during my practice of clinical medicine. Even small honoraria were donated to hospitals or foundations providing free care or medications to indigent patients.

A couple of weeks ago, a student at American University named Dylan Kaplan wrote a rather lovely op-ed in Haaretz about the importance of dialog between Israelis and Palestinians that had some rather nasty words for right-wing American bloggers Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, heads of Stop Islamization of America, which is notable for being declared an extremist group by the Anti-Defamation League. Geller's response appeared today. Its essence: How dare you talk about dialog without mentioning how nasty and anti-Semitic all Muslims are?

Alicia has the gall to question the men wanting to take their fishing boat out while she is warming herself by Manono’s fire. Geez, and this girl is a special education teacher? These women seem to have no social skills whatsoever. And then Chelsea and Alicia go back to their camp and completely blow the situation out of proportion by putting their own spin on the conversation.

Then you should have won the challenge for the tarp, and perhaps learned how to keep a fricken’ fire going before you signed up for "Survivor."

So many moments in Mr. Cameron's film stand out for intensified visual splendor: Kate Winslet's Rose, emerging from a car at the pier beneath the slowly rotating disc of her violet hat; Titanic's prow, jutting out from the screen above the first few rows of seats as the doomed vessel heads for the open sea; the industrial symphony of the boiler rooms, all aflame with the power of pounding pistons; undersea cameras threading their way through barnacled labyrinths that have become haunted surrounds; a panoply of spanking new decks and glittering ballrooms that, released from flatness, open out from the screen to bring us on board. And, toward the end, the downward-gazing spectacle of the ship's upended stern, a vision of horror with multitiered enhancement. In the face of this 3-D conversion, I'm a new convert.

They're students at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising, where, down the hall from a flat-screen TV broadcasting a runway show, past a plexiglass case of high-fashion Barbies, two of their peers are consulting with Mary Stephens, the school's self-described "big boss."¶"This is a very new-looking shape here," says Stephens, FIDM's director of fashion design.

None of these historical precedents makes Romney a shoe-in. But they indicate his prospects are better than his current polling. Perry is a perfect candidate for a time of Tea Party anger -- say, around 2010. But Romney has a better case in a time of economic fear -- like the one we may be entering -- when competence becomes a desperate political demand.

Everything: human beings, hummingbirds, moray eels, redwood trees, squash, Mozart, pot-bellied pigs, all of it. The created order is good. It is a reflection of God's goodness and His love for us, and it is meant to be enjoyed and appreciated. We were not created to hate ourselves, to hate our families, or to despise the world around us.
