-New operator for national park lodge at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park: In late March, a new operator for Volcano House, the "lodge" on the rim of the Kilauea volcano, was selected. Volcano House had become worn down and unattractive by the time the park and its longtime concessionaire parted ways in 2009. The building has been closed for nearly three years as the National Park Service tried to negotiate a new contract. Meanwhile, the Park Service spent $4 million in exterior and seismic upgrades. After an unsatisfactory first round of bids in 2010, the revised bidding resulted in the selection of Hawaii Volcanoes Lodge Co., which received a 15-year deal to operate the hotel, restaurant and other concessions. It's a partnership between Hawaii's Aqua Hotels and Resorts and Ortega National Parks, a company that operates facilities at several Park Service sites, including Death Valley and Carlsbad Caverns. The new operator promises up to $3.5million in improvements and to return a 6 percent profit to the Park Service. No firm date for reopening the lodge has been announced. Meanwhile, portions of the Circle Road around the park remain closed due to high levels of sulfur dioxide from the volcano. The emissions create the volcano fog, or "vog," that can bring hazy conditions to the Kona Coast and sometimes to neighboring Maui.

So, with the 23-year-old Sanchez, who probably has the best swing-and-miss stuff on the staff, optioned to Class AAA Memphis, it meant that almost surely veteran righthanded reliever Scott Linebrink, unscored on in eight appearances covering 8 2/3 innings, will be the 12th pitcher on the staff.

Later, he would draw on this blurring of fact and fiction in his distinctive literary style of magical realism, as with the tale of child protagonist Sierva María in "Of Love and Other Demons." In the book's preface, he spins a story of being sent on assignment in 1949 to the old Santa Clara Convent to cover the excavation of the burial crypts. He describes the exhumed skeleton of a girl whose copper hair continued to grow 200 years after her death — the supposed inspiration for Sierva María's character — and leaves the reader wondering whether it is journalistic truth or literary device.

A .291 career hitter, Schumaker plays down his natural ability to hit, but there is something behind his discomfort at the plate. The bat model he uses doesn't feel right in his hand and hasn't for years. Before the 2004 season, Schumaker received the wrong model of bats. He ordered I13 models and received R161s, the major difference being the thicker handle on the R161 bat. Stuck with the wrong bat, Schumaker hit .316 that next summer, led the Class AA league in hits and hasn't gone back to the preferred model since.

ø"The two strongest effects on public concern are Democratic Congressional action statements and Republican roll-call votes, which increase and diminish public concern, respectively," finds the study. Not that people are paying attention to those statements and votes, C-SPAN junkies aside, but they are the concrete expressions of the "political polarization" over climate change that finds an outlet in commercials, news stories, speeches and everything else, that the study suggests, in turn, is really shaping how people think about global warming. In short, we don't like politicians much (Congress now enjoys an approval rating around 11.5%, down around telemarketer levels) but we are happy to let them think for us.
GOODYEAR, Ariz. — It is all good news for the shoulder juice and Justin Masterson. That is to say the juice has stopped leaking and Masterson will be the Indians' starting pitcher on Opening Day April 5 against Toronto at Progressive Field.

The financial advisory board, made up of experts with long lists of credentials, would have say-so over all union contracts before the mayor or council. The agreement establishes revenue-estimating conferences -- much like those at the state level -- that will dictate how the mayor and council craft their budgets, and will require them to adjust mid-year when financial forecasts turn out to be off. And under the agreement, the financial advisory board will help guide a comprehensive evaluation of city departments and other expenditures, to find opportunities for consolidation, other savings or elimination.

Best Surprise: Brittany Zika. She had a dream that she was singing with Sara Bareilles, and on her birthday it actually came through as Bareilles called her on stage to sing "Gravity" with her. According to Brittany, that encouraged her to audition. As I waved her off as one of those delusional auditioners, especially after she tripped to her spot to audition, and after seeing her wear that curious outfit with the big glasses and fedora, Brittany surprised me with her beautiful, beautiful tone. Oh, you're getting the golden ticket girl! (Verdict: Hollywood!)
An uncertain quotient of propaganda informs the photographic record of the calamity, as SFMOMA's presentation makes clear. Insurance companies wanted to minimize claims, local business interests tried to make the city appear rebuildable, and no doubt survivors had an interest in coloring their own and the world's memories of the nightmare.
"Capping property taxes is only a means to controlling property tax growth. … We still need to give municipalities and schools the tools they need to actually lower property taxes. The Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee will still spend its summer undertaking an aggressive review of all facets of the property tax system. Unless we release the pressure state mandates and other cost drivers place on mayors and school administrators, property taxes will never actually go down." — Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee Chairman Paul Sarlo (D-Wood-Ridge).

I'm not particularly squeamish about needles or, indeed, most aspects of pet care, so I wasn't the least bit troubled about pushing fluids under my dog's skin every morning for the rest of his life. I did suspect, however, that the rest of his life wouldn't be that long a time period.
Yet Rivera just goes out and gets better. Since 2008, he’s converted 90-of-94 save opportunities (uh, before Sunday, he was 90-of-93). He’s still the greatest relief pitcher ever.
During a question-and-answer portion of a conference call this morning, ACC commissioner John Swofford was asked about Rutgers. He said, "I don't think it would appropriate for me to go there." That could mean a couple of things: first, the ACC still has visions of Texas running through it's head, which would result in Texas Tech coming as well; or second, the ACC already has that in the works.

When LeGrand’s tackle savagely compressed his vertebral column, doctors say he fractured the bones high on the spine. In injuries like this, bone fragments often slice through the nerves and into the pliable gray tissue at the center of the spinal cord. Nerve cells are crushed and mutilated, and within five minutes blood vessels, buried deep in this gray matter, rupture, turning the tissue soft and mushy.

Third, I swear by the power of the brine, a 24-hour submersion in heavily salted-sweet water that infuses every pore in our turkey's flesh with garlic, herbs and juniper.

The working group made a series of recommendations to the USOC board of directors on Sept. 28, 2010. Eighteen months later, the USOC still has not acted. NGBs, like USA Gymnastics, have also been slow to close loopholes that would deter clubs from hiring banned coaches. USA Gymnastics chairman Peter Vidmar and president Steve Penny said they have concerns about whether the federal Amateur Sports Act allows them to pass rules requiring athletes be registered with sanctioned clubs in order to compete in USAG-sponsored competitions like the U.S. Olympic Trials. But Starr and Hogshead-Makar, a graduate of Georgetown Law School and a professor at Florida Coastal School of Law, said there is nothing in the act that prohibits national governing bodies from enacting such rules.
Hormones: "Obesity is indeed a hormonal disorder. That idea should never have been refuted," says science writer Gary Taubes, author of "Why We Get Fat."

For the first few years, it was a homey affair, with merchants borrowing each other's refrigeration units and shuttling trays of cake around in their kids' wagons. A tie-in with First Holy Communion at St. Mary Magdalen De Pazzi helped build attendance and consolidate the festival's standing as an annual event.

What the heck does Hershel have all of those zombies penned up in the barn for anyway? Were they his old drinking buddies and he just can't bear to put them down? Is he doing sadistic experiments on them? Does he just like to get his rocks off by going out there at night and pelting them with rocks? If he was smart, he'd rig up some sort of wheel mechanism that they could turn to generate electricity to power the whole farm instead of dumping all that gasoline in that banged up old generator. Now that's a capital idea!

The check scam was effective and not very complex. The Manhattan District Attorney says The Bronx's Jasper Grayson had a fraud factory inside a Morrisania apartment building. He and co-defendant James Malloy are accused of cutting deals with tellers at JP Morgan Chase bank, TD Bank and HSBC.

"The positive effect of austerity is much stronger than most people believe," he said. The explanation for the beneficial impact is that cutting government debt generates an improvement in confidence among households and entrepreneurs, he said.
Costco enjoys this provision. And while it has been easy to villainize Costco, the "no" side does even better instilling fear in voters. After all, more money for government services isn't worth toasting if the initiative is likely to bring harm, and harm is what the "no" side of the initiative promises will come if the law changes.
MORE BAD KNEES IN PORTLAND: The Trail Blazers have had six knee surgeries on five different players this season so count me among those who weren't shocked when Portland Meadows sent out a news release this week on Taylor Jones (A.K.A. "the People's Horse).

Being touted too soon as the heir apparent will magnify any minor gaffes you make. You also risk creating factions because "co-workers often spend time unproductively trying to figure out how the succession will play out,'' warns Greg Brenneman, a former CEO of Burger King Corp. and two other concerns. He has observed multiple horse races as a director of four public companies.

Still, a pivotal question remains. Is the Book Cadillac pure fancy, one of those brilliantly wondrous sci-fi spacecrafts hovering over a decimated landscape? Or is it a flagship, a beacon, beckoning the battered legions all around it to rally and come back to life?

Arthur also has trouble early. Despite Jillian's ever-supportive attitude ("Let me see agony!") Arthur falls to the floor at one point, and says he was having trouble with his leg. "Get up!" Jillian yells at him. Jillian tells Bob that Arthur fell down on purpose, as Arthur lies on the floor saying, "I can't move my leg."

Many doctors have worked for the Visiting Nurse Association of Ohio over the years, but the 108-year-old organization hired its first agencywide medical director just last month.
Most prosaically, I was in shock, though I wasn't in any way intellectually surprised. I was far from naive about the world of interrelated events that came to our doorstep that day. Neither was I unknowing about death on a mass scale, given an earlier tragedy - one, in fact, that cut a far larger swath through the population than anything that happened on that startlingly blue Tuesday.
Of course, don't discount the game itself as a lure.
But nearly three years' worth of Adams' calendars -- from April 2006 to December 2008, when Adams was a city commissioner -- are missing from the city's website. And calendars that cover 13 weeks since he became mayor in January 2009 were posted last month only after a reporter asked about them. (Adams' calendars since January 2009.)

Zhang found that expanding and new businesses created about 102,000 jobs in Maryland during the worst quarter of the recession, the first three months of 2009. But the gains were outnumbered by losses from businesses cutting back or closing, resulting in an overall loss of 82,000 jobs.
Opponents of Prop. 29  largely the tobacco industry and groups that receive funding from cigarette companies  are trying to derail the initiative as the work of "a washed-up politician," former state Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata. It's true that Perata, a survivor of prostate cancer, helped launched the initiative and has raised money for it. But Prop. 29 is supported by the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, the American Heart Association and other reputable groups and individuals that can't be smeared by the "taint" of serving in public office.
Runway ready: On the way into New York for the fashion show, Joe teases Gia, who takes it badly. She starts crying. Danielle, Christine and Jillian show up at IMG modeling agency. In yet another totally bogus segment, Christine gets a session with a walking coach on the very day she's supposed to make her runway debut. Of course Danielle begins to put her two cents in, while the walking coach and Christine try their darndest to ignore her. So do I. Both Gia and Christine show up at their respective fashion shows (and though producers keep flashing to the tents at Bryant Park, both shows are being held off-site). Joe, Teresa, Caroline and Jacqueline sit front row at Gia's show for Caravan, because family and friends of the one child model always get the best seats in the house. Gia acquits herself nicely, as does Christine at the Rebecca Minkoff show. However, she's required to stand on the runway with the other models in a presentation, and starts to feel woozy. She comes close to spilling her cookies on the runway but is escorted away. She's fine, probably needed to eat. Danielle and her modeling agent try to make her feel better.
At the end of May, Arismendez will head to Cancun, Mexico, to try to woo Latin American aviation companies. He is keying on regional airlines. Once the company is certified for work in South America, he says he'll move on to Asia.

After a dislocated worker has calculated his or her estimated monthly expenses it is time to move to assets or income. Unemployment compensation can be a kind of temporary income after a layoff. Within a week of applying, expect to receive a notice of financial determination. A part of that notice will be the amount you can expect per week in unemployment. Normally this check will be 50 percent of your gross income.

While the film's story is deeply personal, Guerrero wanted to capture the vibrant life of a Latino community, in this case the Huntington Park area of Los Angeles. "I love it, the sounds and textures of the community. It has its own rhythm of life, its own sounds, look and feel that I think breaks some stereotypes," Guerrero said. "That's what I was excited about capturing, rather than depicting the community the same way people usually see it - gang-ridden, morbid, just a dark place. That's not how I feel about the Latino community."

But it was the part of Lloyd Dobler in 1989’s “Say Anything” — the quirkily chivalrous kickboxer who courts Ione Skye with a boombox and a tape of Peter Gabriel’s “In Your Eyes” — that established Cusack not only as the thinking girl’s alternative to Rob Lowe, but as an interesting actor and edgy star.

Located in Fells Point in the former home of the Whistling Oyster, Rye is all old wood and exposed brick. It radiates the character that old pubs seem to have in spades. A long bar stretches the length of the narrow front room, and three large booths offer some privacy in the back. The backroom setup is good for groups, but our table was the same height as the banquette — fine for drinking and chatting, but awkward for eating.
The league agreed to forward those funds last week after the Maloofs, who own the Kings, said they never agreed to pay for pre-development work. City officials dispute that claim, saying the term sheet clearly lays out how the pre-development work would be funded.

Two and a quarter centuries later, when the Clinton Township School District purchased the property to build a middle school, research into the history and material culture of this house began. Among the first to raise an alarm was the County Historian, Stephanie Stevens, who called this house one of Hunterdon County’s most endangered sites. The state Historic Preservation Office required the district to nominate the house for inclusion on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and National Register. When a property is listed on the Historic Register governments, unlike private owners, have a perpetual requirement to maintain the integrity of that property. In 2006, Clinton Township resident and real estate agent Don Sherblom registered a non-profit public charity, The 1759 Vought House, A Revolutionary War Loyalist Homestead, whose trustees, advisors, and volunteers worked over the next several years to take possession of the house and promote awareness of this rich resource. Their perseverance paid off in June 2009 when the Clinton Township Board of Education voted unanimously to subdivide the property and donate the house and surrounding land to The 1759 Vought House non-profit. The school board’s finance and facilities chair, Mark Kaplan and the new Superintendent Kevin Carroll brought a fresh outlook that made the donation solution possible.

But Wednesday mornings bring out a different mentality among the women, especially the early session. (A second group convenes at 7:30 a.m., and a third arrives at 9 a.m.). Every week, decked out with headlamps and gloves and running shoes with glow-in-the-dark heels, they conquer the dormant volcano, chugging up its staircases, dropping for push-ups when they reach level ground, shouting encouragement to one another as the light breaks over the city below.

3. Mammograms -- This is a diagnostic tool in which x-rays are taken of your breast to reveal abnormal tissues. Mammograms can detect small breast tumors in two ways: Early breast cancers often leave tiny calcium deposits in the breast as cells die, and these can be seen on the mammograms. Other breast tumors are revealed by showing masses or shadows that look like white spots on an otherwise dark breast image. Either way, these mammogram changes can be the first signal that there may be abnormal cells developing in the breast.

Until the women’s game gets to a point where the top-ranked and top-seeded players are actually worthy of those positions, we’ll stop picking Williams as the default favorite. She’s the only woman in the draw who has a real — and current — feel as being a top-flight talent. The 13-time Grand Slam champion arrives in New York following victories at Stanford and Toronto during this month’s hard court schedule — the first time she’s won back-to-back titles since 2008. And anyone who points out that Serena might have to face No. 4 Victoria Azarenka in the third round? They’re still deluding themselves about the women’s game.
On Wednesday, the Pacific Fishery Management Council released its alternatives for the 2012 ocean salmon seasons. In general, the alternatives allow longer, less interrupted chinook seasons than last year, running from as early as March 15 to as late as Oct. 31 for much of the Oregon coast.

I saw this in 1998 when I was U.S. Ambassador to Romania. That summer, Russia defaulted on its government debt, just as many tea party Republicans are urging the U.S. to do today. Romania had paid its debts for years and was committed to keeping its record intact, but suddenly, traders were selling its bonds at 50 cents on the dollar, as if they had suddenly become junk. Why? We joked that bond buyers in London, Zurich, and New York couldn't tell the difference between two eastern European countries whose names begin with the letter R. But the truth was that Keynes was right. Financial market prices are a mix of economic fundamentals — and "animal spirits." (Incidentally, Romania didn't default on its debt.)

"We began an investigation with the assistance of outside counsel when the lawsuit was filed," Fitzgerald said. "The investigation found no evidence of intent to defraud customers. However, we did conclude that some matters were not handled with the care and emphasis on compliance that we require.

WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans blocked a bill to increase small business lending today, dealing a setback to President Barack Obama's jobs agenda.
I agree with much of the editorial “Remedial math” (May 2), but strongly disagree with the remedial approach Gov. Chris Christie and acting Department of Education Commissioner Chris Cerf expect to institute — a testing program for high school students in the ninth, 10th, 11th and 12th grades. That strikes me as an exceedingly dumb approach. It was probably selected because it was relatively inexpensive and unimaginative.

Off of methamphetamine, the addicted male rats were actually pretty unmotivated by the prospect of sex with a receptive female. When there was no shot of methamphetamine involved, they were a lot less keen to mate than were rats that got the placebo shots of saline instead.

As the region's population has declined, however, the number of people using Huron dropped in recent years. Now, on average, only two babies are born there each day. In contrast, in 2010, 3,803 babies were delivered at Hillcrest Hospital, and 4,399 babies at Fairview Hospital.

-- Build a pond. Treefrogs will breed in almost any type or size of pond. Ideally, the water should be shallow along the edges and deeper than 12 inches in the middle. It should offer sun and shade, native plants that egg masses can attach to, and have slow or no water flow. It should not contain fish, which will eat frog eggs and tadpoles.

Hey, Tony: I have heard you and others identify the lack of quality wide receivers being one of the problems with this year's team. I agree but feel the lack of a true No. 1 receiver is impacting every play the offense runs. The Browns face seven- and eight-man fronts most of the time, which makes it hard to run and brings more pressure than the line can block when we try to pass. Do you agree with this assessment? -- Fred Burke, Richmond, Va.
"You're going to find, throughout this campaign season, that the president's team will be doing everything in their power to try and hold up very shiny objects," likely presidential nominee Mitt Romney said in a Fox News interview.

Perhaps this was a day the Tigers learned something important about Smyly in his bid to win the fifth starter's job. If he has a bad inning, he can both limit the damage and regain his equilibrium. In the inning after the two-run third, he retired the first two hitters, hit a man -- then picked him off.
In the late 1980s and early-1990s, when the country was embroiled in the war on drugs, when labels like "kingpin" and "drug czar" became household terms, Ohio -- like the federal government and other states -- got tough by taking down crack dealers.

I know the exotic sound of the language was part of the point -- disorientation and destabilization in a different land, and all that -- but I'd still love translations of the Chinese pop songs on Cowboy Junkies' Renmin Park. Also, Roky: "think of as are"? In his uptight liner notes, Will Sheff said you never sang any songs the same way twice, so I guess there's no reconstituting that one, but it's a head-scratcher, and you sound inspired enough to make me wonder.

There's been a legacy of bad management over the course of the years and all we're trying to determine is, is there a change necessary...to correct some of those things?

If the fact that the government would tell a business to give something away for free doesn't set off a few alarms, a little basic math should. The airline industry collected $3.9 billion in checked baggage fees in 2008 and 2009, according to Landrieu. The Transportation Department reports the figure as $1.6 billion for the first half of 2011.

'Red Knee High' is a vivid magenta coneflower that stays short (24 inches), compact (16-20 inches wide) and upright if you don't over-fertilize, as with any coneflower.

It clumps but is tall (27 inches) and wide (32 inches).

To that end, DOBI issued a bulletin in October effectively barring stop-loss insurers from "cherry picking" healthier groups through selective marketing and medical underwriting. While stop-loss insurance is not subject to the laws and regulations covering health benefit plans, it is subject to the state’s trade practice requirements, DOBI said in its bulletin. It added that the department's position is that selective marketing and underwriting of stop-loss policies to small groups counts as a violation of these requirements.

Another major bill (S1866) that appears likely to pass would change mandatory-minimum sentences for some drug offenses in school zones, giving judges leeway to dole out probation instead of prison to nonviolent drug offenders.

Opponents say it shows New Jersey is going soft on crime.

Finally, the aggressive immigration enforcement policy of the Obama administration is also a contributing factor. In the last three years, the Department of Homeland Security has deported more than 1.2 million illegal immigrants – the vast majority of them Mexican. You can be sure that some of those people came right back, but not all. And those who gave up on the United States and stayed in Mexico probably warned others not to bother uprooting and seeking opportunity in the U.S.

So if you're troubled by stuffy ears, muffled sounds or earaches, you may need to help the Marshall clean up the neighborhood. Place a container with a small amount of mineral oil in it, into a bowl or pan of warm water. Never heat the oil in a microwave. Lying on your side with your ear facing the ceiling, drip the oil into your ear using an eyedropper. Then read a book or watch the tube. The wax will dissolve in less than an hour. Tip your head to let the wax drain into a towel. You can also get an earwax removal kit for less than $10 at the corner pharmacy. If these attempts don't work, talk to your doc. You don't want to poke around in there and risk damaging your eardrum. * * *

I rushed for 1,784 yards on 220 carries with 21 touchdowns and also passed for 2,510 yards, going 148 of 220 with 10 interceptions and 28 touchdowns. So it is said that I had a great year but to me it was a disappointment due to a defeat in the state championship game. But it will never happen again.
We showed our methodology and results to independent experts on testing and data analysis to confirm our findings.
The "axis of evil" theme has been a popular one for cookbooks. "The Axis of Evil Cookbook," published last year, was written by British author Gill Partington, who, already familiar with the culinary inclinations of Bush (peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, cheese enchiladas) and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (fish and chips, "fresh fettuccine garnished with an exotic sauce of olive oil, sun-dried tomatoes and capers"), set out to discover their adversaries' tastes. The answers (with recipes) include mandoo (Korean dumplings), avocado and pineapple salad and halwar lamr (sugared dates).

It is not the first time Zegveld has represented widows and children of alleged massacres in Indonesia. Last year, she won a landmark case that prompted the government to apologize and compensate a group of widows.
Past progress in reducing measles has led some health officials to consider whether they can eradicate it. Smallpox is the only human disease to have been wiped out. Other initiatives to rid the world of diseases including polio and guinea worm remain largely stalled.
Police in Wenatchee are surprised at the amount of contraband an inmate was able to smuggle into the jail rectally. The Wenatchee World said the man internally carried a cigarette lighter, rolling papers, a baggie of tobacco the size of a golf ball, a smaller baggie of marijuana, a 1-inch smoking pipe, a bottle of tattoo ink and eight tattoo needles.
When I said that we should take out high-level terrorists like Osama bin Laden if we have actionable intelligence about their whereabouts, I was lectured by legions of Iraq war supporters. They said we can't take out Bin Laden if the country he's hiding in won't. A few weeks later, the co-chairmen of the 9/11 Commission - Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton - agreed with my position. But few in Washington seemed to notice.
Area girls teams have claimed 23 of the last 24 state championships, and the boys boast 24 of the last 25.
But the local film commission defends its estimate of Dolphin Tale's economic benefit. They say it attempts to capture the scope of the filmmakers' spending on everything from lodging to transportation, catering, construction supplies and security.
"We are on full and maximum alert now," Daniels said. "You won't be putting up anything much bigger than a pup tent in Indiana from now on that somebody doesn't come by and ask questions first."
Phoenix 88 also has Distrct 8 extending into Laveen. But shows changes to District 4 would be most pronounced. District 4 in central Phoenix would place all of the historic neighborhoods in a single district and extend south into downtown Phoenix.
But while the Reds won the League Cup in February, their Premier League form has been even worse than Chelsea's — sitting eighth — and they didn't even play in Europe this season.
Well, yeah. Supeck owns Supeck Septic Services in Medina. All four trucks in the company's inventory are equally pristine, and all the drivers follow Supeck's lead. No long hair. No earrings. Collared shirts. Shoes or boots that are at least clean, but preferably polished. Jeans are OK, but they'd better be spotless. Ironed to the point where the creases will cut you is even better.
And the focus of that celebrity lineup, just like that of the 850 employees in Adidas America on North Greeley Avenue, is the teen market.
Native son Sydney Johnson finally has the Tigers back in the NCAA conversation. Remember, Princeton hasn’t gone dancing since 2004 — the school’s longest draught since waiting seven years between 1969 and 1976.

For AT&T, the introduction of data caps has gone quite well, but some customers are complaining because their data usage reports are hard to decipher. AT&T says 90 percent of its customers on capped plans stay within the limits, but it won't say how much those who go over end up paying, on average.
Cleveland officials have indicated willingness to provide more money if that occurs. The city is paying for the repairs with money from a countywide tax on alcohol and tobacco sales.
Just a few weeks ago, the Girl Scout Research Institute released "Real to me: girls and reality TV," the findings of a survey of more than 1,100 girls from across the country, including frequent and rare watchers of reality TV programming. It found that regular consumers of reality TV shows had dramatically different views and expectations of peer relationships, their overall self-image and their understanding of how the world works than non-viewers.

"The city ... pushed a project that is perched on the blurry edge of marijuana law," Prange wrote. "It did so, not because of any desire to test the limits of the law, but because of the promise of money and jobs."
The size of the average newly constructed home in the United States fell to 2,392 square feet in 2010. The Journal was writing about homes that are 10 to 20 times that size and feature amenities like shooting ranges, bowling lanes, saltwater "plunge pools" and - my personal favorite - the 15-bathroom (plus powder rooms) home being built in Connecticut for Lee Weinstein, founder of Xand, a data storage company.

"To be honest with you . . . me and Run hated the idea," said Darryl "D.M.C." McDaniels.
Saudi Arabia "is redoubling its efforts to punish those who dare to demand democracy and human rights reform," Human Rights Watch charges.

In "Hooray for Follywood," the future Cleveland has become a hotbed of moviemaking because of Ohio's motion picture tax credit. Directors George Lucas (Public Defender Bob Tobik) and Steven Spielberg (Michael Horvitz, retired Jones Day) arrive to film a superhero movie.
As I often tell anyone who asks why I'm a birder: Because it's the best excuse I know to travel. And when we hit the road, we need to eat good home-cooked style meals, and sleep in clean, warm, relatively comfortable beds. We buy lots of gasoline and coffee. It all adds up.
We might also ask why the mother who made the emergency call did so even though she admitted to the dispatcher that the male did not appear to be armed and that her 12-year-old boy had an "active imagination."
Turns out it was just another case of the city administration putting the interests of developers ahead of those of its own citizens. I can't help but wonder whether we might have done more to convince people to visit and spend money in Baltimore if we had focused the city's limited police resources on reducing neighborhood crime rather than let the Grand Prix organizers use them as taxpayer-funded bouncers on deserted downtown skywalks.
“It’s clear there are schools, there are districts, that are under that threshold that are still engaged in some level of misconduct,” Wollack said.
"That's correct," Verrilli replied.

In some cases, drones conduct surveillance for days to establish the evidence that justifies firing a missile, the officials said.‬ Even then, a strike can be delayed or canceled if the chance of civilian casualties is too great, they said.
If all four go, and A&M heads to the SEC, it would leave just five Big 12 teams in the same quandary as the Big East's orphaned programs.
These are some of the more or less political tidbits tossed out at the luncheon, separate from the headline news that foundation chairman Doug Albrecht handed over a $3 million check to Police Chief Dan Isom, and host Joe Buck personally pledged to buy 15 TV's for the new police headquarters at 1915 Olive Street.
More to the point, policymakers need to stop making feel-good policy by press release, and focus on the unfairness of the green energy subsidy game. If they don't, the public, which repeatedly has shown that it truly does want a clean environment, will turn, rightly so.
Lake Oswego City Councilor Mary Olson, who voted against the streetcar, spoke of the public opposition in Lake Oswego to the streetcar. "I have never seen our community so opposed to anything," she said. "This is not our community's vision. It may be Metros vision, it may be your vision. But it is not our city’s vision."

The decline in enrollment during the last five years comes mostly among black and white students. Black student numbers have declined by 15 percent and whites by 6 percent.
Giving savings bonds as gifts feels old-fashioned compared to relatively new investment accounts such as 529 college-savings plans. And justifiably so: Other investments have tax advantages and the potential for much higher returns. And for those looking to defray college costs, savings bonds pose a financial risk for the very children they're intended to help: Assets in a child's name may harm chances of qualifying for college financial aid.
"It's a place of my own," she said, sitting on a couch and playing with her son, XaVion. Launched in 2008 by United Way of Central Indiana, the program aims to help young people transition from foster care to stable lives as young adults -- by age 25, as the program's name indicates. Those entering the program must be homeless, ages 18 to 25, and have some history of being in foster care.
Already playing the rest of the series without Rose because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, the Bulls got a second scare in the third quarter when Noah hurt his ankle. Noah, who scored 12 points, returned in the fourth quarter and mostly hobbled around the court.
The Capitals outshot the Rangers, 14-3, in the first period thanks to a six-shot power play after Anton Stralman’s interference call at 2:25. Ovechkin made it 1-0 at 12:43 with a slap shot from the slot that went in and out of Lundqvist’s glove after rookie Chris Kreider turned the puck over with a blind, backhanded attempt at a clear.
Gerald Wallace, loved your Game 6, sir. Put those 32 points and 12 rebounds in the career scrapbook. And never forget the sound of the Rose Garden Arena fans screaming your name until their lungs burned.
Only one ring is involved because William has chosen not to wear a ring.
Mirkarimi talked about the "shame and the ordeal that I caused," choking up outside Department 23 after being sentenced. He rued "not being able to see my wife, to only see my son on an average of two hours a day and the very public reminder that I am not the person that I thought I was."
Eilperin has traveled the world, from Mexico to Africa in search of these creatures, their habitats, their ways and their uses. She visits Hong Kong, mecca for aficionados of that supreme (and highly controversial because of environmental concerns) delicacy, shark fin soup, and, in the Indian Ocean near the southernmost tip of the African continent, gets in a cage to experience great whites up close and personal. Well, fortunately for her, not quite as personal as a nearby tuna head being used as bait on a sightseeing expedition: "the shark's teeth are jagged, and it manages to snatch a bit of the head before shoving off." As a fellow occupant of the cage remarks to her, "if they didn't demonize it, we wouldn't have come," but the main impression left by "Demon Fish" is that sharks are indeed all they are cracked up to be — and more.
Lopez said she was given two days to move out. "I told him, can you just give me the whole month because I've already made the payment?" Lopez recalled.
These take a little more time to prepare. You need to mix the dough and give it time to rise before rolling out and cutting. But a little investment in advance preparation yields a nice payoff, as most of the work can be done the day before you fry.
I skipped church last week. Instead of getting up early, rushing through a shower, grabbing a quick breakfast and making last minute edits to a sermon, I slept late and ate scrambled eggs and toast with my family. It was a simple Sunday breakfast but it felt like a royal feast for a preacher on holiday. I read the paper, including the bits I normally don't get to until Monday.

SystemChange doesn't rely on memory and personal effort, she says, but instead redesigns the family environment to make healthy choices inevitable. For example, families that grocery shop with a list stock their refrigerators with more fruits and vegetables and eliminate unhealthy foods in the home.
The move came as Petrino said he would not appeal his firing and seek any of the $18 million buyout that was part of his contract. His agent, Russ Campbell, sent an email to athletic director Jeff Long late Thursday saying Petrino had accepted “responsibility for the events that led to the university’s decision to terminate his contract.”
Other facilities in the Beaverton area have innovative systems to reduce storm runoff. Clean Water Services' field operations facility on Southwest Merlo Court also has porous pavement, a planted roof that absorbs rainwater and native plants. Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District used pervious asphalt when it remodeled the Garden Home Recreation Center.
FitzGerald inherited what was probably Ohio's biggest patronage pit. Let's not be naive: There's a place in government for politics. Karl Rove and David Axelrod had offices near the president's for a reason -- and the reason wasn't to oversee the distribution of agriculture subsidies.
The Dutch have rejected a move toward greater European unification before, in 2005, when the country said no in a referendum on creating a European constitution. But that vote had to do with political symbolism, rather than with the mechanics of currency union.
I don't know who this "Mickelldeit" cretin is, but he's on the right track. In fact, if Slater and his ilk really thought that single-family is the highest-value zoning in Old Towne, then there would be no need for downzoning – because the free market would dictate that property owners will only build single-family even if they have the option to build apartments.
"Family courts have also changed dramatically," he said. "We used to just lock kids up. Today, we serve about eight times as many kids as we did in 1990, but in what you might call an outpatient basis, which requires additional juvenile officers."

The Grassler family had to move from North Carolina when Frank, who works for Gilead Sciences, was relocated to the firm's offices in Foster City. Holt, his wife, said the company's relocation specialist took them on a whirlwind tour of 11 Bay Area cities. Half Moon Bay wasn't on the list; they had to ask to see it.
I can't do anything with impact. I have genetic osteoarthritis. My father had it and so does my brother. The bulimia didn't help, either. (Eating disorders are associated with an increased risk of fractures, research shows.)

Adam Smith: "Things change," Crist said a few days ago. And boy was he right. There are so many mistakes and misjudgments you can point to, but the single biggest was Crist's decision to run for Senate. His popularity probably would have tumbled inevitably, but few credible challengers would have stepped up early on if he ran for re-election.
The devices have also spawned a cottage industry of people who go around and legally challenge the cities who adopt the technology, often with success.

City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana said a budget proposal this year calling for ongoing furloughs in the city attorney's office could have been avoided if the union representing workers there had agreed to give up a scheduled 6.75% raise. The furloughs will save the city more than $9 million, he said.
The margin of victory was the most for MU in the 210 games in the series since the Tigers beat the Sooners 66-22 in 1922.
But it was during that stint in Spokane that Emerson realized talk radio was the format for him. One memory stands out.
Kmart offers exclusive brands that include Jaclyn Smith, Joe Boxer, County Living, Route 66 and Smart Sense.
Both are inveterate flip-floppers, but Gingrich has solid partisan credentials. He led the revolt of 1994 that brought a GOP majority to Congress for the first time in eons. He pushed through the path-breaking welfare-reform law. But he strikes me as one of those politicians whose “highest and best use” is in a legislative arena, not in an executive position. In a forum where he’s one vote among many, the colleagues are there to shave off the sharper edges.
The House-passed budget begins by making no structural changes for those who are currently enrolled in Medicare or will enroll in the next decade. Medicare will function exactly as it does today for those who are 55 and older. For younger workers, Medicare will provide a list of guaranteed coverage options — including the traditional plan that exists today — from which beneficiaries can choose the one that best fits their needs.
She continued: ''And then suddenly I was like, 'What are you doing to me? Ah!' And I suddenly had to put my hat down because we were literally like Moses parting the waves of Coachella getting to the front.''
Inside the theater, nearly 200 guests will stand on a round platform to watch the film unfold from the highest point of the dome, down to floor level and in every direction all around. It's like a planetarium without seats, but aimed below the surface of the sea.
Miller averaged 14 points and 7.3 assists in 269 games in his first tour with Denver, but those numbers came as a starter. Ty Lawson has taken over the starting point guard role, and Miller is happy to come off the bench if that's his role.

"Rick Santorum's faith should play well in Illinois," said Tobin Grant, a professor of political science at SIU who worked on the poll. "It's unlikely that people will choose him because he's Catholic per se, but as a committed Catholic, Santorum shares the same values, beliefs and viewpoints as many Republican Catholics in Illinois. In central and southern Illinois, Santorum will also draw support from evangelicals and other conservative Protestants who will value his family and faith."
During the immigration argument Wednesday, several justices were scrupulous about challenging both sides. Roberts noted that parts of the Arizona statute impose “significantly greater sanctions” than federal law does. Sotomayor informed Verrilli at one point that she was “terribly confused by your answer” and let him know that “it’s not selling very well.”
Stanford played its typical tenacious defense, but on this day, before a loud contingent of Wildcats fans in the crowd of 6,231, Arizona's was even tougher. The win gave the Wildcats a sweep of the Bay Area; they handed Cal its first home defeat of the season Thursday night.

Buy a boxed falafel mix for making fried patties of ground fava and garbanzo beans at home. Or buy already prepared foods from the eatery -- couscous, tabbouleh, cucumber yogurt salads, shawarmas, hummus and grilled meats.

Over the last three years, Cleveland has deconstructed 49 buildings, including a number of Neighborhood Progress projects. None of that would have been feasible without federal grants to bridge the financial fissure between deconstruction and demolition costs.
Senior administration officials said Obama took a strong personal interest in filling the World Bank vacancy after current president Zoellick announced in February he was stepping down. Obama and his advisers considered more than a dozen candidates, including well-known figures in the administration.

There were still more possible motives, the police files revealed. Jordan's past affairs, some allegedly with married women, were a poorly kept secret. Police chased the "jealous husband motive" for months, but came up empty.
Defending team champion Thompson Valley did nothing to hurt its chances at repeating, with a meet-best 13 championship swims and seven more in the consolation round, with three divers in the rotation. D'Evelyn made a strong push with 11 and four, but has no divers entered.

Only after America endured the scars and unspeakable losses of another world war and a conflict in Korea did Congress in 1954 swap Armistice" for "Veterans," a nod to American veterans of all wars.
But it's also about answering this question: Will it change my life? For me, the discovery that I could make my own granola bars changed my life. I felt like I was a slave to boxes of TLC granola bars. If I didn't have a perfectly wrapped bar to throw in the back seat when I picked the kids up at school, I would be in a panic.
The little kid presided over what was a typically wild fourth round at Augusta National. The greens were so fast, they seemed painted rather than grown. The best thing to do was to avoid putting on them.

The move triggered a showdown with FitzGerald, a Democrat. After weeks of back and forth, FitzGerald promised not to send unsolicited ballot applications this year. Husted committed to sending applications to voters statewide for the 2012 presidential election.
One night I saw firsthand how they performed under pressure. Just as we'd finished our ceviche we saw smoke wafting across the high ceiling. Then, the kitchen went dark. The manager moved from table to table, informing guests of the problem. It took more than 20 minutes to get the hot line running, but by that time the kitchen was clearly in the weeds.

And who needs Miami when you can linger in the cool Butcher & The Burger dining room outfitted with white subway tile, old scales, vintage meat hooks, rusty meat saws, butcher block tables and sharp industrial logo-stamped metal bar stools? The whole authentic, old-timey feel simultaneously channels a touch of warm nostalgia and a bit of fear that you might have discovered a real-life version of "Sweeney Todd." Any fear, though, is tempered by the incredibly happy staff displaying a cheerfulness that reinforces that at Butcher & The Burger, you really can have it your way.

Egypt is a land of beguiling rhythms, many defiantly beating far from Cairo, the capital, where a new government is emerging.

He said "Dad" for the first time in two years.

Cut fresh lemon verbena branches and wash outside to remove any slugs, spiders or creepy-crawlers. Then carefully snip leaves off, bypassing any nibbled leaves or ones with brown spots. A few branches should yield a big mound of leaves. Toss them onto newspaper to dry for an hour or so. Then throw a cup of Epsom salts into a food processor along with a double handful of leaves (it's OK if they're still moist). Blend until the leaves are finely chopped. Add more salt and more leaves. Add the pickling salt. Blend once more. Then mix the mixed salts (now green) into the remaining Epsom salts. Add optional lavender flowers (only blooms, please). Pour into a large jar and shake. Now store it in the linen closet. Voilà. You've made a jar filled with weeks of sensational baths.

It's been a wonderful ride for the Blues, who are streaking toward the second-best finish in franchise history. We didn't see this coming, and that's a bonus. The best dream seasons happen when we least expect them. Ask the 1999 Rams, or the 2006 or 2011 Cardinals.

But let's go back to the broader issue of sexual violence and that fact that a woman is sexually assaulted in the United States every two minutes. Whatever the outcome of the proceedings against Strauss-Kahn, this high-profile case has brought the subject of sexual assault into the realm of public discussion, and that is a good thing. But as long as rape and sexual assault are so common in the United States, we can hardly say the system is working just fine.

For M, it's about the basics. M, 32, is the single mother of 10 children, with an 11th on the way. Mom and the kids are homeless, and they're having a hard time finding a place to live that's safe for them; they are moving around between relatives and friends. Adding to the difficulty is the fact that M's 12-year-old daughter is bipolar and frequently runs away. M hopes to find a permanent home for her family. They'll need furnishings, starting with a queen-size bed, seven twin beds, a table and chairs and a washer and dryer. M would really like to be able to give her children something for Christmas.

The Sasson study was to Beinart's thesis approximately what Fat Man was to the city of Nagasaki. A whopping 82 percent of American Jews feel that U.S. support for Israel is either "just about right" or "not supportive enough"—and that's just among those Jews who describe themselves as "liberal" or "very liberal." Among those calling themselves "middle of the road," the figure rises to 94 percent. Regarding the settlements, just 26 percent of even liberal Jews think Israel should dismantle all of them; among moderates, the figure drops to 10 percent. Generationally speaking, there even seems to be a rightward tilt among younger Jews. Consider Jerusalem: 58 percent of those between the ages of 18 and 29 oppose re-dividing it. Just 51 percent of their parents and grandparents feel the same way.
Trent Richardson went through his pro-day paces Thursday in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
More seriously, though, Haith and Bowers' teammates consider him a valuable cog of a team that also is made up of reserves and redshirts enmeshed in the vibe.
The competing impulses also help explain Utah's unique policy for letting unauthorized immigrants drive legally. It is one of only three states (along with New Mexico and Washington state) that give them that permission, but it is the only one to give them a unique card - instead of a normal driver's license - to do so. The new package of immigration laws now will require those drivers to submit their fingerprints and undergo criminal background checks.

Ripken: I think you do a little long-term planning, and I did when I first retired. You take stock of what you want to do. I stayed attached to baseball through the kids and through minor league baseball, and I'm very satisfied with the schedule it allows me to have, which means I'm home until my kids go off to college. I value that time. I didn't have it with my dad, and since I had a choice, I chose to do that and chose to be there for all their events in their lives. And then when you start to look down the road, and I think we all think maybe in terms of five years and maybe sometimes as long as 10, but recently I've been starting to think about, you know, all this other stuff is great, but what do you really know about? And what I really know about is baseball at the highest level. So, those conversations have been ongoing with Mr. A [Orioles owner Peter Angelos] for a long time. I did talk to Andy MacPhail because I was in the design process for a little while with the spring training process and got to know Andy a little bit, so that naturally kind of elevated some of the conversations, but they're really just explorations of … how do you bridge back? If there is interest and there is opportunity, what kind of opportunity will it be? What are you interested in? What are you not interested in? And I think the urgency got pushed way forward when the Orioles got off to a tough start. Speculation then sort of occurs, and maybe there was wishful thinking on many people's parts, but, you know, then you have to deal with it in a way. For me, it's just an ongoing process. It's been that way and it continues to be that way, and I'm satisfied. I'm not ready to jump in with both feet these days because Ryan is a junior in high school and Rachel is a junior in college, so that timetable still important to me, and I won't separate from that.

The longer you study O'Sullivan's photos, the more you wonder if there was a sly and humorous 1970s Chicago style of songwriting. Goodman was funny and made a point in his stage show never to linger in one mood. Prine has rapier wit and is a gifted storyteller. Eddie Holstein is wry. His brother Fred, who died in 2004, was the most pensive of the group, as the photograph depicts. Fred Holstein does not seem to be in on the joke going around the kitchen table.

To date, the Obama administration has stuck with such thinking. Its 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review Report states that, after successfully concluding current wars, "In the mid- to long term, U.S. military forces must plan and prepare to prevail in a broad range of operations that may occur in multiple theaters in overlapping time frames. This includes maintaining the ability to prevail against two capable nation-state aggressors." And this fall, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta repeated this planning assumption.
