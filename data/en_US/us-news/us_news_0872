Toner said this week the hybrid Kawaoka's lab made would not be expected to be more dangerous than ordinary human flu, while the altered bird flu virus from the Dutch lab could be more lethal.

I’m really hoping that it'd be finished by now but I'm also not going to rush it. It takes as long as it takes. I want it to be exactly how I want it to be. I have a lot of balls in the air. I'm not trying to be too hard on myself. I'm trying to definitely have it done by the end of this summer at the very latest. Everything takes a little longer than it takes. Mickey, dear friend, he’s mixing a lot of tracks we have finished. We're gonna wait 'til it's done.
The Kings and the St. Louis Blues played 1-0 games the past two times they met. There were times in those games when someone noticed a puck was rolling around somewhere, but not often. Both teams are accustomed to stringing piano wire across the blue line and then putting the net inside an airless chamber. They would rather bleed than let you score. Not that it will be an option.

* Congratulations to Missouri head coach Gary Pinkel, his staff and the MU players for the successful recruitment of Springfield Hilcrest wide receiver Dorial Green-Beckham. Obviously, this was a meaningful and high-profile "get" for Mizzou. DGB was the No. 1 WR of this recruiting class; some services ranked him No. 1 among all recruits. ESPNU had him at No. 3. Doesn't matter. DGB was coveted by major programs including the biggest of the bigs. And it was important for MU to keep him home. I believe kids should go anywhere they want to go; they have no obligation to stay home. And Green-Beckham clearly had a lot of very attractive options available to him, but he chose the Tigers. This reflects well on Pinkel. It also reflects well on Green-Beckham; he played this straight up, with no mind games, no nonsense.

The turkeys cook quickly, in under an hour, and can be entertaining to watch, particularly for the newer guests.

Kudos to a couple of regular Go Seek players for their clever responses.

Extreme Rules was a perfect example: subtle nuances such as a slight increase by the commentary team of calling moves and holds (and Michael Cole shedding most of his heel persona), John Cena and Brock Lesnar delivering a match style never before seen in WWE, then Cena speaking to the audience after his match where the line was intentionally blurred if it was meant to be for when the PPV cameras were turned off or not (many fans on the internet, after all, love to know what happens after a TV taping or pay-per-view event goes to black). New (in some cases old) faces on Raw or Smackdown such as Abraham Washington, Ryback, Antonio Cesaro, Darren Young / Titus ONeil, Lord Tensai, Damien Sandow and Brock Lesnar are leading a fresh movement (unrelated side note, if you haven’t seen him yet, I would go out of my way to watch this episode of FCW TV, which includes a promo from Bray Wyatt, formerly Husky Harris.

An abstract of the Genentech-sponsored study on the ophthalmology conference website states that there are differences in the safety of the two drugs. However, the abstract also says that the study is limited by incomplete information such as whether the patients have smoked or had high blood pressure.

The Genentech-sponsored study reviewed collected data, while the Clinic-led study is actively testing more than 1,200 patients at 44 sites over two years.

Tressel's superiors, Athletic Director Gene Smith and university President E. Gordon Gee, have come off as either clueless (Smith) or witless (Gee). In the December news conference, Smith breezily said there was no "systemic" problem at Ohio State, an assertion that now seems to have been wishful thinking. During the epic embarrassment of the March news conference about the cover-up, Gee joked that he worried Tressel would fire him, not the other way around.
That clarifies things, doesn't it? Here you've been walking around wondering whether "associated rules" referred to section 18G.02 or 18G.01. Now all doubt is removed. The path is clear.

far these 49ers have come since that 24-3 trouncing they took back in August at the Superdome in the teams' exhibition opener. Now, Harbaugh's "Who's got it better than us? No-body!" group is drawing comparisons to the good ol' days of Montana, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott and Steve Young. And of course, Dwight Clark, who came through with "The Catch" to beat Dallas in the NFC title game on Jan. 10, 1982.

In 1896, mining magnate Griffith J. Griffith donated 3,015 hilly acres that became L.A's biggest park. Later he put up the money for Griffith Observatory and the Greek Theatre. And in between donations, the hard-drinking Griffith shot his wife in the face (it wasn't fatal) and served two years in prison. But you're here to hike, not judge. Drive to the shady corner of Griffith Park known as Ferndell (or Fern Dell, depending on the source), park by the Trails Café, then head uphill. Yes, on foot. Follow the West Observatory Trail for about a mile up the scrubby hills until — voilà! — three domes and a flawless lawn appear. That's Griffith Observatory, the city's hood ornament. It opens at 10 a.m. on weekends, noon on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. Browse the wonders of science within the 1935 building, which reopened in 2006 after a dramatic addition, mostly underground, that added dozens of exhibits and a cafe. Though shows in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium cost $3-$7 a person, most of the building is free. Outside again, savor one of the city's best views. Check out the bust of James Dean. (His 1955 movie "Rebel Without a Cause" includes scenes here.) Then head back down the hill to the Trails Café and its outdoor picnic tables, avocado sandwiches, vegan chili and homemade baked goods. Your kids — the same kids who begged you to carry them down the hill — will soon be hopping among the stumps and hay bales.

By extension, they made Gilbert look like the player-friendly owner he's always been. That's the biggest shame about Gilbert's image post-July 7. He gave James an opportunity to paint him as an owner who never really had his player's backs and, given the chance, would stab them on their way out.

That's because union leaders and some lawmakers say the idea of readily firing teachers is too reminiscent of Senate Bill 5, the Republican-backed collective bargaining law that was soundly repealed by voters last November.

The next morning we headed to the church to see the putz, among the most cherished parts of a Moravian Christmas. Derived from the German putzen, "to decorate," a putz is a crèche, generally under a Christmas tree. With music and narration, this one is more elaborate than most, featuring not just the Nativity but a series of scenes, each individually lighted as the story progresses. They are nestled on a vast carpet of live moss, gathered each November in the Pocono Mountains as a community exercise, and accented with wood and stones. Many of the figures are antiques brought from Germany.
The problem? Private schools don't produce the rich, complex and detailed statistical reports about their student bodies that the state requires of public schools. We decided to tackle the challenge anyway.
The U.S. auto industry opened the door for two-wage systems some three decades ago, suggesting that as older workers retired second-tier counterparts ultimately would gain those jobs, along with pay increases.

We find that the increase in oil prices in the last decade is mainly due to the strength of global demand, consistent with previous studies. However, financial speculation signifi cantly contributed to the oil price increase between 2004 and 2008. Our analysis pins down the start of speculative forces driving oil prices in 2004, which is the time when signifi cant investment started to flow into commodity markets.

Soloist Dudana Mazmanishvili might have seemed a counterintuitive choice for this particular concerto. Her most memorable quality was an unflagging lyricism and a limpid sound that made even the most firework-ridden passages sound like an intimate personal confession, never overly sweet or maudlin. She conveyed strength as well, but never unnecessary force. If surprising, hers was still a lovely, fresh performance of the popular work.

The sweetness of this dessert is adjusted by the amount of honey in the sauce. Make the crepes and poached pears ahead of time, then finish the sauce just before serving. The ripeness and flavor of the pears are critical to this dish because the sweetness of the fruit also adds flavor to the sauce.

Instead of a sweet wine, you can use a dry, fruity unoaked white wine and more honey in the poaching liquid. Serve the crepes with a slightly sweet sparkling wine or late harvest white wine.

Built southwest of Scottsdale and Camelback roads, the Soleri Bridge was designed as a pedestrian passage and gathering place. It was designed by visionary Paolo Soleri, who lives in Paradise Valley, and was dedicated in December 2010. At $3.2 million, it is the largest installation ever undertaken by Scottsdale Public Art. The 130-foot-long pedestrian bridge spans the southern side of the Arizona Canal. Its design demonstrates solar movement by marking seasonal events, such as the equinox and solstice. The idea for a bridge began more than 20 years ago as Scottsdale began floating ideas for moving pedestrians over canals to retail and dining establishments. City leaders envisioned a high-exposure piece as a legacy and a visitor draw. | Photos

Navigating the 170,000 square feet of Vegas' biggest casino, the MGM, I had better luck. A couple of rows of six-deck $10 blackjack tables offered some acceptable rules. A 3-2 payoff for natural 21s. Dealer standing on all 17s. Re-splitting aces. Doubling on any two cards. All in all, a .26% edge for the house, or 2.6 cents lost on every $10 bet. But you have to know what to look for. Sitting right next to these decent tables were others where the odds were ominous for the player. Nearly identical looking "single-deck" tables with a 6-5 payoff and miserable odds.
