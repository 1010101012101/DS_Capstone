Ganley, who doesn't give much money to politicians, says his outsider status is a plus. But it poses a challenge in a party primary. His opponent, former congressman Rob Portman, who also was a top official in the Bush administration, has support from a big majority of Republicans in the Ohio General Assembly and in Washington. U.S. Sen. George Voinovich of Cleveland, who is retiring next year, has endorsed Portman as his successor.

Edwards, a former senator from North Carolina, is accused of accepting more than $900,000 in illegal campaign contributions during his 2008 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.

As to his contention that the "childfree movement" is disorganized and uncertain about policy, there would be an element of truth to that, if I believed there were a cohesive "childfree movement" to speak of. The childfree aren't monolithic in their beliefs. There are hard left, hard right, moderate and politically apathetic childfree people. In terms of religious beliefs, they're across the board. The one (and only) thing they have in common is never having been, and never wanting to become, a parent. The time may come when childfree PACs form, but it hasn't happened yet. There is no "Million Childfree March" penciled in on my calendar yet, either.

Also at issue is openness. The inaugural directors will set the tone for how JobsOhio accounts to Ohioans for its actions and its use of taxpayer dollars. Nothing would be more fatal to taxpayer confidence than a closed-door mentality. JobsOhio's transparency is as important to its success as its development programs.
At least since the Renaissance, artists in the West exploited the binocular inclinations of human perception rather than subverting it. Fixed devices like one- or two-point perspective — the proverbial illusion of train tracks converging as they recede into space, even though the mind knows such a thing can't happen without causing a major train wreck — were developed and elaborated. Transparent color-glazes reflected light, illuminating darkness. The seductive appearance of physicality and mind-boggling spatial depth were created.

These sanctions would drastically increase pressure on Iran's leaders to end their illicit activities. Although such steps could tighten the world's oil supply, putting pressure on the world economy, other suppliers could increase production to fill at least part of the shortfall. And the impact would certainly be tiny compared to the price we would all pay if Iran got nuclear weapons or if military action were used to stop Iran from acquiring them.

One of the most jaw-dropping transformations of the night belonged to Mike, 41, of Oakland. He won the $100,000 at home prize, and was virtually unrecognizable (although he filled out a suit almost as well as Dolvett Quince, Jeremy's trainer). Mike was eliminated early in the season after crossing paths with the misunderstood Ana-Conda, but he used that termination to fuel his determination. "I said, 'What if I can do it all at home?'" He stopped short of calling it a vindication, however, because he stressed that he did this for himself, and no one else.

The better approach would be to eliminate the restrictions by election district right away. That would allow a true free market for existing licenses, which would benefit both those who want to sell but now can't and those who can't afford the current high prices. Any new licenses the county issues should not be transferable, and the county should create a sunset on the transferability of existing licenses. It should also eliminate restrictions on how many licenses any one corporate entity can hold, a rule that has limited the development of high-end chain restaurants in the county.

ANSWER: I had just finished graduate school and I was living in New Orleans.

Miklowitz, who wrote "The Bipolar Disorder Survival Guide: What You and Your Family Need to Know," told the Los Angeles Times that the condition "formerly known as manic-depression, is typically lifelong and recurrent." Miklowitz, a psychiatry professor at the UCLA Medical School, outlines the symptoms and notes that "bipolar disorder and creativity have been linked," adding "that first-chair violinists are more likely to have been treated for the disease than others -- and that Tchaikovsky, Van Gogh and Hemingway were said to have been bipolar."

Seven months later, after the boys were arrested, I visited the house on Elm Drive. It is deceptive in size, far larger than one would imagine from the outside. You enter a spacious hallway with a white marble floor and a skylight above. Off the hallway on one side is an immense drawing room, forty feet in length. The lone piece of sheet music on the grand piano was "American Pie" by Don McLean. On the other side are a small paneled sitting room and a large dining room. At the far end of the hallway, in full view of the front door, is the television room, where Kitty and Jose spent their last evening together. On the back wall is a floor-to-ceiling bookcase, filled with books, many of them paperbacks, including the American-history novels of Gore Vidal, Jose's favorite author. On the top shelf of the bookcase were sixty tennis trophies -- all first place -- that had been won over the years by Lyle and Erik.
Harrington, 32, is only 8-for-27 from the floor in the series and averaging 10.5 points — well under his regular-season average of 14.2.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- It could have been from Saturday Night Live, were it not real. There's Al Gore, then the vice president, on an Ohio stage. A Democrat and champion of environmentalism, Gore is running for president. And right behind Gore is a young guy in an Ohio State University sweatshirt, smiling and clapping. Each time the video camera turns, there's this guy, smiling over Gore's shoulder, in the crook of his arm, everywhere, like Forrest Gump.

Most important, our biological clock regulates sleep. No other bodily function responds more emphatically to its tick. Nor has any sentient state been more altered by modernity, owing in large measure to the prevalence of shift work. Nearly 20% of wage earners in industrialized countries labor after dark, not including "moonlighters" toiling at a second job. In preindustrial communities, by contrast, few trades operated around the clock and scarcely any were distinctly nocturnal, apart from night watchmen and "goldfinders" responsible for emptying cesspools (a task as perilous as it was noisome).

He also wants a complete payroll tax holiday for increasing the size of the payroll by up to $50 million above the prior year, either by hiring new workers or raising the salaries of the existing labor force.

Haslam: I think Coach Flood is more than qualified for the job. I am sure any player present or past would tell you the same. His strength is the ability to teach, and even though that is the main job of a coach, he has a way of getting the best out of players.
Okoye, who recorded four sacks, played in all 16 games last season but made only one start. Still, he ranked behind only Henry Melton for playing time for interior linemen and now the Bears have a considerable void to fill. Expectations are Stephen Paea, the second-round pick last season, will step forward after earning more playing time in the second half of the season. Undrafted free agent Jordan Miller is also an option.
"It's just one of those sensations," Garces says. "It brings back a Sunday afternoon in Chicago, probably a cold afternoon, watching a Bears football game, and my mom making empanadas that we'd eat at half time. It brings me back to a good place, to a good time in my life."

That SLU didn't prevail is ultimately a testament to the presence of Michigan State's Draymond Green, a rare player who can take over a game when he needs to, and a player SLU, like just about every other team, cannot match.

Sound of My Voice reminded me, in its creepy calm and its minimalist production values, of The Man Who Fell to Earth, the enigmatic 1976 David Bowie stranger-in-a-strange-land thriller. There's a documentary-like realism at work here (and at play), and Marling, projecting an aura of unpredictability and vulnerability - but also ferocious certainty - has no trouble inhabiting the role of this self-professed time-traveler, ready to save her believers from the apocalypse she knows is coming.

Usually that's a tree, sometimes a telephone pole, fence or wooden building. It may be heavily drilled and stocked: A ponderosa pine near Santa Barbara held 50,000 acorns.

Public health groups pushed for the language on fundraisers, which encourages the secretary of Agriculture to allow them only if they are infrequent. The language is broad enough that a president's administration could even ban bake sales, but Secretary Tom Vilsack signaled in a letter to House Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller, D-Calif., this week that he does not intend to do that.

The Canadian duo of Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins continue to prove they are worthy of the praise being heaped upon them. Bennett was a positive voice for the team during the afternoon, and while he didn't take many shots, he played solid defense and chased loose balls as if it were a real game. At age 17, Wiggins is one of the youngest participants ever to suit up for the World Select Team, and looked a bit passive in the scrimmage session. In drills, however, Wiggins made nearly every shot he took. Curling out top, off-the-dribble and catch-and-shoot, the youngster has great form on his shot.

Mao came up with a pretty interesting rationale for why the Forbidden City should be revered, not scorned: It was built with the labor of many thousands, if not millions, of Chinese peasants. Therefore, it was as much a symbol of their efforts and love of country and it was of their rulers. Since Mao also proclaimed the victory of the Communist state from the front entrance to the palace in 1949, he also had personal and political reasons to leave it untouched.
So with a massive complex of roundabouts about to open seconds away from a major senior housing complex in Bloomington, the state is inviting them -- and everyone else -- to an open house this week to learn more and even practice first.
