"That's one of the challenges we have here: to get away from the cliches and the homogenization of Mexican food. But at the same time, authenticity is very important," Sanchez says. "As a chef, you always want to create a challenge for yourself."
Another way to know if abundant HDL is valuable is to look at its particle size -- and in this case, smaller is better. A large study has found that people with high HDL (above 70 milligrams/deciliter) but very large particles had more risk of heart disease than people with low HDL (under 40), probably because larger particles aren't as active. But again, there's no easy commercial test for that.
The Senate Finance and Revenue Committee approved a measure that would shift half of personal income tax kicker rebates into a state "emergency reserve fund" that could only be tapped during economic downturns. If approved by both chambers, the measure would be placed on the November 2012 ballot.

An arcane and oracular work from Liszt's late period, "Unstern! Sinistre, disastro" - a collection of unharmonized melodic pronouncements and eerie dissonances - led into the recital's first fully sensuous offering, the same composer's "Les jeux d'eaux À la Villa d'Este." The piece's rippling arpeggios, a depiction of splashing fountains, yield to some melodic transformations in the middle of the texture, and Aimard gave full voice to both.

11:55 a.m. Rubin asks Marks about malingering. She says people who are faking will usually give themselves away. "It's really hard to fake mental illness," she says. She says there is no evidence that Neuman looked up psychiatric terms on the Internet. She noted that she didn't base her opinion solely on what Neuman told her, but other people's observations that "help support that the things he's reporting are genuine."
In the final analysis, the Giants' 10-10 record to this point pretty much says it all -- mediocre. In addition to their defensive woes, the Giants watched the Padres commit three errors themselves and also throw in a passed ball, but they couldn't take advantage offensively.
Beaujolais Nouveau is light enough to serve with appetizers or pizza or to wash down your turkey sandwiches on Friday. I even found it to be a good match for a veggie burger topped with smoked Gouda.

That latter category was dominated by "Una Noche," Lucy Mulloy's drama about three Cuban teenagers who plot an escape to America on a homemade raft. Among other honors for the film, Ms. Mulloy was named the festival's best new director. But the prizes were overshadowed by a real-life drama reflected in the film: two of the actors, Javier Nunez Florian and Anailin de la Rua, vanished in Miami en route to the film's Tribeca premiere. They're now reported to be seeking political asylum.
In a sense, every life event is a new occasion for the loss of what might have been had not illness changed the caregiver and patient so irrevocably. Every new sign of deterioration, every new symptom, signals a fresh loss of hope.
The self-guided tour takes about three hours, and in some ways, the museum saves the best for last. The walkway into the final galleries is flanked on one side by a long wall of floor-to-ceiling glass windows offering a breathtaking view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the bay. The second-to-last gallery houses a 12-foot intricate model of Disneyland as Walt conceived it, which brings audible oohs, ahs and wows from nearly everyone.
“Wrecking Ball,” unlike the rest of the DVD set, is not just straight performance, but an artful mix of performance, vintage photos, black-and-white footage of Springsteen soundchecking in the empty stadium, and some of the fireworks — not the musical kind, but actual fireworks — that Springsteen added to help say farewell to the venue in style.

1. It's a Wonderful Life (1946): Almost a shame this film isn't viewed except during the holidays. James Stewart delivers a timeless performance as George Bailey, the richest man in the world. Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore and Henry Travers (Clarence) are perfect, Frank Capra skillfully reveals the essence of honor, love and charity, and the closing scene still brings a tear. A masterpiece, any time of the year.

Paying attention to those who do the fighting -- and too often the dying -- in the nation's wars has been a hallmark of Gates' time at the Pentagon. Though brought in by President George W.

"Oil companies are turning to increasingly costly-to-produce oil," says Michael T. Klare, author of The Race For What's Left: The Global Scramble for the World's Last Resources. He points to tar sands in Canada, deepwater reserves off Brazil or so-called tight oil that's extracted from shale formations by hydraulic fracturing in the U.S.
The key advantage of long-term designations, according to planners, is that they offer stability and certainty to property owners, investors and local governments. A school district can decide where to build the next school, or a city the next sewer line, based on where growth will occur, for example. A farmer, assured that development won't intrude for decades, can decide to put in a crop that may take years to grow.

The Suns, who have held five of their seven opponents to fewer than 100 points this season, did a superb job of forcing Aldridge out of the paint and making him take contested shots. They also bottled up Gerald Wallace. After looking so dominant against the Lakers, Wallace finished with just one point and missed all six of his field goal attempts. It was like a rerun of the Blazers' loss to the Clippers, when Wallace was held scoreless.
"We don't need to be paternalistic. We need to give victims choices," Knecht said. "The process for victims is sometimes more important than the outcome."

That strikes me as more than reasonable. Some data brokers (along with all credit bureaus) will sell you access to your own information, but that feels a bit like extortion to me. If it's my information, it should be available to me at any time, as often as I want, for no cost and without any strings, gimmicks or sales pitches.
But instead of housing something for after the game, this red trunk carried binders and binders and binders loaded with info to help during the game. One morning in Arizona, former Cardinals bench coach Joe Pettini was digging through this crate – which was labeled "DUNCAN" – and pulling out three hold-punched sheets with intricate notes and drawings on them. He was updating the binders from a vast filing system of players. There were sheets for players who had long since retired, and yet they were there just in case, say, Bobby Bonilla popped up at third base for the Houston Astros one day.

The hearing was convened by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who is pushing legislation, the Fairness for Struggling Students Act, which would allow students who borrowed from private lenders for their education to wipe out that debt in bankruptcy proceedings, just as credit card borrowers and many other unsecured debtors may do. In 2005, Congress changed bankruptcy laws and made private student loan debts nondischargeable in bankruptcy, with few exceptions.

But looming large before the November election is the SFJazz project. Once it is complete, Anderson hopes to delve back into writing, perhaps in the Hammett apartment at Post and Hyde streets. The view out the fourth-floor window is nearly the same today as it was in the late '20s. Even though the city has grown larger, the cars and fire engine sirens creating big-city clamor outside, there is something soothing about the space, with light streaming through wheat-colored curtains. Visitors are lulled into the feeling they've stepped back in time.

This batch of songs is considerably more diverse - look at all that country! - than what we've seen in the umpteen other discussions of what's on the prez's iPod through the years. In 2010, Obama confessed to having about 2,000 songs on his 'Pod, including Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, Miles Davis, John Coltrane and "a lot of R&B." Previously, the president gave England's Queen Elizabeth an iPod as a gift, pre-loaded with songs such as "God Save the Queen" by the Sex Pistols and, of course, "Killer Queen" by Queen.

One of the joys of JAW is getting to watch the actors (most of whom are two plays during the festival) inhabit such different roles on the same weekend, or even on the same day. For example, Kate Eastwood Norris played a proper (if unusually inquisitive) Victorian English woman in Naomi Iizuka's "Concerning Strange Devices From the Distant West." On the next day, she was hilarious as a flirty, trashy hair-flipping single mom in Stephanie Timm's "On the Nature of Dust," and at least a couple of regular audience members didn't recognize her as the same actress.

There is also a representational piece showing the rooftop view from the artist's studio, which took me back to my own childhood in Santa Monica, an era I remember more in feelings of warmth than I do in specific images.

We had a sumptuous appetizer platter that could have been a meal by itself, plus entrées of fish in a delicate mole sauce and a lush, fruit-studded pork loin. The bar also made a huge impression, with a blood-orange margarita that might be the single best drink I have ever tasted - elegant, tangy and obscenely colorful.

Either the Cooley model or the more sweeping reform is preferable to the draconian way the law is still enforced in some other counties: After two violent or serious felonies, a third strike is a third strike and carries with it a 25-years-to-life sentence, even if that third conviction was for trying, and failing, to swipe a corn dog off a picnic table. That dumb-on-crime approach may be what a pandering Legislature and panicking voters had in mind when they adopted three strikes, twice, in 1994, although there is little evidence to tie the law to a drop in crime that began three years earlier. With three strikes in place, crime rose gain — and then dropped again.

There are perhaps 10 or so underutilized parcels available at this time in Pacifica. Developed prudently, these parcels could be an excellent source of funding for the foreseeable future. If we fail to utilize these parcels to their highest and best uses, Pacifica will continue to struggle financially.

Obesity is based on the body mass index, a calculation using height and weight. A 5-foot, 9-inch (1.75-meter) adult who weighs 203 pounds (92 kilograms) would have a BMI of 30, which is considered the threshold for obesity.
Brickbauer, who worked on the farmhouse addition with Chris Daly, said he quickly concluded that the best approach would be to create a glass-and-steel addition to replace the older family room.

But the relatively modest dimensions keep it from overpowering the rest of the house.

So although I was heartened by Komen's turnaround — on Rachel's behalf and, as a 15-year survivor of breast cancer myself, on my own — it's not enough. Not nearly. In fact, that controversy ought to motivate us to dig deeper, to push harder to understand how the money so generously and, frankly, blithely donated to breast cancer causes is spent. Consider, for instance a new report by Reuters on how Komen distributed its funds in 2011: 15% went toward research — roughly half the percentage allocated in 2008 — even as the foundation's revenue went up. The research allotment also lagged behind fundraising and administrative costs.

The implications for returning to what economists call "full employment" are significant. According to calculations by Michael Greenstone of the Hamilton Project, if the labor force grows by 90,000 a month, then an economy creating 200,000 jobs a month would take about eight years to return to full employment. If the labor force grows by 125,000 a month -- plausible if discouraged workers begin returning to the labor force -- it will take almost 14 years to return to full employment.
Dozens of big programs, including Penn State, recruited Jacquemain, but he decided early his senior year to attend Akron. It was close to home, and he had a chance to play right away.

The NCAA has granted Carlisle eligibility for the 2012 season. "Very unfortunate," Kiffin said of the injury. "We're happy for him that he got cleared to play this year. ... At least [the injury] happened early enough where he'll be back." ... USC is hoping the NCAA similarly grants defensive back Josh Shaw immediate eligibility after transferring from Florida to be closer to family. Shaw is in school and attending workouts but will be sidelined because of a rib injury suffered while lifting weights, Kiffin said.

This summer, the club needs to raise $200,000 to keep its doors open into the fall. That's no small chunk of change. Many of the people who use the clubs don't always have the means to make donations, but others in Harford County do. I would encourage anyone who can to make a donation to the club, no matter how much. Every little bit helps, and you'll be helping the children of Harford County, many who desperately need it.

For the main course, the Chicken Adana was a savory twist on the usual kebabs, with chopped chicken mixed with ground bell peppers, reshaped and cooked on skewers, with a sprinkling of paprika. The Vegetarian Stew, one of several vegetarian offerings, was a tasty mix of seasonal (somewhere) carrots, beans and squash sauteed and served in balsamic vinegar with fluffy rice. Both were served with crispy-fresh pita bread, (more) yogurt and red-pepper dips.

While a handful of states have taken advantage of the special federal waiver program, it's unusual for a county hospital to take the lead.

The loss of that revenue would be particularly problematic for the city of Houston. In 2012, it expects to receive about $86 million in GMPs. About $50 million of this will be used in the general fund to pay for about 500 employees working in the Public Works Department on street projects. Filling a $50 million hole in an already challenging budget would not be easy.

Still, movie critics insist on weighing in. They have to earn their pay, after all, by dropping references to Tarantino and the score. So here are excerpts from some reviews:
As a profession, we should have taken the opportunity to discuss these matters with you and your dad before you were faced with end-of-life decisions -- alone. We could have helped you and your dad set out a clearer plan for when it's time to let go, as an alternative to the last-minute, do-everything experience you went through.
I wish I could say that the film operates at full power throughout, but at the finale it sputters. The story slowly reveals a satirical edge that gives it political force, builds thrill-ride momentum, then hits a dead end. Still, like a Formula 1 racer that blows its engine as it crosses the finish line, it's a helluva show.
Take your child with you to your dental appointments from a young age. Sitting on your lap or getting to sit in the dental chair without being a "patient" will ensure dental appointments are a positive experience for your child. Dentistry is a healing experience and should not be traumatic.

Most days it can feel like if we only had enough time, we could do a much better job at being healthy. Sound familiar? We’d have enough time for a proper breakfast; we’d have time to pack a healthy lunch and prepare a nourishing dinner; we’d carve out downtime for ourselves plus time to connect with friends and loved ones; and time for exercise. Yet we usually end up cutting corners for our well-being throughout the day, but still end up spending ever more hours in front of the computer and television out of exhaustion, lack of energy or seeking a way to connect.

Pat Yasinskas, ESPN.com: "Jackson instantly gives the Bucs a drawing card. That's something desperately needed in a town where you see more people wearing replica jerseys of Evan Longoria, of baseball's Rays, and Steven Stamkos, of hockey's Lightning, than you see wearing Josh Freeman jerseys. Jackson's presence could help the Bucs sell tickets at Raymond James Stadium, where only two home games have been sold out in the past two seasons. Fans might have reason to show up because Jackson is more than just a name. As a football player, he seems like the perfect complement for Freeman, the quarterback who struggled mightily in his third year."

In this interpretation, the Book of Revelation was part of an early power struggle among Jesus' believers, an internecine conflict defined by stark terms of good and evil, faithfulness and apostasy, salvation and damnation.

Still, despite this looseness of interpretation, “L.A. Raw” makes a cogent argument for figurative art as a potent reminder of both our frailty and our humanity. Of course, images of the body are not the only places where that can happen, but they are perhaps the most immediate and accessible. Seeing a body creates an immediate awareness of one’s own body, one’s own position. And whether we like it or not, we must acknowledge the relationship.

At Breckenridge, the resort got bashed on its Facebook page for fencing off one area near a terrain park and having ski patrollers use fake radar guns to scare some skiers and snowboarders into slowing down.

1. L.A. Confidential (1997) Ed Exley: My favorite film of the last 15 years, this detective noir about corruption and vice in the City of Angels gets better with each watching, and even with a cast that included Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger and Danny De Vito, it is Pearce who serves as the axis on which all action revolves. Director Curtis Hanson directed a true gem.
His career touched on some of the most important music made in the '60s and '70s.

4) Eli Roth's Hostel: Hunting Season -- The extreme gore maze starts in a queue where a pair of prostitutes invite you into a European youth hostel with a terrible, dark secret. Among my favorite scenes: the twitching upside-down victim spurting "blood" at visitors, the crazed guy emerging from beneath a pile of body parts and the barking dog puppets popping out of a hallway wall. My only complaint: At times, the Hostel maze felt like just another installment of the Saw maze from the previous two years. Just like the Alice Cooper maze, hit Hostel early in the evening before the crowds descend to the lower lot.

A word of caution: Weather at the Point Reyes National Seashore can be unpredictable. Spring is windy, which can drive the temperature down 20 degrees at the beaches. Fog can be so dense on some summer days that driving is almost impossible on parts of the peninsula. November and December bring high winds, and it may rain for days. Fall boasts the best weather, but conditions can shift quickly. Dress in layers, and bring an extra jacket just in case.

Few contemporary American poets can lay a better claim to the mantle of a poet of poise than Powell. Yes, his poems are fidgety, but fidgety with a veil of decorum. Strike me down for saying it, but he writes in a style that might best be described as hipster gravitas. That first characteristic -- the hipsterness and edginess -- is one reason that since his first book of poems came out in 1998 Powell has been celebrated by the most vapid criteria in American poetry today: quirkiness.

A national poll conducted by Lake Research Partners and Bellwether Research & Consulting in fall 2011 found that only 7 percent of young men and 3 percent of young women do not want to be insured.

Kennedy, just days before the court hears the 26-state challenge to Obama's healthcare law.
