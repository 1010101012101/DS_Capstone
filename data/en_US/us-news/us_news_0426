“I thought the guy (Torres) didn’t hit him like in the head or use his stick at all, or his elbow,” Esposito said. “He hit him in the upper torso by the shoulder. What he did was he embellished it by propelling himself by coming off his feet. If he had kept his feet, he would have hit him, but not nearly as hard and I don’t think there would have been any damage. It’s a bad move, so he deserves (the suspension).

Or everybody. The Chinese gangs aren't the only ones who want the number. So does the Russian mob, as well as a big chunk of the NYPD. Everyone is crooked, everyone is on the take, everyone is selling out to someone, which leads to double crosses and surprises. Kind of hard to keep up with all the neck snapping and pistol whipping.

"We either need to find a home or look at our entire calendar and do something," Cox said. "We've got this problem with the Big Ten (the tournament returns to Bankers Life in 2014), and it's not going away. It'll be open for a year. Do I bring it in for a year and move it again? I think that's hurting our tournament."
Again, winning will matter. It's not going to happen next season, necessarily, but the Hornets have two lottery picks and some cap space. But it's an exciting time down in New Orleans, where they have a new New Orleans thing to talk about between po' boy bites.

PRESSURE ON CONGRESS
A dream landscape emerged as our dinghy sped through turquoise waters toward the uninhabited South Seas islet of Tapu. Here, on a triangular speck of sand and coconut palms at the bottom of the world, red hibiscus, white gardenia and yellow plumeria blossoms were strewn on the water at land's edge. As we stepped from the boat, a sommelier offered flutes bubbling with Dom Perignon. Behind him, china and crystal sparkled on a dining table positioned in shallow water at the edge of the lagoon. A French sous-chef, wearing a tall white toque, worked nearby, partly hidden behind a grill disguised by palm fronds.

Anything that you can do an advance of Thanksgiving Day is a good idea, and prepping your vegetables is a no-brainer. You don't want to pre-cut them too far in advance, as that can affect the flavor, but vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts and green beans require blanching to par-cook them.

Game of Shadows is a buddy movie, too, in which the women are pushed to one side (or literally pushed from a train) so Holmes and Watson, casting admiring gazes at one another, can trade badinage and banter. The fact that Downey's Holmes finds an excuse to doll up in a woman's frock, curls and rouge only adds to the, um, buddyness of the proceedings. (Not that there's anything wrong with that, as they used to say on Seinfeld.) And so there's no place for the just-betrothed Mary Watson (Kelly Reilly), nor for the first movie's femme fatale Irene Adler (the impossibly un-fatale Rachel McAdams), who makes an early exit here. Noomi Rapace, the original Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish adaptations of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, has some serious action cred of her own, though, so she's allowed to tag along with the boys. She's Madam Simza, a soothsaying Gypsy whose brother is somehow involved with Moriarty.

Every five years or so, we get the opportunity to debate what kind of food system we taxpayers want to support. In 2008, after more than a year of public debates, some modest nods to sustainable agriculture found their way into the bill, including changes to farm subsidy programs, support for farmers markets and beginning farmers, and soil and water conservation programs. There may be no such debate this time. It is possible that a farm bill renewal will be included in the package that the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction is supposed to present to the entire Congress this week. That's because the bipartisan leaders of the agriculture committees in both the House and the Senate have submitted an entire piece of legislation to the so-called "supercommittee." But not even other members of Congress will know what's in this "secret farm bill" until that panel submits its recommendations -- which must receive an up-or-down vote without any amendments. It's also not yet clear whether the supercommittee members will even entertain such a detailed submission to their long-term debt-reduction plan.
Limited government also means effective government. When government takes on too many tasks, it usually doesn’t do any of them very well. It’s no coincidence that trust in government is at an all-time low now that the size of government is at an all-time high.

For nearly 20 years, Georgia Dorsey served as housekeeper, cook, caretaker and confidante to three neighboring families in middle-class Monmouth County. For the eight children she looked after from 1958 to the late 1970s, Dorsey, a heavy-set African-American woman who wore what the kids fondly recall as a “terrible” wig, was family: a patient, warm-hearted woman with a fondness for “her stories” — soap operas — and a miraculous way with fried chicken.

Oregon's coast is still wild enough to be a windy wonder, tame enough for the squeamish, surprisingly affordable and uncrowded -- yet diverse enough to please at least someone in the car most of the time. All beaches are public, and access is guaranteed by law. Because the coastal highway didn't go in until the 1930s, much of the coast remains relatively free of commercial development and some is scarcely developed at all, although that is changing.

And yet, their pioneering blend of ska-punk, P-Funk, reggae, soul and heavy metal made enough of an impression that when filmmakers Lev Anderson and Chris Metzler went looking for insights into what made Fishbone matter in "Everyday Sunshine: The Story of Fishbone," they managed to turn up an A-list of fans who did enjoy that kind of mainstream breakthrough. Ice-T, Gwen Stefani, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, George Clinton, Branford Marsalis, ?uestlove and Perry Farrell, the Jane's Addiction frontman who put them on Lollapalooza in 1993, are a few of the higher-profile names that turn up in the documentary.

As someone who lived in Aloha for 20 years (up until about 6 months ago), I agree, more sidewalks and bike lanes would help a lot. Do things to make Aloha more walkable. Maybe encourage more retail to mix into the residential neighborhoods - could be a very cheap way to encourage walkability. Look at the food card explosion in Portland and learn from it - maybe not just food carts, but allow restaurants in houses in neighborhoods. I always thought that it would be cool to have little farmer's markets spread all around - let people set up fruit & veggie stands in their large front yards. Yes it sounds strange, but lets experiment in ways that don't cost much of anything.

The report had especially harsh words for the 81-year-old Mr. Murdoch—although the rebuke divided members of the committee along party lines. "Rupert Murdoch did not take steps to become fully informed about phone-hacking," according to a passage inserted despite the opposition of Conservative members. "He turned a blind eye and exhibited willful blindness to what was going on in his companies and publications." The corporate culture "permeated from the top," it added.

I used to sew some clothes for myself and children until used clothing became less expensive. Nowadays, my machine is used mostly for mending. I even turn worn collars and replace zippers. I've saved fabric scraps, which allows me to make my own patches to cover worn knees in pants and elbows on shirts and sweaters. By treating stains immediately, I lengthen the life of clothing and sheets. I also darn socks. I keep them in a bag, and whenever my husband is driving on a trip, I use that time for darning. I'm happy when I can continue using what I already have. My black leather purse has served me for years, but last year the lining was totally worn out (duct tape was no longer adequate), and the leather looked shabby. I took out the lining and used it to trace new lining on a piece of black nylon from an old umbrella. After sewing that in, I re-dyed the leather. The year I was cleaning out my dad's workroom after he died, I found a parcel wrapped in heavy plastic. Upon opening it, I found a note saying, "Save for repairs." It was one-piece wool underwear with one leg cut off. I cut it off at the waist and have been using the top as a vest for winter sports.

As those who attended his public performances report, he was also a bit of a ham.

In a memoir, former Newsweek editor Osborn Elliott described Emerson as "a great, rangy, bodacious man who flapped his arms when he walked and enchanted when he talked" and who "launched a tradition of sharp and sensitive Newsweek reporting from the South."
The 12-member jury convicted Elwell of accepting the bribe, but acquitted him on the two remaining charges, conspiracy to commit extortion and attempted extortion.
Worse yet, despite all his talk about a moral obligation to slash deficits and cut the national debt, the only reason the GOP's budget can claim to do so is because Ryan assumes future revenue and spending levels that are little more than pure fantasy. "Absurd and impossible," The Atlantic's Derek Thompson called it.
The inquiry is looking at bribes or kickbacks Levey allegedly gave to McCoy in exchange for city contracts with Cale -- accusations that were repeatedly raised by McCoy's subordinates and led to an internal city investigation three years ago.

But what we really needed at the end of the tasting, which included pizzas and two fairly awful French onion soups, was a whole lot of water. Despite being fresher than the typical TV dinners and grab-and-go items, all of the salt left us feeling thoroughly parched. After all, Raley's cheese tortellini carries 1,460 milligrams of sodium per 10-ounce bowl.

Even without strategic default, there's a market impact: Those in the negative-equity crowd are stuck where they are, unless they bring money to the settlement table, convince their bank to approve a short sale or turn the home into a rental. (More on that in Sunday's paper.)
Wouldn't it be great if life came with a manual? Even better would be a guidance system that would keep us on track, so that we could reach our goals and our ultimate destination with faith, integrity and hope.

Coats got the worst of it. His left ear swelled to three times its normal size. He had to keep his hands elevated above his heart to stop the throbbing.

"I think it's a pretty tough road ahead of them," said Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Whitmore. "At some point, they come to the end of the rope of IP litigation, and these businesses that are generating huge losses operationally have to stand on their own."

"In the beginning I had no idea what the whole would be," said Branum, lead architect on the job. "The remodel was an evolution and I wanted to make sure it would be consistent with the existing home and site."
Instead of booyahs for buh-byes, the celebrity coaches try offering bon mots of encouragement to those they have just shed like excess tonnage from their team. Blake Shelton promised at the top of the show that "It's going to get brutal," and maybe it will be for the coaches. That's why some of that brutality should come directly from them. But don't worry, we'll provide the backstabbin' knife-twistin' turns of phrases ourselves.

* Roger's Long, Strange Trip: Of all the characters I thought we'd see try LSD this season, Roger was last on the list. But here he is, with Jane, at a dinner party with windbag intellectuals that turns into an LSD party. Hard to know what was more disturbing -- Jane's amazingly ornate hairdo and earrings, which made her look like one of the outer space temptresses from the original "Star Trek," or Roger staring at himself in the mirror and seeing his hair as a black/silver two-tone. In the tradition of actual '60s movies depicting acid trips, this sequence went on for a self-indulgently long time. The point of it all was to get Roger and Jane to admit that they both know the marriage is over, a revelation I wish would have arrived sooner. We've seen so little of Jane, and know so little about their marriage, that there wasn't much emotional payoff in this development, anyway.
Then it was on to the southern Algarve region. We avoided the developed beach resorts, choosing instead to stay a few minutes inland at Duas Quintas, a beguiling bed-and-breakfast in a converted farmhouse surrounded by rolling hills and fields.

Unions say Christie’s cap will cause layoffs and prevent workers from getting any raises at all, because pay boosts would be swallowed up by the rising costs of health care, energy, inflation and other mandates. Christie, though, shrugged off a record-breaking protest Saturday at the Statehouse and said the show of force had "absolutely no effect" on him. The Republican governor said he hoped the 30,000 to 35,000 protesters "had a good time, and I hope that it helped to spur Trenton’s economy."

His narrative moves along lines of three contrapuntal melodies, each with its own tonal colors. There is a family saga, a lament as Shadid reimagines his family's life in Lebanon and their eventual displacement to America after the Ottoman Empire collapsed at the end of World War I; an often humorous tale of his effort to rebuild the house, dealing with diva-like craftsmen, quirky relatives, an unstable political situation and town gossips, who whisper that he's a CIA spy; and there is Shadid's struggle to reconnect to his family's history, a kind of pilgrim's progress toward bayt, which means "house" in Arabic but connotes community, a sense of belonging.
"This is a conservative state, and it's still building off that tea party movement" that surged in recent years, said Republican strategist Bill Miller. "It's got real roots here, and they are dug in and demanding that candidates be the most conservative."

The hotel's split personalities emerge again at the 2-year-old spa, where the staff exudes the gentle manners of fairy godmothers but the can-do determination of army generals. An example: When trying to schedule a massage ($140 for one hour), the spa manager took the initiative to schedule one for me that wouldn't conflict with dinner. Don't bother, I said; the restaurant is booked. Undaunted, she called and secured a dinner reservation and called me to confirm it.

Nothing's worked. Not the clamp on federal timber sales that hammered Oregon's mill towns. Not the lawsuits or the listing as an endangered species. The belated work to retain and restore its favored old-growth habitat will take decades to unfold. Twenty plus years of trying to save the northern spotted owl and it's still slipping away.
"I understand where he's coming from," Bryant said. "The first thing you want to do if you want to get the best out of your players is you have to understand what they're feeling, you have to understand where they're coming from and what they want to accomplish. That's why it’s not that big of a deal to me. You don't see me sitting here tripping or sweating or anything like that. I've been there."

"I relate to Pirate Captain a lot, actually. He is the boss of this crew of misfits, just as I was the director of this crew of misfits. I acted out a lot of the film through him. In the early days of production, before Hugh Grant came on board to do the voice, I did the voice so we had some working sketches to use. I would act it out to show how I want the line performed physically, the cadence of the line and the gestures. In this scene, Captain is saying, 'Well, come on, explain yourself.' He is actually saying the 'well' of 'well, go on.' The shape of the mouth is more derived from Hugh's delivery."

This assessment should certainly bode well for Oratory, sheer numbers can be essential to picking up extra points in meets and often is a deciding factor between a win and a loss.

Greenwald then challenged Gov. Chris Christie’s proposal to have employees pay 30 percent of their medical insurance premiums. He said the governor’s plan does nothing to control prices, instead it just “shift costs.”

Hospitals will have to pay more attention to lowering costs, not just attracting more patients. "It's all changing," he said. "It just hasn't changed yet."

To be fair, the book's source material isn't great literature either. James initially wrote her book as fan fiction, an outright homage to the "Twilight" series and its inexplicably retrograde take on sexual politics. A quick refresher course: Ostensibly Cool, Smart Girl Meets Sexy Vampire Dude; Girl is both repelled by and inexorably drawn to Sexy Vampire; Girl, immediately following her graduation from high school (high school!), gives in to her darkest urges and marries Sexy Vampire.

He can rattle off his son's achievements, apologizing as he goes for sounding boastful. Two years ago, Keith became an Eagle Scout. He graduated high school this summer, his father buying him a custom-fit suit for the occasion. He's good at spelling. And miniature golf. He does not talk much, preferring to telegraph his speech through simple words or gestures. But his father can glean more than enough from one of his son's gleeful thumbs-ups.
The lord of the title isn’t a heavenly figure, but a local resident, John Haynes Lord, a founder of the Second National Bank (long merged out of existence).

Now, I have to bring my 'A' game every time or get made a fool of by a 21 year old kid.
