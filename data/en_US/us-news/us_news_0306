This Judd Apatow production, partly shot last spring in Ann Arbor, is scattered and overlong, and even the inherent likability of stars Jason Segel and Emily Blunt doesn't make up for the pervasive sense of strain. He plays Tom, a chef in San Francisco. She's Violet, his fiancée, whose decision to work on her doctorate at the University of Michigan delays their wedding. Tom isn't nearly as enamored of snowy Ann Arbor as he pretended to be at first, and he's further stalled when Violet is asked to stay and do postdoctorate work. If this all sounds like a drag, it is. The movie finally finds some much-needed whimsy at the absolute end. But by then, it's too late. Rated R; sexual content, language. 2 hours, 4 minutes. By Christy Lemire.

According to a person involved with the process, the auction had been expected to take place Wednesday. Blackstone had asked the parties to submit sale contracts last week and deliver their initial offers by Tuesday morning, since approval of the bidders from Major League Baseball was expected to come easily on Tuesday afternoon.

This type of program tends to focus on skills for one activity, rather than providing the community in a traditional camp, where a child can excel in one activity or another. A specialty camp will not necessarily provide counselors to take care of a homesick child. Coaches and instructors are there to teach skills, not necessarily teach your child to make a friend. Therefore, I recommend younger kids attend these programs with a friend.

A: Normally you would be right about putting the trees and shrubs on different valves and schedules if you were using truly drought-tolerant trees. However the Sisso and Brazilian pepper trees need more water and are actually compatible with the shrubs. So your landscaper is correct on the watering, although you should consider putting a higher capacity emitter on the trees (or smaller on the shrubs) so everything will receive water to the needed depth. Once the trees are well-established, then consider adding another valve or altering the schedule. Abstain from pruning the trees for at least a year until the root systems are established, no matter how the trees look.

The unauthorized camping ordinance will reinforce Denver's effort to protect its public spaces, and will do so in a much more humane way than ordinances in other cities. In the language of this ordinance are provisions identical to those of the "Sit & Lie" ordinance passed in 2005 (which restricts individuals from sitting or lying on sidewalks in the downtown area). The language requires that police first warn the camper and, if necessary, solicit medical or human-services attention for him or her prior to issuing a citation.

Another concern: Hedge funds borrowing cheap money can magnify their bets, taking a loan at 2 percent to buy a security that's rising 10 percent. They sell the security, pay off the bank and pocket the rest. That's true whenever interest rates remain low. Falling rates allow speculators to borrow larger amounts. In the extreme, losses from hedge funds and other borrowers can put their banks at risk and leave governments to clean up the mess.

Bisazza, the Italian firm famous for its mosaics, also broke with conventional wisdom when it launched the minimal, really-doesn't-say-bathroom-at-all "Nendo Collection," designed by the Japanese architect Oki Sato, at the Milan Furniture Fair last week. The collection of 44 wooden and ceramic pieces (still unpriced) includes a wooden-framed, weightless basin, freestanding storage units, stools and even a plant rack. You could be forgiven for thinking you were at a sculpture exhibition. "In the past, Japanese bathrooms were a place for communication. Families bathing together, as well as public baths, were very common until a few decades ago," says Mr. Sato, adding that he hopes this collection will revive the tradition.

Probably the fastest player in football right now and we all look forward to the future with him, but his two runs were not necessarily turning points in the game.

R.E.M.'s first steps as members of the major label establishment were tentative ones: despite spawning hit singles, "Green" (1988) and "Out of Time" (1991) lacked both the focus and the fire of the band's earlier work.

The album, a series of profound meditations on mortality and perseverance, aches from the first winding riff of opener "Drive" to the final lingering notes of closer "Find the River."

Don Hill's was home to several long-running parties, which were basically the nightclub equivalent of regular weekly or bi-weekly programming. The organizers of the influential SqueezeBox party sought a middle ground between the punk rock and drag queen subcultures, and ended up creating something singular under the Manhattan moon. It became a place where roughnecks in Mohawks would dance with transvestites, go-go boys would dance shirtless on the club tables, and everybody would have a good, blissed-out time (though many wouldn't remember it the following morning.)

Failing schools: Both sides agree on the need to close ineffective schools. But how? The district wants the freedom to reassign all staff and start anew; the union wants to make sure that good teachers in bad settings aren't tossed aside.

Feinstein, McCormack and a coalition including business leaders and environmentalists are trying to raise more than $1 billion over the next decade to build new levees and restore wetlands that would protect the Bay.
