My first adventure is to explore Masjid al-Nabawi, or the "Mosque of the Prophet," the second-holiest site in Islam. It was built in 622 A.D. by the Prophet Muhammad and his companions after they migrated from Mecca to escape persecution.

Since then, Masjid al-Nabawi has been greatly expanded and is now one of the largest mosques in the world.

Avenue of the Giants: I love the off-season along the winding road north of Garberville. Here the pavement doesn't cut through the forests like the modern version of Highway 101 it criss-crosses. The lanes meander between thousands-years-old coastal redwoods that tower over the ferns and fallen trees below.

“I assume that people meant what they said when they said it,” Obama said at a White House news conference. “That's been at least my practice.

Best of all, unlike the journeys undertaken by my naturalist heroes, my trip involved no sacrifice of creature comforts. Mindo, a town of about 15,000, and its environs are filled with a variety of hotels, from basic to luxury.

What will the Supreme Court do on this issue if it decides to review the case? Everyone on both sides of the issue expects that it will be a 5-4 decision with Justice Anthony Kennedy in the majority. In predicting his vote, it must be remembered that there have been two Supreme Court cases in history advancing rights for gays and lesbians; both were written by Kennedy. And both emphasized the absence of a legitimate government purpose for discriminating based on sexual orientation. From these opinions, it is easy to see him coming to exactly the same conclusion as the 9th Circuit: There is no legitimate interest served by rescinding the right to marriage equality in California.

Cocaine consumed him, and Baldwin's reputation became a mess: a tangle of sweaty public appearances, suspicious car accidents, overdoses and arrests. He kept acting, and cycled in and out of various rehab programs, but as his choice of roles diminished, Baldwin had no choice but to play the role of the man torn between celebrity and destruction. Then he hit bottom again in 2006, and this time the trip to rehab seemed to do the trick.

I hope the law is more consumer friendly than the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FRCA), which gives consumers the right to an annual free copy of their credit reports from the three major bureaus: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. It's a great law but when you ask for your annual report, you're likely to get a sales pitch, such as the one I got with my free TransUnion report. It offered me "instant access to my FREE credit score" that would cost me $29.95 a month after my "free trial."

Tressel, who guided Ohio State to its first national championship in 34 years after the 2002 season, was pressured to resign after 10 years with the Buckeyes. The NCAA hit him with a five-year "show-cause" order which all but prevents him from being a college coach during that time.

The first thing we did was we started doing everything in-house. A lot of the guys were doing their own private instructions, they were doing their own pivate lifting sessions and it was great for the individual, but I felt it was horrible for the team atmosphere as far as the way we needed to come together. In the fall, we were at nine guys at the workouts, and by mid-winter, we had 65 guys. And it was one of those things where I could see they felt awful if they were going to miss one. We weren't telling them they had to be there, but it was more like: "If you want something out of the spring, it takes some work." So that was neat to see that evolve early on -- that it's not always about the individual, it's about us as a program. And they all worked out together, too, which I felt was important. They were seeing that it's not just freshmen, junior varsity and varsity teams, but a program that everybody is invested in it. The other thing we spent a lot of time on was getting alumni back invested. We felt there was a huge disconnect. We don't want this to be a Spalding thing for four years and then you're done. We want to make sure people understand that this is an investment for life. We've been getting alumni coming back to games, having receptions here and it's been awesome. So we really have kind of looked at the past, present and future and analyzed where we're at in all those phases.

The U.S. has been pushing allies to tighten the squeeze on Iran, whose nuclear program has aroused international fears. The U.N., the U.S. and the European Union began enacting new sanctions on Tehran in June. U.S. and European officials have said in recent weeks that they believe sanctions are exacting a growing toll on Iran. The Iranian currency dropped nearly 10% in October, as Iranian traders scrambled to obtain dollars. Iran's largest shipping company defaulted on over $500 million in debt in recent months as international insurers have refused to underwrite their cargoes.

The only person I could think of who might have recently seen the man in the car was the rector of St. David’s Church. I have seen that man sitting at the back left side of the church on the few occasions I attend a Sunday service. I often see him driving south on Roland after church on Sundays.

There were a few minor traffic accidents in the city, Hicks said. A fatal crash occurred Saturday outside the city, north on State Road 19 in the Ocala National Forest. However, it was unclear whether Bruce L. Pelish, 57, of Miramar, was heading to or had left the bike rally when his motorcycle struck a deer, Hicks said.

Whatever the situation, do not approach the vehicle or driver. If you see them heading into a wooded area then you should call the State Police and tell them what you saw and that you suspect that they are illegally dumping tires. The illegal dumping of tires costs the taxpayers more than you think. It cost the public works department between $2 and $5 per tire to properly dispose of them. That doesn’t include the man hours expended gathering them. Additionally, time used to collect discarded tires could be better utilized in the maintenance of our roads and other township property.

When the Series shifts to Texas, it twists Allen Craig's way. The Cardinals' second-year outfielder could prove to be a trump in this series because he'll move into the lineup and shuffle, most likely, Lance Berkman to the DH spot. There's the Cardinals' 30-homer bat in the DH spot. But Craig isn't a slouch, some bonus bat wedged into the lineup to satisfy AL rules. He's a hitter who has 12 homers in his past 250 at-bats. In the past four World Series games the Cardinals have played at AL ballparks, they have used the following players at DH: Chris Duncan (to get So Taguchi in the outfield), Scott Spiezio, Reggie Sanders (to get Taguchi in the outfield) and Marlon Anderson. In 2006, Duncan's production is the closest facsimile to Craig's. What awaits Craig in Texas is three lefthanded pitchers. He feasts on lefty starters: .353 average, .765 slug, seven of his 11 regular-season homers, and a

After a seven-game run with his pitcher hitting eighth and a position player ninth, Cardinals manager Tony La Russa is back to the conventional lineup this afternoon with righthander Kyle McClellan batting ninth as he faces the Toronto Blue Jays in the finale of a three-game interleague series at Busch Stadium.
The manager is rarely asked about the best-case scenarios with this team, and there are many. And that’s where the prospect of a healthy Chamberlain, returning to pitch meaningful innings out of the bullpen in August, September and, yes, October, enters in. Imagine the back-end of the Yankees bullpen — already fierce with Rafael Soriano in the seventh and David Robertson in the eighth, ahead of Mariano Rivera in the ninth — with a healthy Chamberlain back in the fold. That’s an incredible lineup of power arms to nail down the final nine, or even 12 outs. Sure, it’s an “if,” but it’s certainly not impossible. The list of pitchers who have returned as good, if not better, from UCL surgery is long. Many of those who have had Tommy John come back better than ever. This could be Chamberlain.

One of the original notebooks, from whence this volume was distilled, contains the entire Morse code, carefully written out on the flyleaf. This is classic Sontag - the lists, one senses, represent her ongoing efforts to decipher a litany of secret codes.

He gets up again and tries to run, but falls down again. Tina reaches the finish line, and her family embraces her. But Tina says, "It was a bittersweet feeling to win," knowing that Corey is on the ground just a few yards away, behind her.

I studied Italian, art and film there. It's a magical city. There are so many wonderful museums, churches and restaurants that I didn't even get to see and do everything in six months!

"I think we're developing more awareness in the Broadway community and it's clear from surveys that we did after the first one that there's an appetite for 'Spider-Man,' there's an appetite for 'Wicked,' there's an appetite for Radio City," Bailey said.

House Bill 369 still represents a sweeping victory for Republicans. In today's politics, there are few sure things. But it is possible, perhaps likely, that next November the GOP will capture 12 of the 16 districts, with just four left to Democrats. That far outstrips Republicans' overall weight in Ohio.

The bill as it passed was watered down in the House, angering some advocates. The House stripped out a provision that would have required people who gather "political intelligence" to register as lobbyists, and left out measures relating to prosecuting corruption.
The name took a lot of thought. I like it because it means hazelnut in French, so it has an Oregon connection. The word also refers to a little thing. We rejected "Hazelnut" since a previous restaurant in this space had a similar name. Another reject name was Wooly Pig -- which refers to a species of pig that produces really nice pork -- but as a name it just didn't sound right.

Nopa is also the moniker of the restaurant from partners Laurence Jossel, his wife, Allyson, and associate Jeff Hanak. They opened Nopa in 2006 in the impressive space of a former bank with the intent of making this a neighborhood gathering spot.

But the Jossel's California-Mediterranean food coming from the dramatic open kitchen with rotisserie and wood-burning oven have made this a destination for food lovers throughout the Bay Area.

Unable to breathe, Spitz said, Smith was afraid of "impending doom," which increased his heart beat. With carbon monoxide buildup inside his lungs and inability to take in oxygen, Smith developed acidosis "that brings on a haywire rhythm of the heartbeat."

The St. Louis Ramswill pick first tonight followed by the Indianapolis Colts. It wouldn’t surprise me after they failed to get stud wide receiver Justin Blackmon in Round One if the Rams take Hill or Randle off the board with the first pick tonight. Then again, the Rams have so many needs, including offensive line, so that’s just a guess on my part.
The council’s vote recommends the DEP grant the project an exemption from the Highlands Act, which severely limits development in a seven-county, 860,000-acre area that supplies water to more than half of the state’s residents.

To him, the staples and sutures were a sign that he had finally received his kidney. And after that, he could feel that the "cloud" — a five-year fog of illness — had lifted. The new kidney immediately began pumping out the toxins from his system.His kidney came from Mary Beth Moynihan. She donated on behalf of her friend John Wincz. She had met him just two years before, she said. But like the anonymous donor, she had always thought about doing something large.
Because of problems with earlier procurements, most notably with the firm AnsaldoBreda, Metro officials welcomed the contract, saying time has been running out for the purchase and delivery of rail cars before new lines are finished. A $300-million deal with the Italian company to build 100 vehicles fell apart in late 2009.

Heat the olive oil in an 8-quart pot over moderately low heat. Add the carrot, celery, leek, tomato, fennel, parsley and thyme. Season with salt and stir to coat with the oil. Arrange the fish bones on top and cook gently without stirring until any meat clinging to the fish bones turns white, about 30 minutes. This slow "sweating" process extracts flavor from the vegetables and makes a sweeter stock.
In conversation, Mr. Brewer, 57, and Mr. Gardner, 39, manage to sound like the calendar says it's 1985. As they describe the corporate-litigation firm, which employs more than 40 lawyers, they evoke a work-hard-play-hard ethos, tossing around hard-driving football analogies to convey that work comes first. And second. "This is a star system," says Mr. Brewer.

Meanwhile, Jeremy and Sandi finally finish making butter, head to the windmill, and then begin the drive to the Pit Stop. As it turns out Laurence and Zac, the father-and-son adventurers, have a really lousy sense of direction. They are hopelessly lost on the Copenhagen freeways and lose any lead they had over Jeremy and Sandi. When they finally arrive at the Pit Stop, it is too late. They are last and are eliminated from the competition. There are now only five teams left racing around the globe for a million dollars.

The House, split 30-30 between Republicans and Democrats, gave final approval Monday to one of Kitzhaber's priorities, a bill that changes the way Medicaid clients get health services.

It seems that because of oil spills, industrial discharges, agricultural runoff, animal waste and sewage (both treated and raw), tap water is far from risk-free. Suddenly, the stainless-steel extraction pipes of Poland Spring don't seem quite so redundant, and Royte admits that after her tap-water investigations, "I'm not immune to the appeal of springwater." Yet the conclusion of "Bottlemania" is more thoughtful than despairing, even though much of what we've learned isn't comforting. If our future really does include drinking reclaimed or "repurified" wastewater, Royte is willing to hold her nose and remain philosophical. "As bad as toilet-to-tap sounds," she concludes, "I have to remind myself: all water is recycled." *

In "Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend," Susan Orlean has fashioned a masterpiece of reporting and storytelling, some of it quite personal and all of it compelling.
