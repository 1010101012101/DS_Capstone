That meant simple roof lines without complicated gables or dormers and in-floor heat on a slab. Forgoing a basement saved money on excavation, concrete and floor-covering costs. "The most economic way to do it is in a concrete slab and then let that be your floors; it's as rudimentary system as you can have," he said.
Who knows? The fact is that many senior Republicans aren't happy about Ryan's Medicare idea. At the very least, they think it's political poison -- the very point that Gingrich seemed to be making when he got carried away and trotted out his "right-wing social engineering" line. That's why Mitch McConnell isn't pushing his GOP senators to back the House budget.
Then on Sunday, my friend Jeff Grabmeier, Whan and two others were birding the Scioto Trail State Park, just about a three-hour drive south of Cleveland, when they found singing hooded and yellow-throated warblers -- another earliest Ohio record.

In recent years, Komen's pink ribbon has become an important symbol, not only because it supports the important work of breast cancer research but also because it represents the empowerment of women whose health concerns have not always been treated as a high priority. The work of Planned Parenthood in protecting women's reproductive rights and helping bring to an end the era of back-alley abortions strikes a similar chord for many Americans.
If there are valid answers, Brinker did not provide them. In the mean time, Planned Parenthood's CEO has been out in front touting her organization's record, noting Komen's funding allows Planned Parenthood to provide 700,000 breast exams to women in need annually.

After a while, a saying was adopted by top administrators for behavior that didn't fit the new standards: That's so 2-and-14, they would say, referring to the Chiefs' win-loss record in 2008. This pertained to matters large and small: Stephanie Melton, who worked 11 years on the team's operations staff, recalled Pioli's reaction after she and a coworker, after working past midnight on a weekend, had parked a courier van in the unmarked space usually occupied by Pioli's car. The women had forgotten to move it, and Pioli was livid the next morning. Melton said she was made to feel for several days that she'd be fired.
High-frequency firms use computers and mathematical formulas to exploit split-penny price differences. High-frequency trading is estimated to account for more than 50 percent of all U.S. stock trading. The firms often employ a practice called "quote stuffing," in which huge numbers of artificial orders to buy or sell are placed and then canceled almost immediately. Regulators say the practice may create the illusion of greater trading volume, potentially allowing sellers to profit from the perception of rising demand.

The two transmissions offer copious amounts of win. Yes, that's right, the six-speed automatic is good. Choosing the six-speed manual is still a no-brainer, but picking the auto isn't a shameful choice. The auto transmission's Sport mode speeds up the automatic shifts to deliver quickness similar to a dual-clutch automatic transmission, but without the awkward off-the-line clutch engagement that's so common among that type. Sport mode intuitively holds gears longer and rev-matches downshifts. Other modes include a standard Snow mode that softens throttle application and starts the transmission in 2nd gear to aid in slippery conditions.

The Royal Navy, which used to protect the Persian Gulf and the world’s other key international waterways, sank into strategic obsolescence half a century ago, thanks to budget cuts like the ones coming for our forces.

Tickets to Kid Cudi's concert at Terminal 5 go onsale at 4:20 on Friday. DO YOU GET IT? Because I do. I value Scott Mescudi's contributions to Kanye's records, but at this point, it no longer matters to me whether he'd begin to rhyme with some semblance of meter, or confidence, if he wasn't stoned. This is because he is up there and he's not coming down. He's like a poorly-inflated mylar balloon, and his raps are the equivalent of a slow helium leak.

With Mr. Gingrich and his characteristic bravado continuing to self-destruct, Mr. Santorum seems an unlikely savior, but his record certainly qualifies as a pure conservative of the sort the party has become across the board. As the GOP lurches ever rightward, the ultimate remorse may be about lurching too far, and alienating the moderate center where elections usually are decided.

Servers suggest that the move from Lake Oswego to Northwest Portland will allow Dang more scope with specials and flashier inspirations. Recent evidence suggests how welcome this could be, with entrees offering truly unexpected elements. Lots of Thai restaurants, for example, do a mixed seafood stir-fry with sweet chili, but few have this tang, and few manage to have each seafood component -- shrimp, scallops, mussel, crispy fish, squid and crab claw -- come through so fresh and sweet. Another special, beef with black pepper, featured tender medallions retaining their meaty, juicy identity even in a pungent situation.

Putting it that way was clever. It made him sound reasonable and moderate. But his phrasing hinted at a Catch-22, because the only way any such system can be proven is to test it, and that requires money. Many feared that under this administration, the unproven would always remain so.

What was needed was a new, bold, forward-thinking system run by experts with access to the most modern techniques. For Wells, the label for such a system mattered less than the imperative that we implement a revolution-from-above. He admired how the Germans, Italians and Russians were getting things done.

Just before the execution began, Selsor, 57, looked at his son and sister. His son reached out his hand.
2. Besides, this is not a Rams' discipline issue. It is an NFL issue. Williams didn't do these things in St. Louis; the Rams' only connection is that Williams is now their employee. But he hasn't coached as much as a single practice yet in St. Louis. If NFL commissioner Roger Goodell does his job in a way that's faithful to his stated and adamant goals for player safety and health, he'll take this out of the Rams' hands, at least for 2012. If Goodell is serious about player safety, he can't cut Williams a break. Especially with the new discoveries coming out of Washington, Buffalo, and, to a lesser extent, Tennessee. Even with Williams throwing himself at the mercy of Goodell's court, the commissioner has to come down hard on Williams and make an example of him.
Designation as a pollution control facility means its property taxes could drop dramatically-which in turn means that local school districts and other taxing bodies get far less money from the facility.
"It was boring," Williams said of his offseason. "But there were a couple exceptions. Bringing Robin on board and the newness of that and the optimism of things I thought we could get accomplished. But not being in the free-agent or trading market as much, it was a strange offseason. It was just different. My phone bill was lower."

If Aldridge makes the final roster, he would become the third player to compete in the Olympics while a member of the Trail Blazers since a 1989 FIBA decision to allow NBA players to participate.

Christie, a first-term governor who has served for less than two years, had been insisting for the last year that he would not run, frequently saying that in his heart he knew the time was not right. He once jokingly suggested that he would have to commit suicide to convince people to stop asking him to run.
"If Ron Paul gets more delegates than Newt Gingrich, then he gets at least as good of a prime-time slot to speak at the convention," Galen said. But, he added, "Ron Paul's not going to be vice president, and he's not going to get a plank in the platform that Romney doesn't want."
"No wonder you produce so many great bands," Martin said as the mass of voices faded out of "Major Minus" in a chorus of "ooh-oohs." Now, there's no way any one group of 15,000-20,000 people sounds any different than another. But whatever. The point is, the Rose Garden was nearly sold out.

In doing so, she had become a statistic herself, one of an increasing number of self-proclaimed rescuers who have become animal hoarders running legal and often nonprofit charities.
But here is where we disagree: When Johnson mentions "interest groups from outside the region," he is referring to big city folks from Portland. We, on the other hand, are referring to Nestlé, a multinational multibillion-dollar corporation based in Switzerland. This is not about an urban/rural divide, as Johnson would have us believe, but about a large corporation dominating a local natural resource.

Many studies have documented summer learning loss. Just last month, the RAND Corp., a California-based national research center, released an extensive study that found students lose the equivalent of a month's worth of instruction during summer break, forcing teachers to retrace a large chunk of the prior school year.

What I also notice as I read the biographies of board members is that only a few have any financial or investment background. Most are selected by union members that they represent, or they are appointed by legislatures that have been elected with union help.

As prosecutors wrapped up their case, they showed the jury records that detailed the money spent to hide Hunter — $319,500 in cash, luxury hotels, private jets and a $20,000-a-month rental mansion in Santa Barbara, Calif.

“We are extremely pleased with Judge McKeon's well reasoned and articulate decision recognizing that Strauss-Kahn is not entitled to immunity,” Diallo’s attorneys Kenneth P. Thompson and Douglas H. Wigdor said in a statement emailed to reporters. “We have said all along that Strauss-Kahn's desperate plea for immunity was a tactic designed to delay these proceedings and we now look forward to holding him accountable for the brutal sexual assault that he committed.”
Films like "Miss Representation" will receive a better fate, Huttner insists, when "more women go to the movies and support women filmmakers. When we vote with our dollars, Hollywood notices. And then this gives more women the chance to express themselves." Citing research by professor Martha Lauzen at San Diego State University, she notes that men write and direct almost 90 percent of all Hollywood films. "The only way an artist gets to make better art is to get more chances to do so," Huttner said. "The only way someone gets better is by practicing their craft."

Aerial photos showed 5,000 watercraft on the 14-lake Whitefish chain last July 4, Shoutz said. At narrow, no-wake channels between lakes, boats stacked up two abreast for hundreds of yards. It was so crowded that the seaplanes of rich lakefront homeowners couldn't find a place to land.

It would be easy for Cyrus to veer into stuffiness, but that doesn't happen. The 60-seat room, with a bar that holds 20 and a private room for 12, isn't the least bit ponderous -- except perhaps for the Austrian shades at the windows, which look as if they belong in a funeral parlor, not a sleek Wine Country restaurant -- and the staff makes a point of keeping things light.

It concludes that they could be issued carrying limited guarantees from governments without changes to the European Union treaty that would require ratification from all 27 EU states.

The works in "The Elusive Narrative" are clearly influenced by the movies. Weems' "Where and When I Enter - Ancient Rome" (2006), in which a woman with her back to us looks out the large, curtained window of a dimly lit room, has the ambiance of a Fellini film. Indeed, the presence of a movie camera in the frame tips us off that we're in the realm of illusion.

Earlier Sunday police made the rounds and recommended residents to move their cars to higher ground.
Our plans for a boycott were also foiled.

We slipped quickly by the candy store to buy our tickets. Ashamed to face Mr. Bilder, we avoided patronizing his business and hastened his demise. One Saturday matinee, I noticed the front door of the candy store was locked, the shade drawn on the door.
A Kraft chef had a pot of Phineas and Ferb on the boil when Mr. Haro walked into the kitchen. (Like all thicker pasta, it takes longer to cook.) While his art works bubbled, he said, "In the lab, we eat mac and cheese 20 times a week. It was exciting in the beginning. A kid once asked me to autograph a box."

He said the district received $7.2 million, or 36 percent, less in both state funding over the past five years and a decline in property tax revenue growth from $2.6 million in 2007 to -$181,000 in 2011. The district currently has $3.5 million in reserves as opposed to $9 million in reserves in 2008.
But that's not likely to happen, thanks to some timely court decisions and a new groundswell by creatives like McIntosh who've learned their rights and are starting to assert them. (A Comedy Central rep wouldn't comment on the Daily Show mashup, but in 2010, a spokesman for both Daily and Colbert said, I can't recall a time we've ever sued a blogger for the use of a Comedy Central clip.)

Though technically set in present day, everything about the film feels as if it was plucked out of the '40s, the heyday of the comic shorts that would cement the Stooges in history, including the clothes, with Curly's always too short and too tight. The film itself is constructed to echo the shorts format, with its three acts unfolding as three distinctly marked episodes, all tied to the orphanage where they're dropped off as babies. Before the last slap and the final "Nyaaaaaahhhhh," there will be an adoption to bungle, an orphanage to destroy and save, a beauty (Sofia Vergara) to distract them, a murder to consider and a brief run at fame.
