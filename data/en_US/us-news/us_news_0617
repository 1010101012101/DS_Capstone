The task-force, co-chaired by Baltimore County's director of economic development and chief administrator for the liquor board readily admit the new plan will eliminate the value of over 400 existing licenses, thereby reducing the value of those businesses, businesses that have already been hard hit by the failed economy and real estate collapse.

But there's so much more to it. Hockey is not so much a cult as a culture. And maybe not a culture so much as a religion. And, like any religion, it has its history, rituals and tradition. There is good (Shane Doan) and evil (Brendan Shanahan). There is temptation and sin. And, in the end, there is redemption (Mike Smith) and a hockey life well spent is rewarded with a drink from a chalice.

2. A Christmas Story (1983): Don't need to say too much about this, but what is Christmas without the adorable Ralphie, the foul-mouthed Mr. Parker and the coveted Red Ryder BB gun? The flat-tire scene and the dinner at the Chinese restaurant still crack me up.

Just let me say here, at my age, it isn't easy because the older you get the harder it is to take it off, sort of like gray hair and wrinkles. Only worse because gray hair and wrinkles can be covered up to some extent, but that stubborn spare tire around the middle and those love handles just expand with the clothes.
The divorce has also sucked Yahoo into the quagmire. Dovey's lawyers served Yahoo and its officials with at least eight subpoenas for emails and records from Decker's reign at the tech company.

In many cases, that reaction is quantifiably justified - a traditional half-gallon-sized carton of ice cream now often holds only 1.75 quarts, for example - but often the feeling comes down to our personal taste, such as with music or movies, or some men's choices of facial hair.

"Little Broken Hearts" little resembles Jones' previous four solo albums, from the vampy cover photo to its lyrical content and vaguely psychedelic sound. It's edgy, effects-laden and deeply personal. She's written a few songs she felt were this personal before, especially on her 2009 album "The Fall." But much of "Little Broken Hearts" centers on her life and the emotions you run through during relationship problems - from betrayal and indecision to healing and moving on.

Without Arnott, the Blues had Vladimir Sobotka centering David Perron and Chris Stewart on the third line. The other changes included a line with David Backes in the middle of Andy McDonald and Matt D'Agostini, and Patrik Berglund centering Alex Steen and T.J. Oshie. The fourth line remained the same with Scott Nichol playing with Jamie Langenbrunner and B.J. Crombeen.

"My heart's not where it needs to be," Pettitte said at a Yankee Stadium press conference announcing his retirement from baseball.
• As Frank Isola of the New York Daily News suggested, the Heat are a much tougher first-round opponent for the Knicks than the top-seeded Chicago Bulls: "Perhaps the Heat did the Knicks a favor by pushing them into eighth, where Anthony and Co. would face a possible first-round series with Chicago. The Knicks at least beat the Bulls once in four meetings this year. Miami completed the three-game series sweep and although Mike Woodson’s team is being touted as a dark horse in the Eastern Conference, the bottom line is that the Knicks are 1-6 against the Bulls and Heat... 'It’ll be a battle,' Anthony said of what potentially lies ahead in the playoffs. 'We feel very confident going against anybody right now, regardless of who it is. Our confidence is sky high. We’ll learn from this game and get better.'”

Hoping, but not entirely convinced, that our experience wasn't a fluke, I returned for a second visit and found that the food was almost as well prepared and creative as before, from the spicy chilled Brandywine tomato soup ($9) with kimchi-like pickled cabbage, to olive oil-poached black cod ($25) with roasted tomatoes and paper-thin slices of zucchini in a black olive and pine nut vinaigrette.

This terrific Vacqueyras from a great year comes from a domaine named for the granite cliffs called Dentelles de Montmirail at the foot of Mont Ventoux. Cézanne country. This 2009 is the southern Rhone at its best, a truly beautiful expression of Grenache with a touch of Syrah and Mourvèdre. Tasting of dark plums, blackberries and sun-baked herbs, it conjures up the landscape of Cézanne's paintings.
But for the Olympia School District, for example, an anticipated shortfall of 56 students translates into about $250,000 less from the state in the coming year.

Q: What is California's record high temperature for March?
Hey, Mike: You are a relentless defender of Mangini. Mangini stated in words, and certainly demonstrated in his actions, that the quarterback was not the most important position on the field. If you examine his five years as head coach -- three with the Jets and two here -- he almost always had quarterback "issues." The really good coaches are really good managers of the quarterback position. I don't believe Mangini is particularly good at managing the position.

For the most part, horrifying bridesmaid dresses are a thing of the past. It could be our over-exposure to them now (with Pinterest, Facebook, and the rest of the internet, we have more access to pictures of bridesmaid dresses, and statistically, the more we see, the more likely we’ll come across acceptable fashion, right?) or it could be that because we’re in a recession, people just can’t afford all that magenta toile.

Alas, there's no local, artisanal vendor option when it comes to needles and seam rippers, says owner Keri Cavanaugh, who has a master's in curation and actually worked at a museum in her former life. But what's a general store without sewing supplies? The notions selection might be mass-produced, but it's useful, and adds to the old-timey aesthetic that's so hot right now.

Generally, residents have embraced the county's two human-services taxes, rejecting only one since the first vote in 1976.

Bon Jovi's elaborate load-in and set-up is expected to take six days. U2 will reprise the in-the-round show that drew a record crowd of 85,000 to old Giants Stadium in September.

After more than 10 years, it may well be time to cut our losses -- especially after the disastrous events of recent weeks: a video purportedly showing Marines urinating on Taliban corpses; the lethal riots that erupted after the mistaken burning of Qurans, and the rampage by an Army staff sergeant, accused of killing 16 civilians as they slept.

øAs a long-term investment, VIX funds don't seem terribly useful. During periods of slow, steady advances - remember them? - a VIX fund won't be of much use. Nor will they help during long, slow declines, which are a fairly normal feature of bear markets. "When people say VIX funds hedge downside risk, they're talking about those 'Oh, crap!' moments," Nadig says.

He served in several roles there, including CEO and chairman of the board.
But there's something about the former Massachusetts governor that makes his millions stand out like a dollar sign branded on his chest, for all his tie-less, unbuttoned-collar and pressed-jeans decor on the campaign trail. It's not like he's some pompous stuffed shirt. He seems nice enough, courteous and generally good-humored when he's not unconvincingly painting Barack Obama as the man who wants to take away your freedom, your liberty and your right to choose your own doctor.
Courtemanche said the soccer league was first focused on expanding to 20 teams, and would likely add a team in New York. This year, Montreal became the league's 19th team -- and the third in Canada. The league has added nine teams in the past eight years, nearly doubling its size.

That's a great description, not just of his ambition but also of his aesthetic: the balance of myth and recollection, the desire to use this landscape as a template against which the human struggle might play out in epic terms. Still, spend a day (or two, as I did last month) or even an hour roaming Oxford and you begin to see how literal Faulkner's vision was.
“The sad part about New Jersey is it does not group units according to the level of functioning,” Zdanowicz said. “So in one unit, you might have someone like my sister, who is very mild and doesn’t speak much, with patients who are delusional or violent, nonintentionally violent — even predatory.”

Under current law, public workers contribute up to 10 percent of their paychecks toward their pensions, and their employers must pay 14 percent. SB 5, if upheld, would bar employees from negotiating pension pickups, a practice by which employers agree to pay a portion of the 10 percent contribution. But the new law would not increase the standard 10 percent contribution.

While runners across the state probably raised an eyebrow when they read that Kauppila had defeated Rock Bridge standouts Wilfong and Nathan Keown, Kauppila shrugged off the significance of the win.
So "Dark Shadows" works two kinds of comedy - comic dislocation and period satire. But wait, there's more. When Barnabas returns to his ancestral home, the lady of the house, his distant relation (Michelle Pfeiffer), makes him promise not to tell the rest of the household that he's a vampire. And so we get a perfect farce setup, in which the audience knows what's going on but most of the characters are only confused, as Barnabas picks up a fork and blithely remarks, "Had this been real silver, my hand would have burst into flame at the slightest touch."

In the same breath, you have to admit, though, that you never expected Ilya Bryzgalov to be the one to steal a game, either. If anything, the Flyers would probably win games and the series in spite of their inconsistent netminder and not because of him.
Cities are sometimes motivated by fear as well. The fear of losing a team threatening to leave is very real when you consider the history of relocations in the NFL. Baltimore to Indy, Cleveland to Baltimore, St. Louis to Arizona, Los Angeles to St. Louis, and Houston to Nashville are just some of the franchises that moved away because a new home awaited elsewhere.

Now crowds head for the penthouse floor, above The Nines hotel, which in turn is above Macy's, formerly Meier & Frank. There they find the recently opened Departure, and it's not just a Pan-Asian restaurant and cocktail scene.

Drawing on the concept of "Duck-on-a-Rock," a game Naismith played as a boy in which players lofted rocks in order to knock other rocks off a base stone, Naismith attached two peach baskets to the opposite ends of a gymnasium ten feet above the floor (a measurement which remarkably holds true today), posted thirteen rules (almost all of which are outdated), and brought out a leather soccer ball (the "dribble" had not yet been invented). On December 21, 1891, the first "Basket Ball" game was played, and the sport that would come to capture the imagination of millions was born.

As a development tool, most of the JAW resources go to the playwrights presented in what's called "The Big Weekend." But the recognition gets spread around a bit with the "Made in Oregon" reading series that kicks off the festival. This year, that included Susan Mach's "The Lost Boy," Brian Kettler's "In School Suspension," Nick Zagone's "The Missing Pieces" and Andrea Stolowitz's "Bad Family." All of them were engaging and entertaining, but it was Zagone's audacious comedy that showed its Oregon roots in a tale full of Mount St. Helens ash, Rajneeshee mystical twaddle and insider references to the likes of local famed weatherman Jim Bosley.

9. Deadlocked, by Charlaine Harris, $27.95
Tressel probably faces a five-year "show cause" ruling from the NCAA's Committee on Infractions, meaning that prospective college employers must justify hiring him in that period. It is a death sentence as far as being a college coach again goes. The reason the punishment will be severe is Tressel's six years of experience as an athletic director at Youngstown State before he landed the OSU job. He had no excuse for not knowing the rules.

I often lament having left Los Angeles, my hometown, to live in San Francisco, especially now that I have a son. After Kai was born, we found ourselves making the trek up and down Interstate 5 at least once a month. On our third not-so-pleasant jaunt past the sea of cows, Kai began screaming and would not stop. Yearning for somewhere fabulous to stop so we could cuddle him without the stench of manure and diesel, we vowed to start taking the nice way.

WHAT TO PLAY
Howard Troxler: Some of it is just a natural tension. It's funny that Jeb Bush is now so canonized when, as governor, he and the Legislature grated on each other plenty. Bush used the line-item veto to a record extent and sometimes vetoed bills that the Legislature thought he had agreed to sign. Similar friction existed earlier under Lawton Chiles. Of course, now with Crist, there's an overlay of the ideological struggle — the pro-business, education-critic leaders of the Legislature are able to claim that whenever Crist vetoes something, they were the ones being conservative and he was selling out.

Even if you believe Minnesota should not be a graveyard for coaching careers and a punching bag for the rest of the Big Ten, Teague is going to need some help. Or at least some advice.
Since much of May was cool and wet, cicada season got off to a slow start. But now that hot summer-like weather has arrived, the bugs will be humming loudly for the next month.
The festival kicks off with Shakespeare and moves on to culture in just about every form imaginable, including an attempt to create the world's largest Bollywood dance. Artist Richard Wilson will recreate the final scene of the classic British crime film "The Italian Job" by dangling a bus off the De La Warr Pavillion in Bexhill, south of London.
However, most opposition parties have already prepared, or are still preparing, their own proposals on the budget. Ahead of the elections, they will be reluctant to water down their proposals for fear of losing credibility with potential voters.
Autism awareness has come a long way since her son was diagnosed more than 10 years ago.
True to its title, "Little Broken Hearts" amounts to an end-of-the-relationship concept album, told from the point of view of a woman in full control of her poisonous feelings. Unsurprisingly, Jones went through a break-up right before creating the music. To seal the mood, she came up with a sound as broodingly coherent as the soundtrack to a domestic drama.
The 41/2-hour documentary, the first part of which airs on Monday, May 14, on HBO and the second part on Tuesday, May 15, will stream free on HBO.com, and 40,000 copies will be distributed to community service agencies around the country.

The thrum of diesels was soothing, the sun warm on our faces, the surrounding hills green and lovely. As the Alberni Inlet opened into the Imperial Eagle Channel, we detoured to chase humpback whales. Soon we eased up to the dock at Sechart, where canoes, kayaks and gear were offloaded. Then we were off to Ucluelet, brushing the Broken Group Islands.

So far, fewer than half a dozen of them have stepped forward to receive it, an indicator of how bad the problem is. Fulton's 50 percent juror no-show rate, more than five times the national average, has cost taxpayers an estimated $270,000 in the first three months of this year -- the price of casting a wider net to fill jury boxes.
Ohio is among 26 states challenging the law. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, a Republican, said Friday that the states' fight is not over.
"I definitely feel that there is a very strong history of acupuncture, and it does work," said McElroy, who has found that 80 percent of the time the treatment benefits her patients.
Pawlenty's plan would greatly step up state involvement in what has been mostly a federal arena. A key element would be to request authorization for a 10-person team of state agents to enforce federal immigration laws, which the U.S. attorney general has granted to Alabama and Florida.
The real drawback of 1DollarScan, however, is that to save your books in digital form, they have to destroy them by cutting the spine and removing the pages from the binding (sounds gruesome). Another company, Blue Leaf (blueleaf-book-scanning.com), can digitize your books nondestructively, but it's more expensive than 1DollarScan.
The state campaign finance board is investigating the party's finances, with a particular eye on the 2010 recount fund, known as Count Them All Properly, and whether the fund and the party violated campaign finance regulations. Count Them All Properly was set up as an independent corporation in late 2010 to pay for Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer's recount costs. Emmer lost that election to DFLer Mark Dayton by 9,000 votes.

One class he is especially fond of is called "The Joy of Music," and when he talks about it, his face lights up. In the class, Doyle introduced freshmen to the great works of classical music -- Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Maurice Ravel's jazzy Concerto in G -- but he also made sure they introduced him to their music, too. Each student had to make a 17-minute CD of any music they thought Doyle should know, with footnotes and a bibliography. He got CDs of rap and pop music, and some classical music. One student prefaced his music with the remark, "Now, Professor Doyle, perhaps you'd like to sit back with a glass of wine and enjoy this."
Financial stocks led the market lower. Investors worried that a $170 billion bailout for Greece, announced Tuesday, would not be enough to keep the debt-laden country from eventually defaulting and possibly leaving the euro currency group.
Surfing is a wonderful thing but the Duke wasn't kidding when he referred to it as the Sport of Kings. There is nobility about it and anyone who has done it long enough and become accomplished, understands this even if they don't think about it. The nobleness entails a certain amount of respect for the sport and for the other surfers. That respect shouldn't be reserved for the most skillful but absolutely needs to include the less adept, even when they get in the way.

The contrast between the measured properties of the regular season and the extreme attributes of playoff hockey are considerable, especially for last-line defenders. Each moment is magnified, each mistake onerous. All checks are written and finished, often with gratuities added, compliments of the house. It's the spirit of giving in its more lurid form.

I met the boy who became my son when he was 6. I married his father two years later and raised Andy as my own. He was a bright, gentle little guy whose greatest act of childhood rage was to bury his friend's gloves in the yard. It was easy to love someone so smart and sweet, easier still because he needed me.
The Rockies are going to hit. They were awful last year with runners in scoring position, unable to take advantage of their home park against pedestrian pitching. Marco Scutaro and Michael Cuddyer are better than players they replaced. The catching combination of Ramon Hernandez and Wilin Rosario could produce 25 home runs. The lineup is deeper.
Highest-ranking woman: Barbara Maxwell, dean of Arizona school of health sciences.
The Raiders, in the wake of that business decision, have never been the same. Neither have Oakland and local Raiders fans. The split left scars that didn't heal during the team's 13 seasons in L.A. and haven't healed in the 17 seasons since their return to Oakland in 1995.

Subercaseaux's blue and green oil paintings, "Reflection: On Crossing XIV" and "Reflection: On Crossing XXV," depict light and water seen in an abstracted way. Both these artists have a gift for bringing an ineffable quality of experience into the foreground and, in this way, talking about the parts of life we often forget to notice and appreciate.
Meanwhile, Kraus says some Republicans he has talked to do not take Joe the Plumber seriously. He says voters tend to chuckle when they find out who he is running against.
But Dimora told O'Malley that he asked eight banks for a loan against his house, but each one turned him down.

Allen was able to retire on 80 percent of his $110,000 salary even though he served only 17 years on the council, fewer than the 20 needed to receive the maximum benefit.

Van Riemsdyk's chances, and his speed, helped turn the tide for the Flyers, who trailed 1-0 entering the second period on Sunday. It took the Flyers a full 10:02 to net their first shot on goal of the game. By then, New Jersey had jumped out to an 11-0 shots lead. The Flyers outshot the Devils, 36-15, to close out the game.
That almost seemed to help spark the Grizzlies. They opened the second quarter hitting six of their first seven shots and took their first lead on a pair of free throws by Mayo at 31-30 early in the quarter. Nick Young tied it at 37 on a 3 with 6:22 left, then Marreese Speights tipped in a bucket with 5:53 left, and the Grizzlies never trailed or were tied again. Memphis led 51-47 at halftime.

The anti-war, libertarian-leaning, unorthodox Republican hasn't won a single state. Super Tuesday could change that. Paul is focusing on the three caucus states — Idaho, North Dakota and Alaska — where a big turnout by his cadre of enthusiastic followers would have the most impact.

Parker might grab a rebound, bring the ball up the court and try to set up his teammates as he runs the offense. The next possession, he might bury one from the outside.

Sounds like a dream, or a scheme, and in truth it's a bit of both as neither life nor the "Marigold Hotel" turn out exactly as one might wish. But when the bags are packed with pride, prejudice, problems and prospects by some of Britain'sbest — including Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson and Maggie Smith — it makes the trip worth taking. Complementing all that aging grace is Dev Patel, the breakout star of"Slumdog Millionaire," as the irrepressible young owner of the Marigold. Aptly named Sonny, he is trying ever so hard to gloss over any rough patches — at the hotel and in his life or his guests'. It all makes for a movie whose infectious charm outweighs some of the predictability that slips in around the edges.
"With our team down one goal, it's got to be better than that," Toews said. "If we stick with what we've been working on lately, we've got to be positive that it's going to go in for us and it's going to make a huge difference. It's all about work ethic. It's all about being on the same page."
"I can see no legitimate basis in this judicial district to focus the resources of the United States government on the medical marijuana dispensaries that are otherwise compliant with Colorado law or local regulation," Garnett wrote in the letter to Colorado U.S. Attorney John Walsh.

There seem to be more ways than ever for the independent artist to bring in cash. The Future of Music Coalition, an artist lobbying group, announced during SXSW the results of two years of research into how musicians make money. Jean Cook, one of the architects of the project, said the research revealed 42 potential music revenue sources. No single artist is, of course, benefiting from all 42. A classical artist, for instance, may have access to only two or three, she said. But a singer-songwriter may be able to pull from as many as 25 revenue streams.
"The message was, 'Our goalie is our best player, let's start playing for our goalie' - and we did," Hitchcock said. "The third period, we played for our goalie.

The much-mocked sign at a health care town hall last summer, “Keep your government hands off my Medicare,” suggested how many Tea Party supporters had come to the movement without thinking through the specifics.

But "I just want to be happy" is a hole cut out of the floor and covered with a rug. Because once you say it, the implication is that you're not. The "I just want to be happy" bear trap is that until you define precisely, just exactly what "happy" is, you will never feel it. Whatever being happy means to you, it needs to be specific and also possible. When you have a blueprint for what happiness is, lay it over your life and see what you need to change so the images are more aligned.

Yet American allies have developed oil contingency legislation and other administrative plans that will permit their nations to survive a stoppage. These measures include severe vehicle traffic reductions, enabling fast alternative fuel production and mass vehicle fuel retrofitting, as well as rush public transit enhancement and mandated changes in driving habits. Unquestionably, for America to survive such a catastrophe would require a very painful, multi-layered program of immediate-term, short-term, mid-term and long-term fixes that would change our society and transform it off of dependency on oil. Currently, the nation has no real alternative fuel delivery or retrofitting infrastructure. Lawmakers, mayors, governors and candidates have not developed such a plan during the half decade the interruption has been looming.

In 2000, 26 percent of same-sex couples reported having children. Only 21 percent checked yes in the 2010 census.

Smith: Yeah, I would say, probably. I'm trying to be pretty disciplined in every case about committing either budgetary items or a particular divvy of city responsibilities. I do think there is a strong argument for the arts portfolio being in the mayor's office, like the film portfolio, so that it's a demonstration of the city's commitment. But until we have a better sense of the overall picture of what the city bureau distributions will look like, I want to be humble about making early commitments eight months before the election.

If you don't have a full day, you should probably go straight to the Imperial Treasury, whose highlights include the Topkapi Dagger and the Spoonmaker Diamond. The dagger, a gift from Shah Nadir of Iran to Sultan Mahmud I, contains four large cabochon emeralds surrounded by diamonds and gold. The 86-carat (yes ladies, you heard correctly), pear-shaped Spoonmaker Diamond, surrounded by a double row of 49 cut diamonds, was supposedly found by a peasant in a rubbish heap in 1669. In what has to go down as the worst trade in history, the peasant swapped it to a spoonmaker for three wooden spoons. The spoonmaker didn't fare much better: He sold it to a jeweler for 10 silver coins, but at least he lives on in the fabulous bauble's name.

The state is in the process of phasing out the old method of deciding whether a property is eligible for the cap on property-tax increases.

Indiana coach Tom Crean said he’s glad his team flew out Monday night to get acclimated for Indiana’s first NCAA appearance since 2008. Crean said he likes the rainy Portland weather because it keeps the players indoors for the most part and keeps their minds on the basketball business at hand.
"I didn't think he was going to make it," Gibson said.
Or the Celtics can continue to fail to take advantage of the opportunities being placed before them by the depleted Hawks. They can extend this series beyond its natural life, and they can even get themselves stunned if they don’t take care of business tonight, allowing Atlanta to retake the homecourt advantage.
Comfortably settled in ClubAcela, the first-class lounge at New York's Penn Station, I considered the folder of Amtrak sleeping car tickets much as I would money in the bank: a promise of good times ahead. I would travel on the Lake Shore Limited to Chicago, the Empire Builder to Seattle and, finally, the Coast Starlight to Los Angeles. These trains, two of Amtrak's best and one of its most improved, would show me a huge slice of America for the next week.

First, I love to write, a fact known to my senior staff over many years in public office. Periodic opinion pieces in major periodicals and newspapers have not satisfied my appetite, however. The writing, editing and promotion of my first book, "Turn This Car Around," have strengthened my enthusiasm in this regard. And now, another writing opportunity presents itself during the run-up to a hugely significant presidential election.

Romney needs those voters to be as energized as possible to ensure they don't stay home in November. His choice of a vice presidential running mate, his campaign message and his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, assuming he is the nominee, would be critical in winning them to his side.

Round 5 (pick No. 164): Cam Johnson, OLB/DE, Virginia. Another player the Ravens have gotten face time with during the draft process, Johnson could slip because injuries limited his production at the college level. He is strong enough to set the edge against the run and he totaled 10.5 sacks the past two seasons. There are questions about how he would fit in their scheme -- is he mobile enough to play linebacker? -- but he can play.
DaVita's national medical chief, Dr. Allen Nissenson, reviewed the clinic's records and said the multi-year rate includes a spike of 14 patient deaths in 2008.

-- Vintage Atlanta Hawks in the win-or-else Game 6 at Boston: A heavily guarded Josh Smith shot and missed a preposterous 22-foot jumper with six seconds left on the shot clock (it barely hit the front rim) in the final minute. On key possessions, nobody even pretended to get an offensive rebound. Al Horford, needing to intentionally miss the second of two free throws to keep the Hawks' chances alive, put the ball in (moments later, the Hawks were left with 1.3 seconds and no timeouts). And owner Michael Gearon Jr. hauled out the old "dirty player" accusation on Kevin Garnett, who responded with 28 points, 14 rebounds, five blocks and a crucial jump shot over Smith with 30 seconds left. Amazing how often this team stays in character.
SeaWorld began testing a paper-only bag policy last year at SeaWorld San Diego, where the plastic ban was also timed to coincide with the opening of a new sea-turtle attraction there.

The grill. This is where your $5,000 stainless-steel Viking Gas Deluxe Outdoor Warrior really comes in handy - as something on which to set your Bud longneck. The best grilling apparatus is an oak-pit style 'cue, basically a metal fire box at least a couple feet deep topped by a grill that raises and lowers on a cable-type pulley system, allowing you to regulate the heat. Hard but not impossible to find in OC. (Someone call me with a vendor.)

Women who report sexual violence on college campuses seldom see their accused attackers arrested and almost never see them convicted, according to a Tribune survey of several Midwestern universities.
USC's own arrogance brought it down. Thumb through its formal response to the NCAA's Notice of Allegations last year and you'll find little accountability and even less contrition. The university basically dared the NCAA investigators to come after one of college football's marquee brands.
On the adult photo walk, Loberg took us to scenic locations within easy walking distance of the gallery in Yosemite Village.

Power of attorney: Stationery stores sell power of attorney forms. Flores said she alters these forms to specifically grant the power to change retirement plan beneficiaries, set up trusts and deal with tax collectors.

Many Westerners had assumed that encounters with European explorers and traders over the years had introduced a blond gene into the Melanesian gene pool. Among the residents of the Solomon Islands, conventional wisdom holds that sun exposure or heavy fish consumption could be responsible, said co-senior author Sean Myles, a former Stanford postdoc who is now a professor at Nova Scotia Agricultural College, in a statement.
“Bat path” is a mechanical term you hear a lot around the batting cage. It’s not that complicated. For a left-handed hitter to pull the ball, the barrel of the bat has to be facing right field on contact. To hit the ball up the middle, the barrel must be square through the box. And to hit the ball to left field, the barrel has to be lined up in that direction. Basically, what Teixeira is saying is he needs to stop trying to pull the outside pitch.
That's the cause of the collapse of our relations. Not drift, but aggression. Or, as the reset man referred to it with such delicacy in his Kremlin news conference: "our disagreements on Georgia's borders."

No doubt, say those who study the complex issue of military recruitment, the reasons that young men and women decide to don uniforms are myriad. A way to pay for college, to learn a trade. A route to discipline, or to follow the route paved by a father or sister. To avenge 9/11, to test one’s mettle, to serve something bigger than one’s self.
Flights: After peaking in late June and early July, fares are falling. But few experts see a return to last winter's pricing, when sharp-eyed shoppers could find LAX-Honolulu round trips for less than $300.

In Favre's eyes, even if he never plays another down and even though the Vikings lost to the Saints, he will have done just that.
The NFL is punishing violations of a NCAA system that greatly benefits The Shield. But the more college football resembles a billion-dollar professional enterprise -- and it does -- the greater its value to the NFL as a feeder system. Now they're going to punish anybody who runs afoul of college rules that are as outdated as they are unenforceable. When Goodell isn't watching Chuck Norris clean up Texas, my guess is he's watching "Knute Rockne All-American."
SEATTLE -- Dell Inc., already the largest seller of PCs to schools worldwide, is trying to extend its lead with its first mini-laptop designed for young students at a time adult consumers and businesses are cutting back on technology spending.

The crux of the problem, as I learned in my years at the helm, is our wrongheaded approach to risk. In attempting to eliminate all risk from flying, we have made air travel an unending nightmare for U.S. passengers and visitors from overseas, while at the same time creating a security system that is brittle where it needs to be supple.
TL: The honest answer is that we don't know. If there is a compelling story that we think that our audience wants us to talk about, we'll do that. There will be plenty of time for looking back as we go, but it's not the kind of thing I'll be making a speech about. There will be some production surprises from our new imaging voice, Howard Hoffman. And there'll be plenty of time for people to ask whatever they like.
I simmered the soup celery to make Wiley's recipe for - you guessed it - soup celery soup, then peeled and trimmed carrots, green garlic and radishes for giardiniere, an Italian-style vegetable relish.

Of course, costs aren't the only consideration, and many families who choose to pay for advice may get their money's worth. An adviser can help select investments that match the family's appetite for risk, and help maintain an appropriate mix of stock and bond funds as college enrollment approaches. Then there are the complex rules to navigate about tax treatment and withdrawals. Investors also need to balance college-savings needs with other objectives, like saving for retirement or a home purchase.
The ruling handed down in a Pretoria court Tuesday by Judge Hans Fabricius was the first under South African statutes spelling out its international law obligations. Human rights lawyer Nicole Fritz, whose South African Litigation Centre joined the Zimbabwean Exiles forum to bring the suit, said human rights groups have documented cases of torture and other crimes in Zimbabwe. Under Tuesday's order, she said, investigators from a country with a strong legal framework now will be able to hold Zimbabwean officials responsible for crimes allegedly committed during that country's political meltdown.

The NTHMP supplements the tsunami warning system in other ways as well. In California, the state tsunami program, managed and administered by the California Emergency Management Agency with scientific and technical support from the California Geological Survey, completed tsunami inundation mapping for all 20 coastal counties in December 2009. Since then it has assisted authorities in using the maps to develop evacuation plans and response protocols. It has also purchased more than 3,000 tsunami hazard signs for dozens of coastal communities. Other projects include developing a maritime safety zone for evacuations after tsunami warnings.
New Jersey is a national leader, too. In 2007, the state was second only to Kentucky for horse sales as a percentage of agricultural sales, said Paul Gottlieb, associate professor at Rutgers University. And it ranked second, after Rhode Island, for total breeding per acre of land, he said.

Earlier this year, a 24-year-old Iraq war veteran shot and killed a park ranger at Mt. Rainier National Park. In December, a Lewis-McChord soldier was charged with premeditated murder in the late-night stabbing of a 19-year-old woman in a Seattle suburb. The wife of a Lewis-McChord sergeant testified earlier this month that her husband doused her legs in lighter fluid and lit her on fire. Other cases have involved a father accused of waterboarding his child, and a soldier who killed his wife and hid her body in the garage.

I can't recall the page number, but I'm sure the guide to quality filmmaking has strict rules against opening movies with a pre-pre-preamble. It's a clear sign that the director is unsure of his story. Once Carter is magically transplanted to Mars, we finally get to have some fun as he hangs with the Heliumites while they fight the Zodangans. He is smitten with Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins), a beautiful princess-scientist-swordswoman, and runs afoul of Matai Shang (Mark Strong), leader of the mind-manipulating, body-shifting Therns. The Heliumites and Zodangans are called "red men" and "red women," though their redness looks more like the singed aftereffects of a cheap tanning lamp.

Open auditions: Pencil in Poyer, Anthony Watkins, and Reynolds as starters.

The South administration agreed earlier to use some of the School Choice money it’s getting from the state to cover this and other capital projects. It set aside $30,000 for asbestos removal. The school also allocated $40,000 for locker replacements, $20,000 to improve lighting in the high school gym, $30,000 to repair the parking lot, $10,000 for upgrading interior doors and $20,000 toward “pointing” (replacing the grout) on the exterior brick.
