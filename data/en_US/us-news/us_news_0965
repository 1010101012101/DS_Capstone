Collinsworth, who called another good game, broke down Romo’s illegal forward pass well when he noted how Romo must’ve lost track of where he was on the field after escaping to his left, avoiding a couple of defenders and scrambling back to his right.

Top Democrats did not sign on to his 33-bill package, anchored by a constitutional amendment that would limit annual property tax hikes to 2.5 percent, except when local voters decide to override it.

Introduced by the Brazilian composer on his own first album (the 1970 "Agora"), "O Amor" was originally a fast and aggressive samba. Mr. Maret has made it into something more romantic, as he performs it with Mr. Thielemans. To underscore the deep majesty of the two harmonicas, they're backed by a full string orchestra. The juxtaposition of mouth organs and strings paints an overwhelming picture of rays of sunlight cutting through the clouds.
Both men are being held in the Wayne County Jail on $500,000 cash bond. If convicted of the charges, they could face life in prison.

9. A.J. Jenkins, Illinois, 6-0, 190. He has come on strong in the postseason, starting with his performance in the East-West Shrine Game. Jenkins is a smooth, fast route runner who can separate. His hands are pretty good. He can make catches in tight coverage. He needs to improve his strength and play more physically. He also needs to play more consistently, as he has had some route busts. Jenkins can play in the slot or outside. His potential is very good.

Hey, high schoolers!
If Sella and Uychich are bummed about that, they sure don't show it. They look absolutely thrilled to be showcasing at SXSW, and they launch themselves into their set like boxers who can't wait to get to the center of the ring and start throwing haymakers. Uychich is particularly ferocious tonight, swinging out at his cymbals with the spastic urgency of a kid trying to knock open a pinata. It doesn't even matter that he's playing to pre-recorded synthesizers and sound effects -- he's got the energy of a man unchained. At the beginning of the Front Bottoms set, Lambert's is half full (the venues on Sixth and Seventh all seem to be at capacity and then some), but by the time the band hits its stride, the room fills up with enthusiastic listeners. One of them is Devine himself, who joins Sella onstage for the chorus of "The Beers." The crowd loves the co-sign: If Kevin Devine is excited by the Front Bottoms, they're bound to be worth paying attention to.
The employees were able to call police. No suspects were in custody.

The Pomeranz project also includes improving his policing of baserunners. The Diamondbacks robbed Pomeranz blind in the third. Gerardo Parra stole second and third and scored on Young's single, putting Arizona ahead 3-0.
Kasich has said he wants to phase out Ohio's income tax, which currently represents 40 percent of the state's annual revenue. But he has yet to say how he would replace that sizeable chunk of money that the state is reliant upon.
But Manning missed his 14th season, in 2011, because of complications from four neck surgeries. The uncertainty of his health, a $28 million roster bonus that was due March 9, and the opportunity to select college phenom quarterback Andrew Luck with the No. 1 draft pick led Colts owner Jim Irsay to release Manning on March 7.

Eamonn Brennan, ESPN.com: "Combined, Duke and Missouri wield well over 100 million in their combined athletic budgets; their overall university endowments dwarf that of Lehigh and Norfolk State and any other No. 15 seed you'll ever see. The Blue Devils and Tigers are members of the entrenched college sports aristocracy, the dominion of top-100 recruiting and charter jets and shoe-company contracts and greed-laden conference realignment and billion-dollar television deals. Lehigh and Norfolk State don't exist in this universe. These schools' recruits aren't elite AAU prospects. Oftentimes, they aren't really prospects at all."
ø"It's kind of scary," said Cameron Bawden, 22, who is graduating from the University of Nevada-Las Vegas in December with a business degree.

Others have lost a lot of weight because they are walking more and eating healthier."

OP&F Director Bill Estabrook said change is certain. Down the road, retirees may be given a monthly stipend to cover their health care, or perhaps survivors and dependent children won’t be covered as they are now, he said. “They’re just going to have to bear more of the cost.”

Seeking information about the missing Dimitri, Nick and Hank go to the boxing gym, which looks like it's down in the inner Southeast industrial area. Local actor alert! Todd Tolces plays the uncle, who says Dimitri has gotten into trouble with drugs but is a good kid. Nick spots Bryan, another boxer, as a creature (a "Grimm Rhino creature, a Dickfellig," according to the show's Website. Dickfellig? Really?) Bryan sees that Nick is a Grimm. Bryan tells Nick and Hank that he last saw Dimitri when his fellow boxer was heading to Forest Park for a run.

Well, not quite. After all, kids who eat whole foods over processed are less likely to suffer from depression, obesity and diabetes, among other serious health conditions. Plus, even if you embrace just a few "Cleaner Plate" strategies you might notice some amazing changes in your house: Food may stop being a constant source of conflict. You may sit down together as a family a little more often. You and your kids may get more joy out of cooking and eating. And as the book says, "That's so much more satisfying than peeling back the plastic film on a microwavable dinner."
Wouldn't this be a nice way to prove Bryant simply needed an innovative procedure on his surgically repaired right knee and sprained left ankle to retain his dominance? Perhaps. But then Bryant wouldn't have sat out for seven consecutive games to recover from a sore left shin. He wouldn't have accommodated Andrew Bynum's want for more touches in the post. And he certainly would have scored more than 18 points on seven-of-12 shooting in the Lakers' double-digit loss Friday to San Antonio.

The export vision is larger, more expensive, and could face new environmental hurdles on water and air quality.
Defense attorney John Runfola said McKibbin and his family have suffered greatly because of the case and are glad it's over.
There is a school of thought around baseball that there is no such thing as a bad one-year contract. Sure the one-year deal the Cardinals signed Brad Penny to in 2009 didn't work out in 2010, but it was over with and done and gone and both parties moved on. Long-term commitments, especially to pitchers (see: Zito, Barry), have a way of dragging a team down, capsizing a payroll and complicating future deals. They are not only difficult to shed, but should the pitcher falter or fall apart, they are difficult to work around, too.
"The number one concern I hear is, 'Find me a job and find me a job I can support my family on,'" Adams said.
I read President Obama's State of the Union address last week. It started out in the usual way, but on Page 2 I perked up. This was right after the part where he talked about Master Lock and bringing jobs back to the United States.
All but three of the deaths over the past decade occurred in family child-care settings, which include about two-thirds of the Minnesota children in licensed day care. Family providers are licensed by the state but, unlike larger center-based facilities, they operate out of private homes and usually have a single caregiver with little outside supervision.
There even was a vote: An overwhelming majority voiced their support for Christensen to stick around "four more years" -- but he's retiring anyway after a 42-year career at the university. Along the way, he's shepherded through at least two generations of political leadership in San Jose, many of whom were among the 500 or so people paying tribute to Christensen.
Most, though, were either at the high end of the range with a home that hadn't been updated for many years (see that "depending on condition" condition, guys), or they were actually over $600,000.

He compares it to the collapse of Lehman Brothers: Analysts saw it coming, but the fallout in still caught them by surprise. A money market mutual fund found that it couldn't redeem its customers' money. Money market funds, which many considered as safe as savings accounts, suddenly looked suspect until the Federal Reserve backed them up.
In particular, Christie said Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) personally asked him for Republican support to stay in power if dissident Democrats tried to oust her to stop the cuts. Then Christie delivered, asking surprised members of his own party to cross the aisle and back Oliver if there was a coup attempt.

The Art of Animation Resort will be built on a 65-acre plot across a lake from Disney's Pop Century Resort. The location will allow Disney to use a pair of long-neglected, unfinished buildings that Disney originally constructed as a second phase of Pop Century but which it abandoned amid the 2001 recession. Pop Century's first phase was completed in 2003.
DCM has been sued three times in federal court. Each case was settled quickly and the lawsuits were dismissed. "That is an astoundingly good performance record for any collections firm, let alone one working in as sensitive an area" as deceased debt collection, said Newburger, the University of Texas consumer law expert. "It proves that it's possible to run a compassionate collection agency."
Some of the opposition to sulfites seems to be based on misinformation. One of the Organic Consumers Assn.'s major arguments against adding sulfites is that they are allergens. Technically, that is true, but research has shown that most people who think they are allergic to sulfites are actually reacting to something else.

At Crystal Bridges, after chatting with the aforementioned greeters, we toured the museum's special exhibit (now closed) of contemporary art and permanent collection of colonial art, landscape painting, American impressionism, modern and contemporary art. The galleries are connected by glass vestibules that offer views of the museum's spring-fed ponds and an opportunity to consider what they just experienced before moving on to the next period. The museum's many reading lounges, appointed with comfortable, modern furniture and stacks of art books, also give visitors a chance to relax and reflect.

øIn a change from recent years, some goalies are worthy of first-round selections, notably Andrei Vasilevski and Oscar Dansk. And there's pretty fair depth behind them with kids like Andrey Makarov, Brandon Whitney and Malcolm Subban.
And finally, I still don’t know why the Giants put the ball in the air the way they did on third-and-goal with 1:40 to play. It’s a disaster waiting to happen. Can you imagine what today is like if CB Leodis McKelvin picks that off and the Bills win the game? Seriously, do you realize the difference between what happened and what could have happened? There was clearly confusion on that play because WR Victor Cruz was right next to Manningham, so there was a cluster of players around the ball. I’m actually surprised Manning didn’t just hold it or throw it away. Crisis averted. Barely.
"I find that the remaining 13 gametes should be divided between the parties. Assuming it is not possible, or that it is impractical, to divide one sperm straw in half, I award seven sperm straws to the claimant, J.C.M., and six sperm straws to the respondent, A.N.A.," Russell wrote.

The new joint venture, on the city's west side near I-96 and the Southfield Freeway, is an encouraging development in that vein. There's also optimism building in economic development circles that a so-called supplier park of several auto parts firms, an idea Mayor Dave Bing has advocated, may come together in the next few months.
Its a tossup between Darlington Nagbe and Kenny Cooper. Cooper is a going to be for the Timbers what Clyde Drexler was for the Blazers, a hero and superstar. Nagbe is going to really going to made people take notice this season and we might just end up with two all-stars on our roster.

One of the more affordable yet absurdly generous (verging on obscene) dishes I've ordered in a long while: The traditional Greek platter ($14) brought enough nutmeg-spiked moussaka, bechamel-lush pastitsio, a phalanx of tangy dolmas (drizzled with a lemony cream sauce) and pile of shaved gyros to easily serve several people. All elements were hearty, tasty crowd-pleasers. Oh, and I forgot to mention the heap of herbed french fries. Whew.

Eli Thomssen applied early to the state's economic development agency to have his biotech firm, also based in Ann Arbor, on a list of that state's eligible small-business investments. But before his firm, Armune BioScience Inc., could begin looking for investors, state lawmakers killed the 25% tax credit. The firm, which is developing a diagnostic test for prostate and other cancers, needs about $400,000 to keep its lab running until the tests are ready to bring to market, Mr. Thomssen says.
As many as 50 Patton supporters have attended board meetings, but on Monday only one – Ross Velderrain – attended and addressed the board.

Part of why I love being a nurse is because this profession forces me to keep working on myself, to keep becoming the best and most fulfilled and giving version of myself. To develop my emotional intelligence.
Finding the right balance is terribly difficult, but what's needed is less mass screening of all those proverbial grandmothers. Racial and ethnic profiling is not only provocative, it is also ineffective, because it produces far too many "false positives" -- people subjected to secondary screening without cause. Rather, what we need is more screening and profiling based on intelligence to provide grounds for suspicion (which should have included the would-be Detroit bomber) or on suspicious behavior (like having no luggage or paying cash for the ticket).

We hope this is the case, but we’re not sure. Gov. Christie has yet to sign the bill. If he does, it will be a watershed event. But will he? Sen. Joseph M.

Other trends are magnifying the risk of the just-in-time approach. Parts supply companies downsized significantly during the recession, and the remaining firms don't have the money or staff to stock up on raw materials in case of a disruption. The industry also shrank because carmakers needed increasingly specialized parts to meet government safety and fuel economy standards. Suppliers without those products went out of business.

Easter, which was April 8 this year after falling on April 24 in 2011, and high-school spring breaks that tend to occur around the same time pulled some shopping into March, Adrienne Tennant, a Washington-based analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, said in a report before results were announced. Cooler temperatures in the Northeast in late April also were a negative for sales of spring merchandise, she said.
"Kinect Star Wars" (LucasArts, for the Xbox 360, $49.99) is a light saber fan's dream title. Using Microsoft's Kinect camera, which translates your motions into on-screen activity, you start with training against floating droids shooting red rays.

In a head-to-head comparison, the only clear winner is the turkey. The regular thaw-it-three-days-ahead turkey was vastly superior to the miniroast in nutrition, cost and taste. And the roast wasn't even that convenient. The label said you could put the roast in the oven directly from the freezer. But it took 10 minutes to wrest the gravy packet from the frozen roast. Imagine trying to get a grape out of a frozen bowling ball. The roasting took 30 minutes longer than the label indicated. Then, you had to cut off the netting used to mash the white and dark meat together. Imagine trying to peel pantyhose off a molten bowling ball. And the roast tasted salty and tough.

McCluer vs. Webster Groves, 3:45 p.m.
Jonathan Sanchez and Luis Mendoza have been nearly as bad. This is somewhat expected from Mendoza, but Sanchez was the team's centerpiece offseason acquisition.

In the meantime, all three agreed, smart machines pose moral quandaries that earlier gadgets didn't. It's not that machines have rights that must be respected. It's that there's something corrosive about abusing a device that mimics a living creature. As Wilson put it, society might consider it OK to smash a toaster but not an interactive toy with a synthetic personality, even if it doesn't really have feelings. To do otherwise risks raising a generation of people inured to cruelty.

On a cold, mostly gray afternoon with only 9,072 fans in Progressive Field, the Masterson who faced the media after such an ineffective, almost obscure outing, was no different than the pitcher who was cheated by the bullpen before a record Opening Day crowd last week.

The singers have names: Sophie (portrayed by Wendolyn Cooper) is the first soprano, a student with a pleasant but unremarkable voice; Sharon (Laura Pyper) is the second soprano, who flees in terror upon her first encounter with Callas but returns later to confront her; and Tony (Ian Cullity) is the tenor, the only singer with the confidence to match Callas'  and a swagger that nearly makes her swoon. His singing of "Recondita Armonia," the painter's aria from "Tosca," nearly brings her to tears. Manny, the accompanist who provides piano support to these performers, is well-played by Michael Wiles. Andrew J.

Fortunately, others are wading through the verbiage and delivering the key info. As Entertainment Weekly puts it: "After months of media speculation, Glenn Beck and Fox News have agreed to break up. They’ll still see each other, of course, since they’ll be cooperating on a 'variety of television projects … as well as content for other platforms.'" In other words, Beck will be leaving his daily program on Fox later this year.

Culprits: Almost every single politician deserves a share of the blame. The political class likes easy money. In the early stages, inflation feels good.

The veterinarian where "pets are people too." Who knew you could get secure paper shredding seven days a week?

ø"Take away the political divide between parties over the environment and all the debate about the science disappears," Brulle says. Every time you read a story claiming global warming science isn't real, he concludes, you are watching a sideshow, a magician's act designed to distract you while our political and industrial leaders put off any decisions about climate. Consider the case of how one scientist literally vanished from a book by one politician.

I love the way Evans and his sound designer use sound, especially quiet.

The spiciest flavor came in the house salsa, a tasty, smooth but peppery sauce served with freshly fried chips. One quibble: The chips and salsa sit waiting on each empty table for diners to arrive.

I remember V-E Day well. I was just a boy back in Rutherglen, Scotland. The blackouts had been lifted, the curtains had been removed from windows and the street lights had been turned on for the first time since the bombing started in 1940. It was great fun; we could play hide and seek and hide in the shadows. As kids, we were amazed to see shadows because we had never seen the lights before at night time. As the war was nearing the end, people all over were excited and we were preparing by gathering everything we could beg, borrow or steal so we could build a bonfire in our neighborhood. However, two days before V-E Day someone set OUR pile of wood on fire! We were incensed at the scoundrel who had done that, but with true Scottish determination, we decided we'd build another one. Frantically, we raided every other bonfire we could, and within two days we had rebuilt our own. On May 8, 1945, when the announcement came that the war was finally over, we, as well as everyone else throughout the whole country, lit our bonfires – right in the middle of the street! Because May 8th was my 10th birthday, I thought "What a nice birthday gift that all these bonfires are lit for me!" People were dancing in Main Street, Rutherglen, until the wee hours of the morning while we kids were up watching. They were dancing and marching up and down Main Street, singing songs and celebrating. Whenever I think of birthdays, I always remember, with the boyish heart of a 10 year old, V-E Day as my most memorable one.

Directed by Margolius, the six-member ensemble brings stirring vocal nuance to the songs (aided by Gary Powell's deft musical direction), and a generally understated — sometimes too understated — reportorial delivery to the letters. The structure is a bit shaggy, given the aforementioned lack of clear historical parallels between the wars. But just as many in the South viewed the Union forces as unwelcome occupiers, so too, as the letters attest, do many Afghanis. "Sometimes I feel like I'm invading their privacy," says one soldier.

Pacific's move was the best and worst kept secret in Big West circles. The timing of Wednesday's announcement came as a surprise, but rumors had been swirling for years, even decades, that the Tigers considered themselves a better fit in a league of small, faith-based institutions than as the only private school in a forest of giant, public campuses from the CSU and UC systems.

The divergent interpretations by justice officials in the Martin case raise the haunting specter of justice denied in other "stand your ground" cases.

You could also try holding the food dish in your hand to see if that helps. Basically, you want to try to avoid Fritzy practicing the OCD behavior.
