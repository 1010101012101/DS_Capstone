It was that way with me the first time I sipped a bright green drink call "avocado pearl." It was a cold, thick, refreshing beverage  complete with an entertainment component.

Everybody here, we’re here because somebody, somewhere, felt a sense of larger responsibility -- not just to themselves; to their family, first of all, but then also to their community, also to their country. Maybe they served like Dave. Maybe they worked in a local charity.

And now it’s our turn to be responsible. Now it’s our turn to make sure the next generation has the same opportunities that we do.

" "Arik," of course, is Israel's stroke-stricken ex-premier, Ariel Sharon - the once-decisive military genius. His successor, Olmert, is accused by many Israelis of having hesitated and mismanaged the recent war in Lebanon. There's no doubt the Israel Defense Forces dealt a heavy blow to Iran's Lebanese-based stooge army, Hezbollah. Israelis are right when they say air and sea bombardments weren't enough to rout the terrorists, and Olmert's hesitation before sending in massive Israeli ground forces could have proved disastrous. Angered and confused, a growing number of Israelis now demand an official state investigation into the way the war was waged. Some Israelis charge Israel's legendary army - especially its reserve forces, which provided a full 50% of the troops who fought in Lebanon and suffered a high percentage of the casualties - was often badly led and poorly supplied. "It was a catastrophe," says reserve officer Jack Silverman, part of a small group of reservists who have set up a protest camp outside the Knesset, Israel's parliament, demanding the resignation of Olmert & Co. Other reservists say they were sent into battle missing pieces of equipment and with so little food and water that "we had to break into grocery stores.

Grilled steak and corn make a classic combo, but I wanted a change from Southwestern-style steak salad with black beans and avocado. My Food & Wine colleagues and I were pining for elote, Mexican-style grilled corn on the cob, so we dreamed up a dressing with the components of this Mexican street-cart treat. The grilled corn is usually coated with lime, mayonnaise, chile powder and salty cotija cheese. These went to the salad dressing, thinned with buttermilk. Instead of serving the grilled corn on the cob, we put the kernels in the salad with spicy radishes and thin slices of chile-coated steak.
Buzz: The first "Hangover" was sharply made, hilarious and, refreshingly, not your typical bawdy comedy.

Under the influence now of eight glasses of wine, I was in no condition for another vineyard slog, especially on foot, but off we hiked to the ridge to check out the view and, Judy said, the "Zen Bell."

She intended to soothe us with the sound, but instead it triggered a rumble in my gut. I looked at Rod.

As true as that was in the past, this dichotomy seems to have been especially true last year when the teenage movies weren't very good and didn't exactly set the box office on fire either. One could say that they even reached a tipping point in 2011 — a point where the bombast turned to noise, the special effects to exhaustion, the plots to unimaginative confusion. So the Oscar nominees may not be just a demonstration of a sudden burst of nostalgia. They may be a demonstration of the self-contempt of an industry that is finally tired of itself and of the movies that have defined it for two decades. This doesn't mean that they will retreat from teenage blockbusters. It just means that they are using the Oscars to stage a small protest against the sorts of movies they feel we the audience sadistically forces them to make.

But according Congressional Budget Office projections, the Senate version of the CLASS measure would require annual premiums of $1,477, regardless of age, or $1,752 if the slightly different House version were to become law. The House bill's premiums would be higher because it would also allow non-working spouses to enroll, and they are more likely to qualify in the future for benefits, according to CBO chief Douglas Elmendorf.

Your editorial, "Baltimore's Tax Diet," (May 7) is, in your own words, an exercise in "wishful thinking." The notion that Baltimore's ills will be cured "tiny tax break by tiny tax break" is almost not worthy of adult conversation. The plan only works "…if the city sticks to the plan" and the "sticking" must continue for decades.

“I want to try and get a little more speed out on the floor,’’ McMillan said. “I thought about doing it last night (in Indiana) for the second half, but didn’t. I just feel like we need to try and get more speed in the game so we can be aggressive at both ends of the floor.’’

Let's be clear about this: No one knows what the post-"Hunger Games" hit franchise will be, and anyone who tells you they do is lying. Or, at the very least, putting hope before good sense. The reason is simple -- you can't, with any kind of reasonable accuracy, predict a hit.

"If you're a good team that's playing bad -- and I'm not talking about Seattle, so don't implicate me; I'm talking about anybody -- in general up in the major leagues if you're a good team that's playing bad and you're playing a team that's not as good and is playing good, you get beat," Leyland said.

A. Winter damage is likely to occur if you prune the crape myrtles at this time. The trees and shrubs need a rest period often referred to as dormancy. This is the way they prepare for spring growth and resist cold damage. If crape myrtles are pruned during fall, they are likely to sprout new shoots and continue growth into the winter. This makes them more susceptible to freezing temperatures. Similar damage may occur if the trees are growing under nighttime lights that keep them in a growth phase. Wait until January or February to do major pruning. Of course, a shoot that is in your way can be removed anytime.

Apple's 100-acre, 500,000-square-foot data center in Maiden, N.C., is the region's largest, and Apple and Greenpeace have been publicly arguing about how much electricity the new facility, which is near completion, will require and what percentage of the electricity will come from renewable sources.

That's a significant question, because a ticket surcharge will help pay for the arena, but if people don't buy tickets, how do you pay for the arena? And who is on the hook if people don't buy tickets because the Kings are still in last place in 2015, when the new arena is scheduled to open?

It is now abundantly clear that neither is about to share with the voting public his thoughts about Ohio's looming $8 billion budget shortfall. But Strickland and Kasich's distasteful game of political chicken should not extend to their obligation to share with voters how they plan to help create a business climate that stops Ohio's race to the bottom.

All this is preface to noting that President Barack Obama is in South America, where he perhaps has gone to look for his spine. He hasn't yet found it, because he's calling for a debate on the drug war while immediately adding that legalization is "not the answer" to the discussion he says he wants.

Mario Manningham was David Tyree, sparking the drive with an incredible 38-yard, toe-tapping catch up the left sideline on a perfect throw from Manning.

“You know, Jimmy and I weren’t really close until he was hit with cancer. But he said what I say now: There won’t be a cure in my lifetime, but we’re getting closer every day. So people ask me why I’m obsessed and act like I’m 12. I have no choice.

His wife told me that he was a veteran, that he suffered from PTSD and other mental illnesses, and that he had talked with her about taking his life. He chose a tranquil spot in the park, where water laps against the shore and a breeze always seems to blow. In doing so, he may have been seeking some respite from the trauma he had suffered. He left behind a wife and a baby.

So this side effect will likely raise concern among advisory panelists. The staff memo said the FDA and Orexigen are "in the early stages of discussing" how to measure the drug's cardiovascular risk. The panel could recommend that study be completed before the FDA approves marketing of Contrave, or they could recommend it be done after the drug hits the market.

In 1978, Adrienne Rich was not an old woman, but the degenerative arthritis that eventually crippled her had already begun to compromise her free movement — hence the cane. I was a young poet and feminist, an ardent admirer of the writer beside me, whom I had invited (along with a few other distinguished authors) to appear "on site" in prisons throughout New York state, as part of a lecture series/writing program I had organized. Adrienne was one of the few writers who agreed to appear "inside."
But the growing chain embraced the theme of the 1899 children's book “The Story of Little Black Sambo.” It depicts a dark-skinned boy who saves himself from tigers by running them around until they turn to butter, then pours it on some pancakes. It seemed a good fit, since pancakes were a Sambo's signature dish. The chain expanded to around 1,200 restaurants across the United States. But what seemed like a good idea in 1957 was poison for business in much of the country by the mid-1970s. The name was seen as racist in many communities.

We do know something about that. About 125 people a week come to the warehouse, referred by caseworkers from more than 70 social service agencies from around the area: groups that help battered women, immigrants, homeless teens, recovering addicts, families living with HIV and AIDS, low-income seniors, hospitals, schools. They pick up boxes of dishes and silverware and sheets, wander the aisles in search of the perfect sofa, the right-size mattress, a television. Sometimes they tear up. Or remark that this is the first apartment they’ve had in their life. But the volunteers do not get to see what happens after these things leave the warehouse, the new memories and meanings that surround them.
