Exxon Mobil's current buyback program has reduced the company's count of outstanding shares by nearly 19 percent over the past five years, or $129 billion, S&P said.

This project deserved that sort of respect after all of the sacrifice and dedication that went into working on it."
A long recession has reduced the city's tax base. Years of cutbacks of other city agencies made it obvious the Fire Department needed trimming, too. Finally, bolder leaders at City Hall came along.

The studied vagueness of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's government also indicates that it seeks to avoid the mistake of announcing a goal that it might not be able to accomplish, as it did in 2006 when it proclaimed that it would destroy Hezbollah after the Lebanon-based terrorist group launched a cross-border attack and killed three Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two. Although Israel inflicted major losses, it was unable to destroy Hezbollah as an organization, which fed perceptions that the latter had won a political victory.

Mr. Rainford's harsh words read like a punch to the gut. But, intentionally or not, they metaphorically describe the multitude of problems facing St. Louis.

More young people per capita are killed in gun violence in St. Louis than in any city in the nation except New Orleans.

I'm not saying the Karma is a perfect design. The whole thing is pretty overdrawn, for my tastes. The diamond motif is painful. The intersection of the curving shoulder line and the rising front fender line creates a visual slackness at base of the windshield, making the car look like it's sagging a bit. Maybe it is. At 5,300 pounds, the Karma is the heaviest four-seater this side of a Cessna.

I've witnessed many programs there, many afternoons of kids playing games with each other, basketball in the gym or learning at computers. But they have to do homework first, before they can play. They have structure at these clubs, often more structure than they would get at home, and we all know most kids thrive better when their lives are structured. They're in a safe, controlled, supervised environment rather than out roaming the streets, or home alone without someone to look after them.

What's happening, according to BCG, is a "reshoring" back to America of manufacturing that previously migrated offshore, especially to China. The BCG analysts estimate that by 2015, China's cost advantage will have shrunk to the point that many manufacturers will prefer to open new plants in the U.S. In the vast manufacturing region surrounding Shanghai, total compensation packages will be about 25 percent of those for comparable workers in low-cost U.S. manufacturing states. But given higher American productivity, effective labor costs will be about 60 percent of those in America -- not low enough to compensate U.S. manufacturers for the risks and volatility of operating in China.

In disciplining Busch, NASCAR president Mike Helton repeated several times that Busch was parked specifically for the Hornaday incident and it was not a penalty based on overall body of work. Some fans contend Patrick should also have been subjected to a penalty under that premise.

Matheny put his own stamp on this affair. He put the Cards in motion with hit-and-run calls and got a stolen base from Furcal. He opted not to use pinch-hitters in the seventh for Jon Jay and Descalso, valuing defense over an opportunity to avoid a lefty-lefty matchup at the plate. He rode Lohse into the eighth inning, passing on another pinch-hitting opportunity.
Poodles possess a dense coat, which may be curly or corded but hardly ever sheds, thus making them ideal pets for allergy sufferers. They do need to be groomed regularly to keep their coats free from tangles and mats. This breed is especially bright, quick to train and lives well with young children. Their affectionate and loving nature helps them form strong bonds with the family. They make excellent watchdogs.

Players who were considering the draft prior to this year were able to "test the waters" by working out with NBA teams and getting direct feedback from regarding their pro potential. The NCAA's new April 10 deadline for declaring no longer allows for that. It is impossible to predict exactly where Cunningham will be drafted, but many experts expect him to be selected somewhere in the second round.

Efforts to improve maternal health are having unintended consequences. In 2005 India started paying women $30 to have their babies in hospitals instead of at home. Partly as a result, last year hospitals performed 17 million deliveries, up from just 750,000 in 2006. Many hospitals simply can't handle the traffic, government and hospital officials say.

"It allows the county to put down the cash portion of the bond without having to raise taxes, which would be a very significant hit to the taxpayers," Molinelli said. "So I'm very happy to work with the county executive in that regard."
Reflecting upon growing voter indifference in democracies across the Atlantic, historian Tony Judt chalked it up to a roster of world leaders who "convey neither conviction nor authority" and "stand for nothing in particular." These words resonate in the aftermath of Washington's rancorous debt ceiling debate as Democrats wonder how, despite controlling the Senate and Oval Office, they lost out on their one major demand: that spending cuts be paired with at least some increased revenue. It seems their president set the tone by negotiating from a position of weakness from the start, agreeing to unprecedented cuts in entitlement programs his party holds dear, asking for little in return — and constantly giving in on his own demands. The Democrats must again wonder about their president's convictions and mettle: Where does he stand? What principles will he fight for? Is nothing sacrosanct for him?

California Senator Leland Yee (D-San Francisco/San Mateo) has introduced legislation to stop employers from formally requesting or demanding employees or job applicants provide their social media usernames and passwords. The bill comes after a growing number of businesses and public agencies around the country are asking job seekers and workers for their Facebook and Twitter account information and passwords. "It is completely unacceptable for an employer to invade someone's personal social media accounts," said Yee. "Not only is it entirely unnecessary, it is an invasion of privacy and unrelated to one's work performance or abilities." Rather than formally requesting passwords and usernames, some employers have demanded applicants and employees to sit down with managers to review their social media content or fully print out their social media pages. Yee says his bill will also prohibit this practice. IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law professor Lori Andrews, who specializes in Internet privacy, told the Associated Press that these practices, even when given voluntarily, should not be allowed.

But Stern said the NBA viewed the deal as a solid one for all parties, including the team, otherwise it would not have put up its own money. He said the Kings could have said no "in a somewhat more eloquent way" than by hiring a Los Angeles public relations firm "to try to damage the deal from a PR perspective."
A delay is about the big picture - giving aldermen and others time to properly nail down an idea that looks pretty good. For the sake of taxpayers, for the sake of the decaying city infrastructure the Trust promises to rebuild, let's take the time to get this right.
The reforms bring fiscal control and responsibility back to the elected officials responsible for spending taxpayer dollars, which, in turn, gives taxpayers a seat at the negotiation table.

We're unimpressed, to say the least, with Greuel's campaign commercial, in which she takes on a program at the Housing Department and rails against "the city" for its failure to track loans. As for the loans, she has been a member of the council's oversight committee and bears as much responsibility as anyone. As for the department, she would do well to ensure that every city agency is as efficient and effective, and as good at resisting political pressure from council members who would rather the department offer special deals to favored developers than conduct business in an evenhanded, transparent fashion. The department should be her model, not her target.

A: It landed about three feet above the hole and rolled in. The rain wasn't a bother, but it was really windy. The guy who played before me hit what I thought was a pretty good-looking shot. But the wind got it and pushed it about 20 yards to the right of the hole. So, I aimed about 20 yards left and the wind took my ball right back to the green.

Arguably, the party hasn’t stopped for more than a year. Lady Gaga has rewritten the rules of pop star engagement, touring the Monster Ball, in one form or another, almost continuously since November 2009. She seems completely unafraid of overexposure. The Monster Ball has taken her across America and around the world. The Muellers, a family of four from Hamburg, caught the show in Oberhausen, Germany almost a year ago. They’d traveled to New York City to celebrate the Easter weekend with relatives, and their flight arrived early enough to allow them to see Lady Gaga at Prudential Center.

D.A. Points, whose first bogey in 41 holes made the three-man playoff possible, went long and did well to two-putt from par, the second putt from 12 feet. McIlroy, who drilled a 3-wood nearly 340 yards and was last to hit, didn't turn his wedge enough with the wind and was left with a difficult birdie putt from about 25 feet. He ran it 5 feet by the hole and made that for par.

The Blazers also could sign Batum, 23, to a long-term deal. But interim general manager Chad Buchanan said keeping Batum in restricted status would free up more money to spend in free agency. Batum's qualifying offer will place a $5.4 million cap hold onto the Blazers' salary cap, which figures to be $3 million to $5 million less than what the Blazers would sign him to under a long-term deal.

To get back to the idea of understanding life's possibilities through literacy - when you can read, you can read other people's stories.

War: Has not specified the troop numbers behind his pledge to ensure the "force level necessary to secure our gains and complete our mission successfully" in Afghanistan. "This is not time for America to cut and run." Said Obama was wrong to begin reducing troop levels as soon as he did. Would increase strength of armed forces, including number of troops and warships, adding almost $100 billion to the Pentagon budget in 2016. Has spoken in favor of covert action by the U.S. and regional allies in Syria but "the right course is not military" intervention by the U.S. Criticizes Obama's approach on Iran as too conciliatory and associates himself more closely with hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Has not explicitly threatened a U.S. military strike, but in one Republican debate said that re-electing Obama would guarantee an Iranian bomb and that electing him would guarantee Iran would not get a nuclear weapon. "Of course you take military action" if sanctions and internal opposition fail to dissuade Tehran from making a nuclear weapon.

San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, Piazza San Lorenzo, is perhaps the least well-known of Rome's seven great pilgrimage churches. Small, cozy, off the beaten track, on the southeast side of the city beside Campo Verano cemetery, it was built by Emperor Constantine I where San Lorenzo was grilled on a gridiron in AD 258.

We were somewhere around the Shaman Shack on the edge of the dance floor when the self-love began to take hold. The Enabler remembers saying something like, "I feel a bit enlightened; maybe we should dance..." and suddenly there was a hypnotic beat all around and the room was full of what looked like liberated hippies, all swooping and screeching and diving around the dance floor, which was grooving at about a million beats per minute with the lights flashing at Grateful Fridays, a metaphysical club night at Bardot in Hollywood.

With two new quarterbacks sharing the snaps Saturday in senior Joe Bauserman and Braxton Miller, a lot of eyes will be on Brewster, whether there was a preseason election or not.
Tillery was part of an elite scout group before becoming a pilot in 2002, said Roger Trueax, his stepfather. Tillery was good friends with the other pilots who died, each part of the 10th Combat Aviation Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, at Fort Drum, N.Y.
I was dying to do "Les Miz!" I talked to the director, and then four months passed. No one told me anything, so I thought, "I guess I don't have it." Then I got the call and I was over the moon. I can't believe I got this role. It really has come full circle for me. I was 10 or 11 when I saw ‘Les Miz' for the first time in Philly. I was one of those girls singing Cosette when I was 15. Now, I'm playing her at 26. The thrill for me is I get to sing again in a movie. I'm really, truly so grateful. But my poor sister. I'm going to clean up after the cat later and sing the entire soundtrack.
Finally, at about 6:40 p.m., Phoenix police officials met with a group of the organizers and told them that because their request for a permit to hold the music festival had been rejected, they could not be lawfully assembled at the site.

As I sat on a high ledge of the 734-year-old Mingalarzedi Temple, looking out over the hundreds of ancient temples around Bagan, I wondered how long it would take a visitor to see them all. Archaeologists say there once were about 5,000 temples, but earthquakes, decay and long-ago looters have destroyed more than half of them. Still, that's a lot of temples to explore in this 16-square-mile archaeological treasure trove.

Germany, Europe's largest and most prosperous country, is insisting that profligate countries implement deep cuts to public spending in return for aid, and refusing to endorse a broader role for the ECB. Germany's orthodoxy has isolated it within Europe and on the ECB's governing council. Many European leaders worry that national resentments could boil over if the crisis persists, destroying not just the euro but the EU itself.

Plan before you shop. Although there isn't one standard formula for figuring out correct food proportions, planning the meal ahead of time is one of the most important steps to getting it right. You need to decide what time of day the party will be, whether you'll serve meats or just light appetizers, and whether it will be a buffet-style or a sit-down meal.

In one way only, but a significant way, Mr. Cera reminds me of Billie Holiday, who achieved subtle marvels within a severely limited vocal range. His voice is breathy, wistful and piping, yet plaintive and emotive. His abstracted demeanor suggests an emotional range that is narrower still, yet his inhibitions are translucent, rather than opaque; directly behind them, intelligence seethes and passion smolders. It's remarkable that such a singular young actor—he's only 21—should have found so many worthy vehicles ("Superbad," "Juno," "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist") in such a short time, but he's done it again as Nick Twisp, the hero of "Youth in Revolt," which was directed with impressive flair by Miguel Arteta and adapted by Gustin Nash from the novels by C.D. Payne.

“Occidental and the oil industry as a whole have benefited from higher oil prices in the first quarter,” Gheit said. “Oil companies with reserves that are highly leveraged toward oil compared to natural gas will do very well.” Gheit went on to describe Occidental as one of the industry’s best-run companies, saying it had “few negatives.”
It's still easy to find 11th-hour mock drafts that have the Chargers picking an offensive lineman with their 18th overall pick. Can't buy it for a moment. Smith has addressed most every offensive need through free agency. He has to go defense, has to go defense plenty.
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood earlier this week cited the Sept. 29 European warnings in his decision to assess a record $16.4 million fine on the Japanese automaker for failing to alert the U.S. government to its safety problems quickly enough.

September and October are the most popular months for biking here: The weather is stable and the roads are no longer clogged with summer crowds. Bikers come to explore the sheer variety of Vineyard’s terrain. In its roughly 80 square miles, there’s everything from rolling farmland to dense forests, precipitous cliffs leading to vast expanses of beach, sand dunes alternating with fields of wildflowers, and water, water everywhere: ponds, marshes, coves and of course, the ocean.

Like schools statewide, Meadow Park's class sizes have been hit hard by the state's financial woes. The 20-to-1 pupil-teacher ratio in the primary grades disappeared last year, and the school now uses four roaming instructional aides to mitigate the impact.
With the Bears out of the playoff race, both teams will be playing for pride in Week 17, a dynamic capable of producing a wide variance of results. The Vikings showed some spunk last week, beating the Redskins after losing Christian Ponder and Adrian Peterson. The Bears were a serious postseason contender before Jay Cutler suffered a broken thumb and often play well in hopeless situations, so they figure to give a premium effort for Lovie Smith. But it doesn't take much for things to turn sour on the road.
Director Clara Van Gool’s wit and skill are evident in her filming of “Coup de Grâce,” a 2010 short in which dancers Jordi Cortés Molina and Damián Muñoz portray longtime friends and antagonists, wrestling and drinking wine in the baroque setting of an old radio broadcasting station. Van Gool, renowned for marvelous dance films like “Nussin” and “Enter Achilles,” was on hand later to discuss her work in person, revealing her search for narrative potential in dance and her desire to make dance credible in a realistic setting. Looking forward: Van Gool is working on a feature-length dance film inspired by Henry James’ novella “The Beast in the Jungle.”

Rants against gay marriage and illegal immigrants get traction among Republican primary voters because so many of them are older white people who tend to be fearful of such things.

Santorum had 30 percent support to 28 percent for Romney in a national poll released this week by the Pew Research Center. But the same poll said 31 percent of all adults had never heard of or couldn't rate him. That's a significantly higher number than for Romney, Gingrich, or Ron Paul. Even among Republicans, one in five told Pew they didn't know enough about Santorum to rate him.

This is a lot like living on a credit card and asking the bank for a higher limit, an analogy that Republicans happen to like, too.

"I guess I can say I was worried," Sanzenbacher said, "just because I wasn't sure. I had people asking me, and I said 'I'm not sure.' We had two plays called if we had to go back, but at that point in the game, at least we had another set of downs."

The Ducks are 10-4. It's a good start. They're 2-0 in conference play with road wins against two of the better teams. Wonderful. But that only increases the expectations. All Oregon has to do is protect home court and win two more road games to finish 13-5 in conference. Even in a down year for the Pac-10, that should be enough to make the NCAA field. If Oregon can't finish the job, the disappointment on selection Sunday will be too much to overlook.
Most citizens view the end of work each day as a clear line in dividing their responsibilities to an employer from their rights as an individual.

For example, the piece on EPA administrator Al Armendariz ("EPA official quits over ‘crucify' video," May 1). What the piece excludes is the most important part of the story. A small town in Texas of about 250 people had their well contaminated by chemicals and the EPA decided that it was caused by a fracking operation on private land nearby. They shut down the operation on the pretense that they had contaminated the well. It's the only way they can shut down drilling on private land, so energy prices can necessarily skyrocket, you know. Well, the company sued and it was found that the polutants were agriculture runoff that contaminated the well.

The largest driver for the May rate increase has been Xcel's decision to terminate its wholesale contract with Black Hills Energy, which serves Pueblo and the Arkansas River Valley. Xcel's request to have retail ratepayers make up for the lost revenue was strongly opposed by many experts testifying on Xcel's current rate increase. These experts pointed out that business decisions made on Xcel's wholesale side should not add to the financial burden of Xcel's retail customers who bore no responsibility for Xcel's decision.

By the way, another European currency worth paying attention to is the Swiss franc. It's trading at an all-time high against the dollar because investors see it as an alternative to the euro, according to John Doyle, a senior currency strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.

"All his life, Lyndon Johnson had made use of any political weapon on which he could lay his hands, or which he could invent, any power that he could find or devise, as a means to attain his ends," writes Caro, "and he employed these weapons to the hilt, with a ruthlessness startling even to men who believed themselves inured to the ruthlessness of politics."
The author's thesis applies to just about everyone, but especially to the young, the adolescent and the post-adolescent. Those groups are the chief subject of this book, as Walker wanders into almost frightening circles of under-30-year-olds to see what they are purchasing. Lots and lots of stuff, we are assured, but to reach this free-spending crowd you have to have the right attitude, "street cred."
"We're always working with the latest and greatest medical breakthrough therapies that have really significant impact on patients' lives," says Morel, who received a master's in business ddministration from Arizona State University.

The market's relative tranquility has made many analysts upbeat about the chances that its gains will hold. They say investors now have realistic not overoptimistic expectations. And the market has gotten used to the idea of a bumpy economic recovery, including the continuing struggles of the housing market. But analysts warn, for stocks to extend their January-March gains, investors will need to see employers hiring again.
"It's almost like as she got older and more confident in her own skin, she was more able to be there for me as well," she says.

Dallas assistant coach Wade Wilson is suspended for five games during the 2007 season for violating NFL rules on using performance-enhancing drugs. Wilson was suspended for buying and using performance-enhancing substances. He was also fined $100,000.
øBring to a Boyle: This series is tight enough that Brian Boyle's health could be an important factor. The 6-7 forward has been out of the lineup the past two games with a concussion, and his status is unknown. He had three goals and 19 hits in his first five games against Ottawa. Brandon Dubinsky didn't skate Friday. Boyle is important to the Rangers' secondary scoring. Joel Ward might be the player to look at for Washington to provide secondary scoring. He has a history of stepping up big in the postseason, shown again with his overtime winner in Game 7 against Boston.

Thomas Zaino, a member of the Ohio State Racing Commission and an attorney and certified public accountant, did an in-depth study and determined that it is constitutional to have VLTs, under the Ohio Lottery, at the racetracks. The commission, under the leadership of Chairman William Koester, then developed, in April of last year, the fairest gaming proposal ever devised, with license fees of $65 million per track and a tax rate of 50 percent.
"It's probably not the best situation for me, but I've got to do it," said Scott, who swept Ohio State freshman Logan Stieber in the final series. "If I go get a couple more wins in a couple weeks, I'll solidify my spot and show 'em I'm an Olympian."

Cannabis did not seem to be among the garnishes on the plate of spot prawns, whose heads were tempura-fried while still attached to the steamed bodies; it appeared as a flavor really only as part of an epazote puree dotting a shallow bowl of rice porridge with nettles and monkfish. Cannabis-infused butter seeped from an onion-bacon-potato tart served with roast culotte. Dinner finished with a jigger of panna cotta tinged with the burnt-citrus notes of the Chinese herb osmanthus, served with a cannabis-coconut oil "snow."
That caused a stir - Webster was known as a conservative community - but no more so than when she introduced sex education to the parish.

Yet it wasn't a skewed sense of humor that prompted such fanciful civic planning. The city sprawled forth out of necessity, straddling one of the richest mineral sites in the world. Mines produced nearly 3 million ounces of gold and more than 8 billion pounds of copper, plus silver, lead and zinc. By the early 1900s, Bisbee's population exceeded 20,000, making it a bona fide Western metropolis.
Which isn't to say that Prey isn't without controversy. Because it's been scrutinized so closely, potential weaknesses in Prey's methodology have been identified. Its primary problems are that Prey runs on your computer as a root system process; it does its business via shell scripts; and it seems to communicate with its servers in a manner that could be intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attack. All of the security experts I consulted agree that Prey could go about its work in a far more secure fashion. The concern isn't that Prey could do something to harm your system or your privacy, but that a third party could exploit these weaknesses to attack your system.

Foiled Again, a veteran pacer that captured the $100,000 Battle of Lake Erie at Northfield Park on July 23 against a well-matched field, sparkled last Saturday at Indiana Downs in Shelbyville, Ind. With Yannick Gingras driving, Foiled Again won the $205,000 Indiana Pacing Derby for Pennsylvania's Burke Racing Stable. Taking the lead at the quarter-mile, the 1-9 favorite paced a 1:49.2 mile. To make it a perfect night for the Burke Stable, Gingras also piloted their Hugadragon - another Dragon Again offspring - to victory in the $275,000 Monument Circle for three-year-old pacers in 1:50.4.

Neither the Patriots nor Mankins' agent, Frank Bauer, responded to requests for comment. Earlier Wednesday, team owner Robert Kraft said Mankins, entering his seventh season, probably would be signed soon.
As presented in Anthony Neilson’s cleverly conceived play, Dissocia is the alternately giddy and frightful wonderland of a troubled woman’s psyche. Lisa, a British woman in her 30s, is having trouble meeting her commitments and managing her life, in part because her watch has been running an hour slow, no matter how often she re-sets it. A mysterious representative of the watch-repair specialist shows up at Lisa’s flat and directs her to Dissocia in order to find her missing hour. The rest of Act I shows us her adventures there, where logic is Lewis Carroll-loopy and a sweet-natured populace has been warped by war-time fears of the enemy Black Dog King.

As the world’s No. 2 economy, China, needs oil and lots of it — some 10 million barrels a day. Until now it’s been heavily dependent on oil from the Middle East, especially from Iran. That supply has left Beijing vulnerable to the ups and down of Middle East geopolitics, including the recent Hormuz Straits blockade scare.

It was clear to me as a correspondent in Moscow in 1999 that Putin's toughness was key to his early appeal among Russians. He was a welcome antidote to the uncertainty and humiliation of the first post-Soviet decade, particularly after a string of terrorist bombings that autumn, widely blamed on Chechen separatists. In a comment that become a trademark of his earthy, sometimes vulgar style, Putin vowed to wipe out the perpetrators "in the outhouse."

That's why they had the paramedics come in, because they thought he might have punctured an artery because of how much blood was coming out.'"

The LMR meatballs ($13) show the kitchen is trying to appeal to the widest demographic. The meat was good, served on a bed of caramelized vegetables in a cast-iron casserole. With only three small meatballs, it seemed too expensive, and the tomato marmalade was as sweet as something you'd spread on breakfast toast; it overshadowed the grass-fed beef. The beef chile ($8) was better because you could taste the meat and the Rancho Gordo pinquito beans, buried in a vivid red sauce that more successfully balanced heat with sweet.

The real problem for Beinart's argument is that, in word and deed, Palestinians have repeatedly furnished good reasons for the Israeli (and American) right to argue against further territorial withdrawals, at least until something fundamental changes in Palestinian political culture. I supported disengagement from Gaza as editor of the Jerusalem Post. But it's hard to argue that the results have been stellar in terms of what a Palestinian state portends. Last year's murder of the Fogel family, horrifying as it was, wasn't nearly as disturbing as the public celebration of the killings among Palestinians. By contrast, when a Jordanian soldier murdered Israeli schoolgirls on a little island in the Jordan River in 1997, the late King Hussein personally begged the forgiveness of the bereaved Israeli families. (Alas, by still another contrast, Jordan's justice minister has demanded the imprisoned soldier's release, calling him a "hero.")
But a prospective president should care about rhetoric for deeper reasons: Because language and leadership are inseparable. Because history is not shaped or moved by mediocre words.

AmTrust had 596 accounts with more than $250,000, totaling $438.2 million. For any of those not covered by FDIC insurance because of the way they were structured, NYCB will pick up the loss that otherwise would have been absorbed by the FDIC.

At face value, this pick – whether they want to go Hill, Rueben Randle or even Mohamed Sanu – makes sense. Andre Johnson is not getting any younger, nor is the rest of that receiving corps. And if Arian Foster is going to stay relevant as a running back, Houston is going to need a new wrinkle in the passing game.

Maryland should not have needed a special session of the legislature — the General Assembly could easily have finished its business before its scheduled adjournment earlier this month. Now, after a meeting today among Gov.Martin O'Malley, House SpeakerMichael E. Buschand Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, there's talk about having two. In the bizarro world our State House has become, this is actually a sign of progress. It should allow lawmakers to correct the problems caused by their failure to pass two key budget measures without getting bogged down in a divisive (and entirely elective) debate about expanded gambling.
Family law attorney Jeffrey Matthews, of the Portland firm Yates, Matthews and Eaton, said any asset acquired during the course of a marriage, including through a pending divorce, is presumed to be a marital asset.
GET-THIN isn't the only outfit touting Lap-Band surgery.

In July, the Sheriff's Office paid $200,000 to settle a claim brought by two Hispanic men, one a U.S. citizen and the other a legal resident, who were detained during a worksite raid in 2009. U.S. District Judge David Campbell ruled in the spring that sheriff's deputies had no reason to stop the men before dawn outside of the worksite perimeter. An attorney for the Sheriff's Office said the agency had to settle the lawsuit because administrators could not identify the deputy who made the stop, making it impossible to defend the merits of the stop.
Groundbreaking for the Chicago Cubs new spring training stadium in Mesa is tentatively set for July 11.
Ascertaining whether or not a sale is illegal can be tricky. In the case of a live animal or a creature clearly on the endangered species list, like a tiger, the lines are well demarcated. But elephant ivory, for instance, can be sold legally, depending on its age and provenance, and sellers don’t often volunteer documentation that the ivory was obtained legally.

The Answer: I try to get to every job site regularly, so there's one-on-one contact with all of the people within the company. We do company cookouts where we have hot dogs, hamburgers, whatever, just to get together and talk. We have a management meeting off-site once a month just to get people out of the office. We usually go to a local restaurant and order some beers and some pizzas and just sit around and talk about issues that are of concern to everybody. People feel a little less stifled and are a little more open to discussing things.
