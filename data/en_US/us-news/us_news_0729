We're not allowed to get too close to the characters. The researchers are often dressed in elaborate protective gear -- plastic-bubble hoods, gloves, rubber boots -- and that's how we approach much of "Contagion," at arm's length, once removed, not feeling much loss for the mostly nameless dead. Shouldn't we be feeling more? Or is that part of the message -- that by the time the body count reaches into the millions, we're not feeling much of anything?

If you look at how that added revenue is being spent, it's hard to argue that students are getting a lot of extra value for all that extra money. Why? Colleges aren't spending their extra revenues, which we calculate to be about $40 billion a year nationally over 1980 revenues, in ways that most benefit students.

Interesting debate with who the Avs should pay more, Matt Duchene or Ryan O'Reilly. A four or five year deal with a cap hit between $5-$5.5 million seems fair for both, but do you see the Avs doing one of those mega-deals in terms of length of contract like Marian Hossa (12 years) and Jeff Carter (10 years)? After these signings do the Avs go after a big fish in free agency like Parise or Suter? If we are following the Pens and Blackhawks model, both those teams added free agents.

The dual threat is rare enough because most of the Cavs' "stretch" players have been catch-and-shoot guys, stapled to a favorite area of the floor or even to a favorite floorboard. See Donyell Marshall, Damon Jones, Boobie Gibson, Anthony Parker and to some extent the traded Zydrunas Ilgauskas.

Christie had won the first major battle of his administration, leaving political opponents who control the Legislature with little ammunition to wage war against his austere budget. They would accept his terms — and his way of doing business.

Most of the country will receive the Brad/Angelina issue today.
"The current standards in Ohio are outdated," said Stan Heffner, superintendent of the Ohio Department of Education. "So something that was designed in the late 1980s is still driving the system. But there is a big disconnect because the measures are not adequate for what the world requires of graduates, whether they choose to go to college or get a job."
"We didn't look anywhere but Willo," Andrea said.

Though CGI is used around the edges, most of this film is made, as "King Kong" and Aardman's own Oscar-winning "Wallace and Gromit" films were before it, in a time-honored method where physical objects are manipulated literally frame by frame to give the illusion of movement.
Lucas said tracking the mission appealed to all of her students.
Includes plentiful footnotes and a historical index for context.
It's a modest place, just one room with a few tables and chairs and a bar where Cuban sandwiches ($5.95 and $7.95) are assembled. Sandwiches (palomilla steak and pork, too) are served in plastic baskets, and iced tea comes in foam cups. Two murals evoke street scenes in Havana, where the brothers were born 55 years ago and left when their parents moved to Tampa when they were 3.

Some plants are tricky to divide, such as those with long, single roots called tap roots that go deep into the ground. These include balloon flowers, false indigo (baptisia) and Oriental poppies. If you split these the wrong way you can kill them. The trick: cut lengthwise down the root and make sure each piece has a bit of the side roots. If the main root has "eyes," the small round nubs from which a new stem emerges, make sure each baby you cut off has one of these.

How fun would it be if "Saturday Night Live" had some of that zip and zing? We were all thinking it.
I've expressed this concept in the past, and the faithful inevitably respond by flopping on the ground and declaring themselves hit, the victims of hatred and discrimination. If biology can teach that tadpoles become frogs, they insist, why not also teach that God took Adam's rib and made woman? I have learned not to spar with such people, but to simply share Samuel Johnson's classic line, "‘Sir, I have found you an argument. I am not obliged to find you an understanding." They usually don't reply to that, which is just as well.
Romney already has some Illinois dates nailed down. His campaign here is chaired by state treasurer Dan Rutherford - and is loaded with endorsements from the Illinois Republican establishment - and helped by major donors from the state on his national finance committee.

Boston closer Andrew Bailey will have surgery on his right thumb that could sideline him for a significant portion of the season.
This week, the focus in Annapolis will be on the state's 2013 budget and the compromise struck by the Senate's Budget and Taxation Committee over education spending.

Spain and Italy are trying to avoid the fate of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, which turned to bailout loans after skeptical bond markets wouldn't loan them money at affordable rates. The size of Spain and Italy's economies, the No. 4 and No. 3 in the 17-country eurozone, means they could be too expensive to rescue for the other euro countries.

Beyond Twitter's reputation, I wonder what broader impact the company hopes this will have. Messinger said first, Twitter hopes that many other startups and VCs will embrace it. Some of these small companies will be tomorrow's giants, after all.
Adams and Patterson were taken to Wishard Memorial Hospital. The children, who were not injured, are staying with their grandmother.
In some circles, yeah. The novelty stigma has always followed me.
If Celtics star Ray Allen could go to the bench without sulking, certainly someone like Collison, who doesn't have a tenth of Allen's pedigree, can do it without going in the tank.
Born Shifra Meyerowitz on July 18, 1926, she grew up in New York steeped in the leftist politics of her parents, Jewish immigrants from Russia and Poland. She attended the city's High School of Music and Art before moving to Los Angeles in the 1940s.
Wrap lettuce around the filling to enclose, or serve open faced on a plate.
Perhaps things would have unfolded differently had Oakland cashed in during the first inning. A double steal by Jemile Weeks and Coco Crisp put runners on second and third with one out. But Cespedes took a fastball for strike three, and the inning ended with Suzuki flying out to right with the bases loaded.
Q. My question for you is regarding summer birthdays and kindergarten. I 100 percent agree with California changing its policy to require children in the near future to be 5 years old by Sept. 1 in order to start kindergarten. I am struggling with a child who has a summer birthday. My youngest child turns 5 this summer and I can either send or give a "bonus year." I have gotten so many mixed messages on this one and find it really challenging to make the right decision. Even the preschool teacher says she could make a case either way for many of those with summer birthdays.

Congress needs to vote this one down. Mr. Obama's claim that this latest stimulus will be fully paid for is just another myth and lie. He wants to pay for this unworkable plan by overtaxing families earning $200,000 or more annually.
“It’s a serious project to benefit cancer research and education, but it’s also a fun one,” Katie said.

The wider agreement would eliminate tariffs on more than 95 percent of industrial and consumer goods within five years, a move that the U.S. International Trade Commission estimated would increase exports of U.S. goods by at least $10 billion. The deal would also open up South Korea's vast $560 billion services markets to U.S. companies.
"I just decided to make a move and try to get off his body and eliminate his athletic ability," Sullinger said.
I'm ceaselessly amazed at how the oligarchic Tribune editorial board can on one hand call public teachers as lazy, union-protected unprofessionals and — sometimes using the same hand — cry aghast as the best-educated, most qualified professionals seek career security anywhere but Illinois schools. Who'd a-thunk it? Certainly not the Tribune, which pummels teachers daily, which somehow believes teachers, nurses, firefighters, police officers and other public servants are to blame for decades of legislative malfeasance.
The task force presented Christie with its report shortly after Thanksgiving. But the governor waited until Monday to make the proposal public.

4. Downshift on pizza and other teen salt bombs. The single largest source of sodium in teen diets is pizza, so make it a once-a-month treat -- and start with a big salad so a couple of slices fill them up. Cutting back on salt now will cut your teens' risk for high blood pressure later by 63 percent. Got a kid who loves to cook? Try making 100 percent whole-wheat pizza together with low-salt sauce and tons of vegetables.

Another option might be former Rams quarterback A.J. Feeley, who served as Sam Bradford's mentor in 2010 in St. Louis, when Shurmur was offensive coordinator. An 11-year veteran and current free agent, Feeley was drafted by the Eagles in the fifth round of 2001 when Shurmur and Childress were there and spent six seasons as a backup over two stints. In 2002, he came off the bench and won three of four starts to keep the Eagles' playoff bid alive until McNabb returned from injury.

The episode prompted the commission to develop a set of guidelines meant to restore civility and prevent residents from feeling intimidated when testifying.
His audience liked what they heard.
Dream 2.0 is "not perfect," Jacoby concedes. She believes it is acceptable because it is better than nothing. I disagree. The whole point of the original Dream Act was not to punish undocumented youth for the illegal acts of their parents. Dream 2.0 would do the opposite, giving them something other than the green cards that provide them the promise of citizenship and full status as Americans. Jacoby wonders if an immigrant parent might accept Dream 2.0 for their child; I would ask her the same question: Would she accept second-class status for her kid?
"I would have like to have played better today and gone further and see how it would have turned out," said Young, whose ATP record was 19-53 entering the tournament. "To win four rounds and get to the semis, for me, is a positive and a triumph. Hopefully, it's the first of many."

Instead, Emanuel deferred to Obama, who said this week that aides suggested leaders of the Group of Eight nations would be more comfortable in the intimate and informal setting of the presidential retreat in the Maryland woods.
It is a daunting proposition. Luck knew in advance that the Colts would take him, and he had plenty of time to come up with the perfect answers to questions about replacing Manning. He managed to deliver them without sounding rehearsed.
Much as founder Gustave Niebaum employed 34 men year-round to tend his property, Coppola and his staff employ much of their vineyard crew full time, a departure from the valley's typical use of migrant labor.
Philadelphia 4, New Jersey 3, OT, Philadelphia leads series 1-0
Ancient Mesoamericans practiced a primitive form of aquaponics, cultivating plants on rafts on lakes. Modern aquaponics systems were developed in recent decades by several researchers, including James Rakocy at the University of the Virgin Islands.

Many visitors like to get away from the train station as soon as possible and out toward the temples to the north and east. But I suggest visitors linger. This helps set up the juxtaposition from new to old that makes Kyoto so special. Stay the night at Granvia, a sleek boutique hotel that feels transplanted from New York. Rooms are large (and come with a discount if you have a Japan Rail Pass). They look out at the bullet trains – called shinkansen – coming and going below. Visit the malls and eat in a subterranean restaurant. Some visitors will stay the entire trip to Kyoto at the Granvia because they can get so much more hotel room for their yen than if they stay in traditional ryokan guesthouses in the older districts.

Unsatisfied with those theories, I did an Internet search for the meaning behind dog days. It quickly turned up a number of similar explanations. According to various sources, the origin of dog days can be traced all the way back to ancient Greeks and Romans, based on positions of stars in the summer sky. The Romans had identified Sirius, the dog star, as the brightest point of light in the constellation Canis Major (which means big dog). Sirius and the other big dog stars only appeared during the hottest times of the year, so those early astronomers logically matched the canine name to the nasty weather.

But she's not stupid or naive. She's just an idealist, one of those later-day hippie types who thinks individuals really can make the world a better place. Today, she's slowly working toward a master's degree in conflict resolution and serves on Portland's volunteer Human Rights Commission. It was her work on disability issues that led her to testify at City Council against the sidewalk ordinance.

But the kitchen redeems itself with its cilantro soy marinated beef ($14), a thinly sliced New York strip steak soaked in soy sauce that you "grill" yourself on a tiny tabletop grill bursting with flame. What fun. And it is really good, too, the soy and fresh cilantro giving the paper-thin circles of beef quite a kick.
"It was fun, man," James said. "He's one of the most competitive players I've ever played against in a playoff series."

What's more, researchers hope to determine how similar apes and humans are when it comes to cardiac disease. The hearts look the same on an ultrasound, but that doesn't necessarily mean that disease affects them the same way. Already, the oldest orangutan at Zoo Atlanta, 40-year-old Alan, is taking human prescription drugs to help arrest the spread of his heart disease. However, researchers aren't sure how effective the drugs are because there is so little data on what a healthy orangutan heart looks like.

It tackles existential struggles that many of us grapple with — and the film industry virtually ignores — while doing so in an entertaining way. It lampoons the traditions of both conservative Christians and politically correct liberals (lots of costumes here), yet has a soft spot for them both. And it has a strong central performance from Marshall Allman, who plays Don and gives this film its heart.
Gonzalez’s fellow cabbies were trying to raise money to pay for the services.
Last year, a Post-Dispatch series on the region's economy - "Can St. Louis Compete?" - found that the area continues to lag behind the nation in the creation of new companies and that local startups had difficulties attracting venture capital.

Many economists and labor market experts caution against making month-to-month comparisons, especially with figures that are not seasonally adjusted. Unadjusted figures don't take into account how the labor market changes given the time of year. For example, unemployment often spikes in January as holiday workers lose jobs, and companies are more apt to lay off workers because of a slowdown in business due to bad weather.

His country-by-country analyses succeed admirably, picking up on telling threads that even specialists will have missed. Why, for example, do the super-rich Mexican Carlos Slim and Brazilian Eike Batista behave differently than top billionaires Mukesh Ambani in India and Ahmet Calik in Turkey? Why do South African gold producers' stock prices fall when global gold prices rise? What does the price of a bellini in Rio have to do with Brazilian state oil giant Petrobras?

The endemic corruption is one reason many analysts think China faces a period of political instability as it consolidates the fantastic economic gains of recent years. As prosperous as the new China may appear, it's also riddled with networks of corrupt power and privilege -- and managed by a nervous elite that is transferring ill-gained loot to foreign bank accounts before it gets caught.

It certainly isn’t tight end. Losing Kevin Boss to a four-year, $16 million deal in Oakland is a blow to Eli Manning’s offense, especially when his supposed replacement, Ben Patrick, retired two days later. The Giants have few obvious options to upgrade from Travis Beckum before the season.

Their first two houses were traditional bungalows in South City. When their oldest daughter was starting school, they planned a move to the county, setting their sights on the Clayton School District. But when they started looking, they discovered that all of the houses in Clayton in their price range needed complete remodeling - a challenge they just weren't up to. They were fortunate enough to sell their city house quickly, but with no new house to move into, they started perusing rental properties as a temporary solution.
"I have never had a high regard for any form of ethnic, racial or religious-themed schools," said Diane Ravitch, a prominent education historian and author at New York University.

Not all, or even most, classical music is "about" something; you can't always so precisely match up a text like "The people that walked in darkness" with the meandering melody that Handel provided for it in "Messiah." Nevertheless, in a more general way, the composers of the music on the program Saturday night at Powell Symphony Hall invited this kind of analysis.

FirstEnergy's response to both proposals, also included in the report to shareholders, is that they be rejected.
I always hate it when the artist gets in the apparatus suspended by wires over the crowd. It happens at most arena shows, and I always have the same reaction: what if the wires snap? The spectacle is never worth the anxiety. I had extra special levels of anxiety during the final encore, because if there is one artist I do not want to see fall to her death in the middle of the Prudential Center, that artist is Taylor Swift. I don't think I could handle that. Sure enough, no sooner is Swift up and over the crowd than the cradle begins to rock. Steely pop warrior she is, she only looks terrified for a split-second. She puts her hand on the rail of the balcony, as if to steady it, which is of course impossible, because she's thirty feet off the ground. The crew gets her out of there quick, but at an inopportune time -- Swift keeps on singing, but she's in the pit and running to get onstage for the song's climax. I'm not disappointed. I am happy to see that Taylor Swift is not the sort of woman who is ready to die for her art. I wasn't sure about that.
I am not too low-brow, however, to acknowledge that there were a couple of glaring omissions from the list.
Thompson went 11 of 22 from the field and 5 of 12 from 3-point range, had 4 rebounds and 4 assists and moved into 3rd place on the Wildcats' career scoring list. He also broke Brian Cardinal's single-game scoring record of 33 points, set in 1999 when Cardinal's Purdue team lost to Michigan.

A hotel in Hawaii is Peter's vacation destination of choice after his break-up. The script's plot twist of choice has Sarah, a TV star played by Kristen Bell, ensconced in the same hotel with her new squeeze, a fatuous British rock star played, quite charmingly, by Russell Brand. This is a first feature for both the writer and director -- they're members of the loosely organized repertory company run by Judd Apatow, the man behind such megahits as "Knocked Up" and "The 40 Year Old Virgin" -- and they keep their respective debuts free from contamination by subtlety. The movie looks like "The Love Boat" run aground -- lots of ludicrous locals. Peter wallows in repetitive grief while his ex and her rocker revel in each other next door. Halfway through, however, I realized that I'd lost most of my standards, maybe under my seat, and was enjoying the erratic evolution of the nonsense.

(05-11) 10:08 PDT Des Moines, Iowa (AP) --
What concerns us is the feeling of fullness you have after eating white foods. We suggest you get tested for celiac disease. The symptoms you're describing -- bloating, diarrhea, sore back -- are associated with this condition. The source is a sensitivity to gluten, a protein found in certain grains, such as wheat, rye and barley, and in some weird stuff like some toothpastes and beer. For people with celiac disease, gluten damages intestinal villi, hairlike structures in your intestines that slow food absorption so your body has time to extract vital nutrients.
Sounds to me like he’s been watching too much “Boardwalk Empire”! I understand where you’re coming from; it definitely sounds a little weird. Us girls only have one daddy in our life. Hearing our boyfriends refer to themselves as “daddy” while they’re banging us is a definite turn-off. Probably what’s behind him saying it is needing to feel in control of you, to dominate. If that part of the sexual chemistry works for you, I would try replacing “daddy” with another word, like “man.” He’ll be saying, “Who’s your man?” You’ll respond with, “You are, you’re my man.”

Sawyer estimated a third of Noodlecat's customers are vegetarian, or at least eat that way at the 80-seat restaurant. So it's surprising to discover only two of the 11 noodle dishes are meat-free.

Florida courts have been overwhelmed in recent years by the avalanche of foreclosures clogging the system.

"They can be very patchy in their distribution," said Rob Lawrence, a forest entomologist for the Missouri Department of Conservation. "One thing to consider is what was the tree cover and forest like in that area 13 years ago, or two or three generations ago?

ø•Franklin Gutierrez was the Seattle Mariners' center fielder in spring training but was shelved by a torn chest muscle. Now he's dealing with plantar fasciitis in his heel, so he could be out well into May or longer. In his absence, post-hype prospect Michael Saunders has run with the job early, flashing a .515 slugging percentage while displaying solid patience (nine walks in 76 plate appearances).

In a Seattle lineup that is power-starved, Saunders is establishing himself as a bat that simply can't be on the bench.

The violence and destruction of the May Day protests in Oakland and San Francisco were beyond the pale, which seems to have become the norm for Occupy.
