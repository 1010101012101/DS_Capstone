If not for running out of bounds to stop the clock in regulation and fumbling in overtime, Marion Barber would have been a hero last week. He rushed for 108 yards and a nine-yard touchdown and made a diving catch for a 16-yard gain in OT. The Bears figure to attack a Seahawks run defense ranked 11th in the NFL, not only with Barber but with a heavier dose of Kahlil Bell (13 carries, 74 yards in his last two games).

Two weeks ago, investigators passed out fliers featuring her picture. Kyron's father has moved out, filed for divorce and won a restraining order keeping her away from their 19-month-old daughter. Kyron's mother urged Terri Horman this week to "fully cooperate" with police. Yet the boy is still missing, and Multnomah County Sheriff Dan Staton pointedly declined an opportunity during a Friday news conference to come right out and name Horman a suspect and raised the specter of this eventually becoming a cold case.

A mile and a half from Apple's Cupertino headquarters is De Anza College, a community college that Steve Wozniak, one of Apple's founders, attended from 1969 to 1974. Because of California's state budget crisis, De Anza has cut more than 1,000 courses and 8 percent of its faculty since 2008.
Adreian Payne and Nix, the two-man menace at center, missed easy shots and got easily frustrated. Part of that was Louisville's defense -- Gorgui Deng blocked seven shots -- but a lot of it was just bad shooting. I'm in favor of shooters using the glass. It's a lost art. But the ball should hit the rim, too.
Ed Yardeni, a prominent Wall Street financial analyst, advocates a new Homestead Act, like the one that passed in 1862 to encourage the settlement of the West. He envisions a matching government subsidy of up to $20,000 for any homeowner who puts up at least the same amount and has been approved for a mortgage on a primary home. The program would be capped at 2 million existing single-family homes, with a cost of $40 billion.

A Hetch Hetchy initiative headed for the local San Francisco ballot this November could be a donneybrook. Statewide fights over taxes and capital punishment could pale by comparison.

Most people, however, stay with their bank out of inertia. If you're not willing to shop around, you'd better read carefully any fee notices you get from your bank. The debit card you know and love may not be the same after July 21.
"Realm Variations" was commissioned by the San Francisco Symphony for the orchestra's piccolo player, Catherine Payne, and Monk took the opportunity to craft a knowing and deeply felt meditation on the interplay between instruments and voices. Scored for six singers and seven instrumentalists, the piece plays a little with contrasts of range: Monk divides her forces into low-pitched, medium and high-pitched groups, reserving the starkest opposition for that between the piccolo and contrabass clarinet.
"Any additional filings by the ACLU does not change the city’s position that we are fully capable of managing our police department," city spokeswoman Esmeralda Diaz Cameron said. "The city will continue to work with other law enforcement agencies at the state and federal level to protect and serve our residents and to further improve NPD operations."

The past two springs, McClellan has been competing for a spot in the rotation. A year ago he threw 23 innings over five starts to win Adam Wainwright's open spot. He followed that with a career-high 141 2/3 innings during the season. Former pitching coach Dave Duncan liked to condition McClellan as a starter each spring because it afforded McClellan the innings he needed to refine the four pitches - fastball, cutter, curve and change-up - that he would use as a late-inning reliever.
What would we get for the additional money? There is no evidence that private insurers drive down the cost of health care better than the federal government -- the Medicare Advantage program (Medicare pays private insurers to offer Medicare benefits) shows just the opposite: It costs more than standard Medicare. But, say the advocates, premium support would give seniors a choice.
To take Siegrist's place in the River Bandits six-man rotation, the Cardinals moved RHP Boone Whiting into the a starting role. Whiting is 0-0 with a 1.29 ERA in 15 appearances for Quad Cities. He has 32 strikeouts with eight walks in 28 innings.

we are with each other, until you can tell me you think I am going to hell and until I can tell you I think you worship a Jewish heretic, we will never be able to truly break though the armor that protects us from seeing the world through each other's eyes, and never really learn from each other's theology."

The researchers, led by Sullivan's colleague at the institute, Xing Xu, examined the fossils with extra rigor to confirm their authenticity because they were discovered not by scientists but by independent collectors who sold them to Chinese museums. That practice often creates issues for scientists, who usually glean crucial information about these long-dead creatures from the land in which they were found. In this case, the researchers don't know exactly where the Y. huali skeletons were unearthed.

"Unfortunately, with this new Senate bill 1070 it really has impacted the entire Hispanic community, and anybody that has a business that catered to the Hispanic community has been impacted," Weymouth said. "It appeared to me that people were leaving the state before the bill passed. I also felt the Hispanic population be it legal or illegal were fearful of the whole thing. I felt that that really disrupted business. We had to come up with a concept that wasn't going to be affected. They're not going to put a bill that is against cowboys."

The study may put the nation's all-volunteer military force in a bind, so long as economic news remains bad on the home front and combat operations continue abroad. Those looking to escape economically stressed communities and their problems have presented the armed services with a recruitment bonanza in recent years. But sending those with vulnerabilities to post-traumatic stress disorder off to war may be a more and more costly proposition for the nation once they return.
Although he had been fairly successful in the early ’70s, his career took off in 1975 when he starred in a Spanish-language version of “Jesus Christ Superstar.” “The idea came to me after seeing the play in London,” says Sesto. “I returned to Spain completely insane and willing to do everything in my power to make the project a reality.

Those few pastors who agree with your position, Erik, try all kinds of "clever" techniques to circumvent the law. Recently, we reported a Tennessee pastor who had said during a Sunday sermon that he could not tell people who to vote for in the upcoming school board election. Instead, he reported that when he appeared earlier in the week on a local radio show, he endorsed three candidates and then named them. Brilliant! Well, not really; more like sleazy. Curiously, all three of the minister's favored candidates lost the election.

Still, who else in the wide-open Republican field can generate so much buzz? Who else inspires such visceral, inchoate devotion? Among her fans -- the kind of folks who would flood the Iowa caucuses in the winter of 2012 -- she is essentially critic-proof, much like a badly-written best-selling pulp novel. The more she is attacked for lack of substance, the more they love her. The more she is successfully fact-checked by the "elite," the tighter the ties with those who feel similarly aggrieved.

The hit-or-miss fate of a given Hollywood big-budget movie doesn't normally matter that much. Media company analysts discount the studios as too volatile to be given much credit inside large conglomerates.

Part of Barbaro's mystique came from Matz himself, a three-time Olympian who won a silver medal and carried the United States flag in the closing ceremony at the 1996 Games. His teammates had chosen him for the honor in part because of his heroism after a plane crash in 1989.

In my career I've been fortunate enough to be able to travel all over the country and in different times all over the world. I really think that home is where your heart is and, for me, my wife being from here . . . that it was hard for me to think of anyplace better. The experiences I've been able to have here were really just once-in-a-lifetime experiences. Being a part of this city and seeing what the (Pinnacle) team I was on was able to accomplish, it was hard for me to walk away. But seeing how happy my wife and my kids are here made it even more difficult to look elsewhere right now.

McVey, the sculptor, asked Kubin to help him wrestle with the star problem: to mock up various model stars in plywood, at a 1:40 scale. They'd position each model atop a construction-site water tower, precisely 564 inches off the ground, to see how a similarly scaled star would look atop the monument. McVey would walk around the water tower, studying the model, then suggest adjustments. Then Kubin would make yet another star.
resources, whether they be monetary, human or other, doesn't mean that you can't effectively market your beer or your brewery. You just need to utilize the resources you have to work with. I'm not the first to say this, but beer is a social beverage. Thus, as a small brewery, I'd say it's our duty to communicate with the community of craft-beer drinkers via different social media.

Just three days earlier he put in a 16-mile morning run, plus 45 minutes on a stationary bike, then cranked out a five-mile run with a 3,200-foot elevation gain in that evening.
How could such an outrageous recommendation come from a school board in times like these? We don’t need a state-of-the-art football field in a playpen palace. We need a focus on improving the academic excellence of our children. Measured against children throughout the world, our kids have become, at best, mediocre.
Rebecca's grim prognosis couldn't help but take its toll on the doctors and nurses working so hard to save her life. We labored to mask our sadness and worry from Rebecca and her parents as we offered medicines and hope.
