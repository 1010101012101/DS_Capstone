Chupacabra (new in 2011) - Plenty of great scares in a maze consisting largely of painted plywood corridors. The legendary Latin American creature makes for a compelling back story, although the spandex-clad beast portrayed in the maze was almost laughable. (X2 plaza)
Assemble an alternate Taste using local restaurants? Did it. A back-and-forth between me and a Taste first-timer? Yep.
Lou Preston's big gamble looks to have played out quite well. When I last visited Preston and his artist wife, Susan, a decade ago, they were a little more than a year into a business decision virtually unheard of in the California wine trade.

But what matters here is not the school's reputation.
Then again, Akron didn't claim the regular-season title in 2011 (fourth) and 2009 (third), and OU (fifth) didn't in 2010. They all got hot in the MAC Tournament, while teams with better seasons fell by the wayside, or simply came up one possession short.
People will be able to buy and read e-books through a Nook application for Windows 8, a new incarnation of Microsoft's operating system that is due to appear in a few months. Microsoft will pay NewCo an advance of $180 million over three years for such purchases, plus $125 million over five years to buy content and develop technology. The squabbles over patents have been settled: Microsoft is giving Barnes & Noble a license for the Nook and will get royalties in return. For now at least, the Nook will remain an Android, not Windows, device.

Crichton said the Tuesday morning meeting coach Riley alluded to earlier was not 15 minutes of talking up Stanford as a Mission Impossible opponent. "Nothing different today,'' said Crichton.

"Up" soars like the high-flying balloons central to its story. You may have a better time at the movies this year, but I can't imagine it. Yes, that's the kind of thing you read in a movie review and roll your eyes at, thinking it must be hyperbole. But in this case, it's genuine and heartfelt.
The debate will pit Republicans who blame high gasoline prices on Obama who, in turn, blames Republicans for coddling Wall Street.

The images of dead Bengal tigers, lions and grizzly bears piled next to each other in a makeshift grave under an overcast sky gripped the nation and brought Kasich increased scrutiny after it was learned that he let expire an executive order signed late last year by outgoing Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland.
But Romney, unlike Clinton, is not offering a program through which government would take specific steps to solve the problems he catalogs. Instead, he is calling on voters to share his faith that our difficulties would go away if the state simply got out of the way, allowed the market do its thing, and counted on the success of the successful to lift up everyone else.
But it's the creative drive that's significant -- not the scale, nor the buildings, nor the big names attached.
The off-screen banter of Taylor and Burton (she mocked his pock-marked face, he insulted her overripe figure) had become less loving, more loathing. They divorced in 1974. They remarried in 1975, then divorced again the following year. They kept hundreds of tabloid journalists in perpetual business.
His remarks hinted that his brother will decide to resume training for Endeavour's flight to the space station.
Tucker Cipriano talked frequently and aggressively about murder with his friends, telling one "he would beat someone to death or he would chop them up and feed them to the person's family," police reports indicate.

Dolan, the GOP's endorsed candidate, argued throughout the primary campaign that the Democratic machine would not be easily dismantled unless the party nominated a well-funded candidate. It is a contention he uses to defend large contributions from his wealthy relatives.

The contest has sounded alarms among electronic privacy advocates, who see ominous overreaching in the Manhattan prosecutor's efforts to subpoena tweets sent by a demonstrator facing a disorderly conduct charge. The protester's lawyer is trying to block the subpoena, calling it an infringement on constitutional rights and "an unwarranted invasion of privacy."
TOM: That’s exactly what your boyfriend needs, vis-a-vis his dying heap of a Taurus. He probably knows from his work that the first thing a dying patient and his family have to do is face the reality that the end is near. Your boyfriend is doing just the opposite: He’s whistling past the junkyard. This car is like a guy who’s had eight heart attacks and is still eating three cheese-steaks a day: It could expire at any moment. And when it goes, it’ll be without warning, and most likely the engine will just rev up but the car won’t move. That may not sound terribly dangerous — unless you happen to be making a left turn across traffic or crossing a railroad track.

"You don't buy a house because it is a good nest egg. You buy it because you want a stable home, a place to start a family. It's an expense," says Valenti.
"You can get lost in it a little bit, and you can't make pure art there in commercial-writer land," he says. "I've never said this before, but getting all of that so early on ended up being a steroid, a false growth hormone, where you have something real and it's multiplied 10 times faster and stronger and bigger than anyone was prepared for. It made us bigger than the planet. Everything that came after it is gauged by that initial success."
But the court panel said "the commissioner does not have the discretion to assign offenders to the ADTC whom the legislature has determined should not be treated there."
Congress' appropriations process may offer one more chance to go to bat for NASA Glenn. The old united front needs to be there.
The Friday night pig roast always is a big draw. On Front Street, 14 food vendors sell asparagus dishes for no more than $5 a plate.
Final Notes
Glenn's attitude, for 69 years, has been that good work should speak for itself. That's fine in theory, and it nicely mirrors the small-town Ohio values of the former astronaut and senator whose name has been attached to the center since 1999. But in the real world, it puts Glenn at a disadvantage next to show horses such as NASA Marshall in Huntsville, Ala., where they figured out long ago that corporate and political allies are invaluable when Washington starts to divvy up resources.

(National Geographic, 10 p.m.)
Children are our future. Drive anywhere near a school, a park or a playground, and you will encounter topes. These might be a concrete island across the road, or they might be a row of metal half spheres that will eat your undercarriage for breakfast if they don't flip your car over. Topes are also a given at any village on any country road, and at random intervals just about anywhere — including 50 yards after you pass a 100 km per hour speed limit sign. You'll often see a warning sign, but sometimes the bumps appear out of nowhere (and at other times the sign appears but the topes do not). You are going to slow down, either to ease over the topes or to ask around for a repair shop. There's no fighting it, so consider it your contribution to the welfare of the country's children.
Instead, the researchers report, surface waters in Lake Baikal are warming quickly, on average by about 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit every decade.

"You've just to get a feel for it," he said. "You have to stand in there and take a hit. If you throw a good ball and you take a shot to the chin, it's always a little more fun.
Vista del Mar also seeks to bridge the ever-widening compatibility gap between preteen and parent by hosting a triannual, nighttime event called the Survivor Book Club. Hundreds of students and their parents descend on the campus for a one-hour group discussion about a book that they have all read in the weeks prior. Students are picked by their language arts teachers to lead the discussions, and parents are always grouped with their own children.

The modest rise in sales followed a similar report Thursday that showed sales of previously occupied homes rose in August from depressed levels in July.

Gregg Eldred, an information technology worker with NextStep Technologies in Avon Lake, said he has an iPad for work, but he ordered a Fire for personal use.

Both "The Partridge Family" and "The Monkees" were series about fake bands played by actors. Both had real hit songs. But in the 1966-68 musical sitcom "The Monkees," Jones (the heartthrob), Dolenz (the shameless clown), Tork (a stoner type before the popularization of stoners) and Nesmith (the relatively sane, Country-ish one in the knit cap) went by their real names. And they really sang on the records. And they really toured as the band. So ...

"They have numerous options under our proposal," said Fran Migliorino, Brooklyn's economic development director.
You would think that an industry that just 15 months ago nearly cratered the world economy might be a little apologetic. You would think that, having been bailed out and newly enriched by taxpayers' money, the industry might be humbled enough to help make sure it couldn't happen again.

I am elated that the president stopped the Canadian tar sands oil pipeline that would have run through the heartland of America. It was not widely reported that this environmentally unfriendly, costly, unrefined oil likely would have been exported to Europe and used for heating oil. Canadian oil companies would make lots of money, but the oil produced would not benefit the United States in any way.

The Reds are counting on a new and improved local cable deal in the next few years. They can also expect increased revenues from Major League Baseball's TV deal and new media sources. But even if their payroll some day climbs to $100 million as some projections go, they'll be paying one player 22 percent of that. A player who in the last half of the contract, if not longer, will be fighting diminishing skills (that phrase never gets old, does it?).

Whenever a sorcerer enters the scene, or a demon flits across the page, some kind of literary depreciation effect still sets in (though the tide is changing). If you really want a serious, high-minded lesson from a book, the old prejudice goes, it has to come from somewhere else: usually those stories that cling with white knuckles to realism.

And don't call his spin on fish soup or stew a chowder. In fact, the name of the dish on the Raglan Road menu is "It's not bleedin' chowder!" ($25). Dundon combines seasonal seafood and potatoes in a white wine infused broth. To me, it's fabulously cioppino-light, referring to the Italian-American fish stew that originated in San Francisco. The "light" comes from the judicious use of the creamy broth to form a shallow pool. That lets the plump mussels, sweet shrimp and other ingredients shine in taste and texture.
Despite its imperfections, I'm hoping "Tickled Pink" represents the start of an ongoing relationship between the Rudner/Bergman team and the playhouse.

Next, a new Arizona law may soon go into effect regarding one's U.S. citizenship status and right to be in the U.S. The new law would require police officers in Arizona to question anyone about their immigration status if an officer suspects the person may be in the country illegally, including anyone who looks or sounds foreign. Those found to be here illegally could be jailed up to six months and fined $2,500. Do you favor or oppose the governor signing such a law if it is sent to her by the legislature?

Ashley Fox, ESPN.com: "There is no place in the game for Williams. There is no place in the game for purposely targeting the ‘outside ACL' of any player. There is no place in the game for specifically targeting the head of an opposing player with a concussion history. There is no place in the game for trying to 'clip' another player's ankles. Football, by nature, is a violent sport. We all know this. Bad things happen at the bottom of piles. Eyes get poked. Players get hurt. Big hits will always be a part of the game, no matter how hard Goodell tries to legislate against them. The NFL isn't flag football, nor should it be. But there has to be a line. There is play, and then there is dirty, disgusting, deplorable play. Gregg Williams crossed the line."

ABOUT THE MAGIC: Forward Ryan Anderson is in the midst of an ill-timed disappearing act. Anderson has been tormented by West and is averaging just 7.7 points and shooting 31.8 percent from the field. Anderson made an NBA-high 161 3-pointers during the regular season but is just 5 of 15 from behind the arc in the series. "He's going to have to put a lot more into the game," Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. "It's not going to be easy now for him. It's the playoffs - people are going to make adjustments and they've made a conscious effort to take him out and he's not going to get some easy things he got all year."
Chilo Rachal (San Francisco): He is 6-5, 323 pounds and he’s only 26 years old, but consistency certainly has been an issue. Rachal started 15 games in 2009 and 14 in 2010, but he was replaced on the 49ers’ starting offensive line this past season. The former second-round pick has some upside. He was ranked by Pro Football Focus as the top run-blocking guard in 2010, and he’s currently ranked by Pro Football Talk as the top remaining free agent guard available. However, it’s difficult to imagine Ravens coach John Harbaugh advocating the addition of a player that his brother, Jim, demoted from the starting lineup because of his penchant for committing penalities. Rachal has already visited the Rams.

That positive role model becomes all the more important since Egypt's Freedom and Justice Party looks unlikely to provide it. The party has two women among its 12 party leaders, but the Muslim Brotherhood, from which it springs, has none in its innermost circle.

But MetroHealth faces additional pressures. Because it is a public hospital, with buildings owned by the county and an annual $36 million subsidy from taxpayers, MetroHealth has undergone scrutiny from the new county leaders about how it spends its money. Cuyahoga County Councilman Dave Greenspan has raised questions about the amount the health system pays in consulting contracts both for those individuals and companies that currently do work at the system and for employees who have left the system.

You'll see Solomonov most nights working dough in front of the wood-fired taboon oven, dusting sesame and spice atop the pliant scrolls of warm laffa pita that come to each table, often with a plate of the planet's silkiest hummus (try the buttered Turkish variation) and a wrought-iron tree of eight "salatim." Don't skip these unique little salads, which, ranging from beets in tahini to winter tabbouleh with apple, pomegranate, and walnuts, hint at Solomonov's gift for vegetables.

Romney provided fresh grist for the debate Monday when he told a reporter in Ohio that he actually deserved "a lot of credit" for the resurgence in the domestic auto industry. Although he opposed the government loans to keep struggling General Motors and Chrysler afloat in 2008 and 2009, Romney said he "pushed the idea" of a managed bankruptcy. He said his idea eventually was adopted, and "I'll take a lot of credit for the fact that this industry has come back."

The room, which UCLA is promoting as "the birthplace of the Internet," is not meant to be a completely authentic historical display. The dimensions don't match the original space exactly, and during the official opening of the site on Oct. 29, Fidler happily allowed a photographer to climb atop the 1960s-era desk to take a picture of the crowd below. That relaxed, slightly improvisatorial approach to history makes the room a good match for a city known for its inherent informality.
Zamboni, now a legal resident, was among 45 people who testified during a public hearing before the House Rules Committee on Senate Bill 742, which would allow undocumented students living in Oregon to pay resident tuition at the state's seven public universities as they already can in California, Washington and nine other states.

KTRS never became a significant factor in the ratings despite the presence of the Cardinals, something many observers consider almost unfathomable. KTRS went to an ill-conceived rabble-rousing format shortly after gaining the Cards (at the behest of programmers hired by the club, not station GM Tim Dorsey). Despite eventually ending that approach, it never recovered.

The quintet played a strong version of “Pale” at PNC Arts Center, and received a standing ovation from the hard-to-please Tull faithful afterward.

Bad for him, but good news for us — he’ll have to keep touring.

The everyday Heavy Seas menu is not so much playing it safe as playing it smart. Diners are getting to know, and to depend on, a solid lineup of menu items that a new kitchen is able to deliver with consistent results. Seeber has also had time to fix the few things that weren't working. The menu's original braised pork belly appetizer, which was confusingly paired with a slice of crab toast, has been replaced by a tempura version, five luscious nuggets ready for dipping in a tomato-maple sauce.

The rise of foodie culture and more people trying to make better use of their space both explain why so many homeowners have embraced the benefits of a well-planned pantry.

With his relentless emphasis on pacing, Fiennes' film loses something of the classic's depth and power. Events that should unfold gradually seem to spring to life within moments.

Director James McTeigue (“V for Vendetta”) keeps the movie in motion, and as long as it’s in motion, with Cusack scrambling, delivering zingers and showing panic at what his fervid imagination has created, it works. Dread hangs over the film, which has the look of a graphic novel adaptation. There are dead spots in the narrative and dead weights in the cast (villain and cop are lacking), and the climax is anti-climactic.

Not much is known for sure about Billy the Kid: His real name was William Bonney; he was involved, on the losing side, in a vicious land war in Lincoln County, N.M., then the most violent territory in America; he killed many men and himself died in 1881, at age 21, shot by his friend Pat Garrett at Fort Sumner. These are the bare bones of the legend, but Ondaatje pries the reader's mind loose from them, bringing the climax of Billy's tale, and his psychology, to life with a shocking ferocity.

"Last night, the president was insistent to pass his bill -- and there is no bill yet -- but all or nothing hasn't worked in Washington over last eight months. Let's try a better way.

To be fair, Russia's interests in Syria and Iran do differ from America's. "Most of those in the Putin entourage think Syrian President Bashar al-Assad can tough it out and he will be extremely grateful to Russia," says Georgi Mirsky, one of Russia's leading Middle East experts. Russia sells arms to Damascus and can dock its ships in the Syrian port of Tartus, the only Mediterranean fueling station to which it has access.
That broke the silence, for me. But the real silences from Sept. 11 were hours, days or weeks away. They were the endless silences, at the birthday table with the empty seat or in the bedroom where someone left a pair of earrings she would not come home to wear.

The Walker builds relationships with certain performers in what can amount to a long courtship. Last month, Marc Bamuthi Joseph -- whose matrix of hip-hop, theater and spoken word first touched down on the Walker's stage in 2007 -- performed the interactive spectacle "red, black & GREEN: a blues." To prepare for the show, the Oakland-based performer was a Walker artist-in-residence in 2011. He toured impoverished neighborhoods and met with community leaders to research environmental justice. His art is difficult to put into a single box, Bither said, but Bither loves the challenge of giving an audience the chance to experience something they otherwise wouldn't see.

Paterno doesn’t sound like a man who didn’t know how to handle it. He sounds like one who didn’t want to handle it. He called his supervisors.

Jamison also has allowed his heir apparent to succeed in a reserve role and to gain confidence -- usually against the opponent's reserves. Thompson is an impressive weak-side defender and an explosive leaper. He also possesses good basketball acumen, rarely making poor decisions. But Thompson, another Cav who doesn't create his own shot, would be exposed as a starter. He and Irving will get to play together soon enough. Coach Byron Scott is making the smart play by sticking with Jamison.
This story has been just one more reminder that the sports world is the wrong place to look for role models - positive or negative. Lee gave up enough money to last the average person 75 lifetimes and "settled" for enough to last 60 lifetimes.

The protesters recently got a semi-boost from the U.S. Supreme Court, which said in a civil case that the group's actions were offensive but protected as free speech.

When Oregon tried to pass a helpful and compassionate buffer bill this spring, the effort died when Senate leaders got spooked about Oregon's overly generous constitution. Mourners here remain legally unprotected from in-your-face funeral protests.

Which brings us back to the current hullabaloo. It strikes me that this particular fracas is rooted in a particularly Calvinist problem, especially considering how much it has upset the evangelical world. Within Calvinist theology, there is often a strong accent toward what is called "irresistible grace," namely that God's grace and love are so amazing it is impossible to resist it. Hence, as Bell would have it, love always wins. The idea of irresistible grace becomes a difficult concept to pit against a notion of hell where people are, for whatever reason, banished away from God's grace forever. It strikes me that Bell is trying to resolve this particular tension in Calvinist theology. And the jury is still out as to whether that tension is resolvable.

Hepatitis B (HBV) is similar to HCV, and also transmitted in a similar fashion as HCV. About 1 million to 2 million people in the United States are infected with HBV. Worldwide, about 400 million people carry the virus and about 2 billion had exposure to HBV. It is very common in some parts of world, including China, East Asia and Africa. In those countries, mother passes the virus to the children (known as vertical transmission). In the United States, those who are born in those countries and whose parents are from these countries have a high prevalence of HBV. HBV is highly infectious (several times higher than HIV or HCV) and could be transmitted easily by body fluids that may contain blood.

The speculation about Hightower aside, most people I’ve spoken to still think it’s more likely that the Ravens trade back to accumulate more picks than trade up in the first round. But another team to keep an eye on is the New England Patriots, who sit at 27th and 31st in the first round.

The Green Bay Packers sit at 28 and they need a young center just like the Ravens do. The Packers signed long-time Indianapolis Colt Jeff Saturday, but he, like Matt Birk, figures to contemplate retirement again next offseason. Konz is also a Wisconsin kid and I’m sure there will be some temptation to keep him home.
