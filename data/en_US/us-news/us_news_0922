That's when I got scared. I thought, Oh my God, what have I done? Initially, we went to people who work in stores we go to and hoped they would talk to us. The first place we went to was the Chesterfield Fire Department. We had put together 30 bags of nonperishable meals: spaghetti, pasta sauce, canned fruits and canned vegetables and box of brownies in blue gift bags. They were so appreciative, and they sat for an hour a half and told us about how they help the community. It was a really positive experience.

When Dawkins became a free agent and signed with the Broncos in 2009, his news conference was held the same day incumbent quarterback Jay Cutler discovered that new coach Josh McDaniels tried to trade him.

Scouts I have spoken with are split as to whether Upshaw or Mercilus is the better prospect, but I believe Mercilus is rated more highly by most teams. It's true Upshaw had more production in 2010 than Mercilus, but Mercilus had way more production in 2011. Last season Mercilus had 7.5 more sacks and seven more forced fumbles than Upshaw. In fact, Mercilus nearly had as many sacks in 2011 as Upshaw had in his entire career (16 to 16.5), and he had three more forced fumbles. He also worked out better than Upshaw (4.68 40 yard dash to 4.76), and he has better intangibles. The Alabama program might be better than the Illinois program, but Mercilus is a better prospect in my eyes.

He always been that way, Holly said.

5.John Mica. This one is interesting. The senior Republican among Central Florida's U.S. House delegation has never before appeared in the top five. And yet he pops up now -- after his party becomes the minority in Congress. So why did our panelists deem him so powerful? Primarily because he was downright dogged in his pursuit of commuter rail -- and ultimately successful. For more than a decade, the 64-year-old from Winter Park pursued his dream, despite one roadblock (or is that track-block?) after another. One panelist suggested his autobiography be named The Little Light Rail and Congressman That Could. It's worth noting that Mica -- who seems to tick off his own constituents less often than some others in our congressional delegation -- is the only member of the U.S. House to ever make this list . . . or, really, even come close.

A 2007 UCLA study of a few Los Angeles elementary schools found that children rush to the vendors outside the gates when school lets out. But more often than not, they are accompanied by parents or caregivers who buy them items. Other adults drive up to purchase snacks, the study reported. In other words, adults are frequently deciding whether and what the children may eat, and it's not clear why the state needs to step in to micromanage such decisions. Los Angeles, by the way, already bans vendors near schools, but the ban has limited effect, according to the study, because it's seldom enforced. A new state law is unlikely to change that.

It's worth noting that in all of these pieces Franzen's style remains superb. "I was devoting a lot of energy to the morbid avoidance of colds," he writes about himself in his 20s, "because whenever I got a cold I couldn't write or smoke, and whenever I couldn't write or smoke I couldn't feel smart, and feeling smart was pretty much my only defense against the world."

It's tempting to say that good health is the ultimate factor in the National League West, as it was for the world champion Giants, last year's Arizona Diamondbacks and, perhaps, the Matt Kemp-led Dodgers this year.

I'm optimistic that news organizations like The Bee will survive and thrive, simply because they're providing the detailed reporting and analysis unavailable anywhere else. But it's been tough watching this paper and others lose so many great reporters and editors as they've cut back over the past few years. And I'm troubled by the increasing political polarization in our society, which I think is at least partly the result of fewer people reading newspapers and instead turning to alternative media outlets that just confirm their own biases.

But what to do about Syria's uprising? Let's start by putting it in historical context. What is happening in Syria, and across the Arab world today, is the first popular movement since the late 19th and early 20th century that has not been animated by foreign policy or anti-colonialism or Israel or Britain. Instead, says Paul Salem, the director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, "it is about us and our jobs and accountable government. ... It is a profound reorientation to domestic priorities and pragmatism. It is a quest for dignity," emerging from the bottom up."

Eating on the run, whether it's fast food or an energy bar, can wreak havoc with your digestion and your waistline, so be kind to yourself and follow these suggestions: Save half of your order and take it home for later. Avoid fried food; stick with grilled, baked, and steamed. Bulk up on veggies and fruits, which are high in fiber and nutrition. Choose leaner cuts of meat and smaller portion sizes. Watch out for hidden calories in condiments, dressings, sauces, and toppings. Do a little research online and know what you are putting in your mouth. A big bowl of soup for dinner is filling, and you won't eat as much high-calorie food. Instead of supersizing, get the kid size or an appetizer. Whatever you eat should make you feel good, not sick.

It was Deep Throat who helped Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein tell the Watergate story, which ended with the resignation of President Nixon. A few die-hard Nixon loyalists and others have excoriated Felt for revealing secrets, but he should be seen as courageous for aiding in the exposure of high crimes by the president and his felonious henchmen.
You may recall the problem that another popular talk show host named Don Imus had after he called a championship girls basketball team "nappy-headed hos." I do not like disparaging references made about anybody, but Mr. Imus used that reference as a description that he had often heard used in black vernacular. He thought his listeners would take it as a joke. He was catastrophically wrong. His show was shut down quickly.

Pfizer is the last major U.S. drugmaker to report its results. Like many of its peers, it missed Wall Street revenue expectations but managed to beat earnings-per-share expectations. That was the case for Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly and Co., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Abbott Laboratories. Biotechnology company Amgen Inc., which makes anemia drugs for cancer and kidney dialysis patients, bucked the trend, narrowly beating revenue expectations and handily topping EPS forecasts.

"We all recognize how much families and businesses are struggling with the current economy," DiCiccio wrote. "Those in the private sector have taken 10 to 25 percent compensation cuts . . .

Art most effectively imitated life in the adaptation of Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" -- in which Taylor and Burton played mates who fought viciously and drank heavily. She took the best actress Oscar for her performance as the venomous Martha in "Virginia Woolf" and again stole the awards show, this time by not showing up at the ceremony. She refused to thank the academy upon learning of her victory and chastised voters for not honoring Burton.

But if the bottom line is putting one's face and message in front of the largest number of people, then is the venue relevant? Candidates have dutifully made the rounds of late-night talk shows for more than a decade. Is an hour or two on "Today" that much less elevated than playing saxophone on"The Arsenio Hall Show"?

The Quivira National Wildlife Refuge in central Kansas is almost dry after a long summer. The Cheyenne Bottoms Wildlife Area, also in central Kansas, was down to two hunting pools of shallow water and low numbers of ducks when the season opened last weekend.

Curiously, Negro has appeared on the census form since 1950, Mark Memmott reported on his NPR blog, The Two-Way, and was included in the 2000 census. Why it caused a dust-up this time isn't clear. But maybe it owes to the fact that historically comparatively few blacks complete the census.

"If we'd interviewed these women one year or five years or 10 years prior to diagnosis, would these same women have reported greater levels of stress than their counterparts in the study?" he asked.

What is most rewarding for me and what I believe is most critical to student success is the connection I strive to make with each student. Unfortunately, with six classes of 35-plus students, it's nearly impossible to maintain that connection with every single student. In order to serve the needs in my Senior English class of 38, I would need to give at least five minutes of individual learning time and at best they get half of that. I can't imagine what next year holds for my colleagues and me with another multimillion dollar deficit looming.

A. I have to say that I was a little cynical at first. But then I realized that we could never do justice to the final book if we tried to do it in one movie. There was just no way. There's far too much plotline. One of the producers said they might not have been able to call it the "Deathly Hallows" because that part would have to be cut from a single movie. That would have been ridiculous. I saw that they were right to split the book.
The audit says Kinder should have disclosed his position with the Tour before voting to approve more than $2 million in funding for the race.

All of which might seem odd because Mercier doesn't make the kind of art usually associated with the French scene. He doesn't explicitly attempt to deconstruct grand theories with his work, which also includes photographs. When it comes to philosophy, he said he "would rather read about it" than see an exhibit by a conceptual artist. His sculptures don't evoke the clichés of postmodern French art, often called "intellectualisant," as one critic said. By that he meant "boring."
If prosecutors establish that Wal-Mart violated the law, the size of any fine could amount to millions of dollars, depending on the size of the competitive edge U.S. officials estimated the company gained from any illegal actions, lawyers said, estimating that a government probe could take two to four years.

Adler Peckerar's group is part of a postmodern movement that celebrates the flowering of a largely secular Yiddish culture, one that produced an astonishing outpouring of literature, music, art and science in the late 19th and early 20th centuries before being all but silenced by the one-two punch of Soviet repression and the Holocaust.

1. There are so many empty spaces on the roster, so many areas suffering from neglect, so many broken-down areas, that it's almost silly to isolate on a couple of problem spots. When your team has gone 15-65 over the last three seasons, and not had a winning record since 2003, and is just underway in another regime change, it's safe to say that there's a lot of work to do. More work, arguably, than any other NFL franchise. Yes, the Rams are facing what appears to be a severe shortage at defensive tackle. And they clearly have to replenish their supply of cornerbacks. And then there's -- always -- the offensive line.
"We're a young team. We're growing up quick, though. I think, like I said, I can't say enough about Game 2. It's given us new legs and newfound confidence. We wrestled home ice back again, which is a good sign for us."
Members of both political parties, including Cardin, say that over-classification is a problem in Washington. The 9/11 Commission named it as contributing to the government's inability to prevent the 2001 attacks, suggesting that excess classification made it more difficult for government agencies to share vital intelligence.

Bateson provides statistical evidence that suicide - especially suicide on impulse, but also planned suicides that fail - if prevented, have a statistical probability of not happening again. Suicide, in short, is preventable, and should be prevented, if at all possible by a caring society committed to a humane and effective program of preventive health care.
Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is showing signs of pulling ahead of the Democratic competition in the race to determine who faces Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker in a recall election that has become a nationally watched battle over union rights.
O'Shay's food menu includes lots of Irish options, such as corned beef tacos, Irish slingers and shepherd's pie. The fish and chips ($11.50; a "hearty Irish meal," served with a salad) were among the best I've had: four pieces of perfectly seasoned and battered fish, crispy outside and flaky inside, served with fries cooked to a just-right soggy-crispiness. (The same can be said of the fried chips, which we enjoyed immensely.)

Jim, of Warson Woods, said he was told by police, "You're not on TV and this is not CSI." His son, after leaving a St. Louis University-area bar, was found on the ground outside his car at the corner of Blair Avenue and Penrose Street. He was intoxicated and didn't remember getting there. His car had been stripped of $6,000 worth of property, including a cellphone and luggage from a recent business trip.
By the end of last week, Gov. Mark Dayton had thrown ice water over the whole idea. A local government's refusal to put any of its own money into the deal but instead rely on winnings from a racino that might or might not ever be approved, he said, is not much of a promise.
Shoppers at Hilgedick's Duck Duck Goose, a children's clothing store on Northwest 23rd Avenue, may help those predictions come true. Although traffic this year has been a tad slower, Hilgedick had to special order more of this Joan Calabrese dress made of ruffled tulle with a silk bodice. At $132, it's the most expensive dress in her shop; less pricier Easter frocks go for $40.

All wagers are purposely designed to assure the casino a specific return. This percentage return is a long-term concept and isn't based on cumulative hours of select gamblers. Your gaming time line is perhaps limited to hundreds of yanks of the handle, hands of cards or rolls of dice, not millions, so any percentage anomaly can happen.

Northwest Natural Gas Co. fourth quarter earnings beat analysts expectations, but Wall Street was disappointed by its earnings forecast for the year and sent the company's shares lower.
As an iPhone 4 owner, you should consider the 4S only if you absolutely must have the latest and greatest, or if your old phone is broken. Since the 4S is less than two years old, your carrier will probably make you pay more than the $199 base price if you upgrade, because you haven't "paid off" the subsidized price of your old phone yet.
"When he was drafted, we knew there were problems with his knees,'' Miller said. "When we talked about his extension last summer, it did come into play and into the discussions. But at the end of the day, he was the face of turning this organization and franchise around. He was Rookie of the Year, a three-time time All Star ... it just made all the sense in the world to give him the deal we gave him.

Coach Mike Brown was thrilled to have Ilgauskas back but said there was no timetable yet for his return. Ilgauskas said he'd like to return Thursday at Orlando against All-Star Dwight Howard. He also said he expected to regain his starting spot when he is ready to play.
"New month, obviously, and the weather warming up and things like that will play into hitting more home runs," Sveum said. "Would we have more than we have now if the weather was different and the wind wasn't blowing in (at Wrigley Field)? Of course we would. At the beginning, we came across a lot of good pitching, and now it's leveled off. All that comes into play."

Big win: Office. Many Android devices come with a hacked-down Office clone. The Windows Phone edition of Office is certainly limited in features and scope -- mostly: making notes, and making edits to "real" Office docs that you've ideally shared via Microsoft's SkyDrive cloud service. It's good to get a meaty editor as a built-in.
Whitmore: "Their judgement of the degree of violence (went into the decision) … they deemed it a minor penalty and that's why they called it a minor. It's their judgement. They see the whole play unfold and they didn't deem in this instance obviously that King drove (Pietrangelo) into the boards. It was a hit, he was in a vulnerable position, but they didn't deem it violent enough to call a major."
Food provides about one-quarter of a person's daily hydration needs. (Tomatoes, for example, are about 90 percent water, some meats 50 percent, and Swiss cheese 35 percent.)
Though the truffle is exciting, the beef feels obligatory - Chicago has enough steakhouses. What isn't obligatory is the beef's garnish - a parade of carrots, poached, pureed and spherified (a molecular gastronomy technique that creates something akin to a gelatin ball) and filled with mousse. The mousse is incredibly creamy, but the encapsulating half-sphere is a touch too rubbery and relatively flavorless. The garnish feels like Nugent showing off. Unless you're Bugs Bunny or have faltering vision, you never really desire that many carrot variations.
He entered Northwestern University's School of Speech in 1941 on a scholarship from the drama club. While there, he fell in love with a young speech student named Lydia Clarke.

Their union was one of the most durable in Hollywood, lasting 64 years in a town known for its highly publicized divorces, romances and remarriages.

We've had impassioned debates over covering the open reservoirs that hold our drinking water at Mount Tabor and at Washington Park, which are lovely to look at but considered unsafe by the Environmental Protection Agency.
I love this song. It's sort of a country-pop version of "I Gotta Feeling" by the Black Eyed Peas, only with much better lyrics. I have said it before and I'll say it again: it is telling that the most sincere and passionate love song on "Speak Now" is the one Swift wrote for her band. There's a moment in the second verse where Swift sings "this is absurd!," and one of her backing vocalists (playing the role of a hater, or a doubter, or just somebody bad) screams the line in a voice redolent of authority. It's very Roger Waters.

"It’s a very masculine kind of feminine desire, which I found appealing," she says, sitting in a swank Manhattan hotel room. "She doesn’t temper her desires at all.

Also consider how much time you'll spend getting your product repaired. If you believe time is money, it might be worth your while to junk your broken item rather than to spend hours finding a good repair tech, comparing estimates and living without the piece while you're waiting for service.

Perhaps still smarting from last November's election, commissioners seemed to rule out at least one option: placing a competing light rail measure before voters. In November's election, voters passed a county measure on urban renewal, but it lost out to a more popular, competing citizens' initiative, which requires a countywide vote on new urban renewal districts in unincorporated parts of the county. "In terms of putting out a competing measure (on rail), I'm not for that," Commissioner Jamie Damon said today.
