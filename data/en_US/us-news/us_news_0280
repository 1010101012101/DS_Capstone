Although the property's TripAdvisor reviews are mostly positive, one guest complained about lax housekeeping and security.

And it led to a solution that was tone-deaf architecturally: After failing to reach any common ground with the Conservancy, the district directed Gonzalez Goodale, in designing a new high school building, to match as closely as possible the size and shape of the old hotel. Other elements of the historic campus, which included contributions from Paul R.

Our oceans serve as the primary source of protein for a billion people. We use them for transport, recreation, vacation and inspiration. Microbes in the oceans make 50 percent of the oxygen we breathe, as well as omega-3 fatty acids that make their way into our food and help us stay healthy. Their waves and winds may soon help us create clean energy. And yet we load them full of trash, tolerate catastrophic oil spills and ignore the impact on them of climate change and carbon dioxide waste.

The most successful stem cell experiment so far is one that Californians might remember because it gained attention when Proposition 71 authorized the stem cell bond in 2004.

The door's also kicked open to a slew of top-notch crime fiction set in Asia proper, especially China.

øThe Explorer mode supports up to four players. You can choose to play with each player having his own controller or in "Hot-Seat," where one controller is passed around. As in the Quiz mode, you will select a character to represent you; but this time, each of the eight possible characters comes with a special ability that can be used once during the game.

Fathers and sons are a leitmotif running through "Syriana" to the point where you wonder if this mythical land shares China's bias against daughters. There are warm family scenes of Damon's hyped-up energy guru and Amanda Peet as his wife breakfasting with their young boys, a prelude to a family disaster. Jeffrey Wright as an up-and-coming lawyer smoothing the way for the oil merger reveals his character's failings in his inability to deal with his alcoholic father.

Two tables over, beneath the eye-catching orange-red neon sign spelling out bäco in fat cartoony letters, steam rises from a deep white porcelain bowl. A spoons dives in, mixes up the contents, lifting some broth, noodles, mushrooms and a bit of egg from the bowl. (I know what's in it because I ordered the bäzole after I caught the look of bliss on the eater's face.) The surprise is the crunchy bits of pork and beef carnitas bobbing in the concentrated pork-chile broth. It's a soup I can imagine Momofuku's David Chang appreciating.

The sign out front should say "Destroying Diets since 1952!" Leonard's is Honolulu's leading purveyor of malasadas, a kind of hot, airy doughnut first made by the Portuguese in the Azores.

The National Marrow Donor Program, which keeps the only registry of potential marrow donors in the United States, says it will continue its practice of not paying for stem cells. Looking at what has happened with the sale of blood and plasma makes it clear why. Sellers of plasma are 100 times more likely than donors to have — and deny — a medical condition that could potentially endanger the recipient (although plasma can be sterilized, unlike blood or stem cells). Payment for blood is legal but almost unheard of because of the greater risk. TheU.S. Food and Drug Administrationrequires paid-for blood to be labeled as such, and most hospitals will not use it.
After losing by 20 percentage points in 2004 to Republican Rep. Charlie Bass, Paul Hodes made a surprising turnaround on
A: Hey, Jason: Good question. This stems from the practice of roster-stashing in the 1980s. The Redskins, in particular, would stash young players by stretching the definition of injury and sitting them down on Injured Reserve. At the time, a player could go on IR for four weeks. The rule was changed to discourage teams from doing this. I really thought the time was right for the IR rules to revert back to a four-week layoff, but it was not changed in the new CBA.

He met his mother, asked if she was OK and the two of them returned to the parking lot. At this point, the district attorney stopped him to ask some questions. She said the witness is often using his hands to gesture and she needed more specific detail for the written record.

Question: "And you said there was blood there and you grasped at the collar of your shirt." Answer: "Yeah, it looked like a finger ... I don't know for sure it was blood.

According to the National Association for College Admissions Counseling, the number of college applicants who applied to seven or more schools has risen steadily during the last 20 years, reaching 25 percent in 2010, the most recent year available. In 2000, the number was 13 percent. In 1991 it was 8 percent.

The light bulb thing goes on the chart, though -- one more telling point on a timeline that stretches back to the 1930s, tracking the steady strangulation of individual liberty by a government driven by the unshakable belief that it knows better than we do what's best for us.

I'm not a religious person, but I have nothing but admiration for those whose own faith impels them to serve a wider community. And I'd like to hear Romney talk less about his love for Michigan's perfectly proportioned trees and more about the way his religious experience has shaped his views about human nature, government and what it means to lead a successful life.

The Venetian’s new Public House gastropub, from the same team behind Holstein’s at the Cosmopolitan and the Barrymore at the Royal House, is serious about beer. There are more than 200 selections, including two dozen on tap. And the cocktail list isn’t bad either. But executive chef Anthony Meidenbauer’s skillful elevation of bar food is the main reason you should go. This is a tavern that serves veal sweetbreads with parsnip puree and green apple slaw as a starter. That dish and the crispy oysters with foie gras are two great examples of a chef understanding the importance of texture. And the branzino meuniere, in all its brown-buttery glory, is the kind of hearty fish dish that will satisfy even the most voracious meat eaters. Another solid new spot is KJ Dim Sum & Seafood at the Rio, which you can expect to be mobbed during this summer’s World Series of Poker. The pan-fried noodles and shrimp dumplings are as good as what you’ll find in Vegas’ Chinatown on Spring Mountain Road — not surprising, given that this restaurant is from the same team behind Chinatown’s always popular KJ Kitchen.

Let me describe the #3 plate at every local authentic Mexican restaurant 50 years ago. Imagine an oval, particularly thick ceramic plate being hustled over straight out of an oven, so hot it can only be delivered with a potholder and a warning to never, ever touch—it's a hot, hot plate each recipient, individually, will be told—that is set down a distance from the edge of the table so it won't burn chest hairs or whatever, and the clothes in between. The refried beans are gurgling, and the "Spanish" rice is reconstituting into its dry grain state, the peas and carrot chunks mutating away from the vegetable category, and the red sauce of the enchiladas is bubbling, the yellow and white cheese topping still sizzling from being on the verge of burning. Wait long enough so the plate can be handled. Then, go on, tip it sideways. Tip it upside down. Toss it to practice dexterity, letting it roll over and over, and catch it. Spin it on a finger like a top, food side down, or roll it on its edge across a long banquet table. Yes, the tablespoon of shredded iceberg lettuce and that thin, very thin slice of a too-green red tomato—colorful garnish—that nobody ever eats anyway, both of them wilted and dehydrated, will fall off. But the rest? Nope. It's a Mexican Frisbee!

He finally agreed this year to one night, in a cottage at Yogi Bear's Jellystone Park Resort next to Six Flags in Eureka. We'd enjoy the campground during the day, stay the night and head out to Six Flags the next morning. To be honest, the air-conditioned cottage was hardly camping, but it was perfect for my husband's introduction. The cozy manufactured home has a living room with futon and satellite TV, a kitchen area, a bathroom, a small bedroom (more like a closet) with bunk beds and a bedroom with a queen bed. The place is full of windows, has a large porch, a grill and a fire pit, where we roasted marshmallows (a store on site has all the fixin's). We spent the night using our StarWalk app on the iPad to look at and identify the constellations on a clear night.

Last November Republicans won the House and landslide gains in many states in large part because of the deep unpopularity of the stimulus and ObamaCare. Mr. Boehner has a mandate for spending cuts and repealing the Affordable Care Act.

Chef Kevin Willmann, who had built a loyal following at Erato in Edwardsville, crosses the river to open his own place off the beaten path in a sparsely appointed space near the Jamieson Avenue exit on Interstate 44. Using primarily local ingredients, he constructs clever, intricate flavor combinations, such as a dish deceptively named "nachos" but made with sweet potato chips, artisan bacon and blue cheese. He departs from locavore purism with a regular selection of ocean seafood dishes, which is a great benefit given his deft hand with fish.

Along the way, Fey shares a few moments of self-revelation -- only to quickly step behind a privacy screen and reassert control. Take that scar on her face, for example. Fey briefly tells how she got it: "during the spring semester of kindergarten, I was slashed in the face by a stranger in the alley behind my house." That bare detail sounds plenty alarming. But Fey only brings it up "to explain why I'm not going to talk about it," then veers into a shrewdly observed riff on how she can read people based on how they react to her scar.

When I went to swim laps today, I spoke with the manager. He graciously let me pay the reduced amount of a one-day “early bird” special held last Dec. 4, when I thought I had gone to pay for my summer membership. I remember seeing the blue card in the car and reminding myself not to forget, but I must have forgotten. Maybe the line was too long. Maybe I realized I’d left my wallet at home, something which happened more than once that month. Maybe I turned around in the parking lot and decided to go to Blakehurst first. That Saturday I remember sitting in Harriett's kitchen at mid-day, calling people she wanted to know of her illness.

Find a safe spot. Upon arrival, walk around the airport to scout out the right spot to spend the night. Look for other airport sleepers, as you may want some company or someone to watch your back. Look for an area that balances security (surveillance cameras, good lighting) with comfort (soft chairs, minimal noise).

During a behind-the-scenes preview about a week ago, I walked through the Transformers attraction with the lights on and the ride vehicles off. At the time, I was impressed by the thematic layers of set dressing and props I found throughout the ride. But much of that military bunker motif was lost when I climbed aboard the ride for the first time and seemingly raced through the attraction in the dark. Like an ornate proscenium framing a theater's stage, much of the detail disappeared when the lights went down and my eyes zoomed in on the movie screens.

A. The wild card, and least conclusive outcome in the case, probably also is the least likely, based on what justices said during the arguments. No justice seemed inclined to take this path, which involves the court's consideration of a technical issue.

The appeals court said it was bound by the federal Anti-Injunction Act, which is intended to facilitate tax collections and keep the government operating. That law says federal courts may not hear challenges to taxes, or anything that looks like a tax, until after they are paid.
