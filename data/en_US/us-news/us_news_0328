"For our 30-year anniversary last year, we put an image of a protester on the cover of our album, 'The Dissent of Man,'" said Greg Graffin, lead singer for SoCalpunk group Bad Religion ("It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"). "Our hope in doing that was, yes, to spark and celebrate the idea of protest in music. Whether or not it catches steam, it's very hard to say. But one thing we've seen in cities across America is young people showing they stand for each other. If we can help inspire that with music, it's a job well done."
"Good old Facebook, that's how it got started," Buck said. A designer saw the page and made a website for the cause, www.loveforlana.org.
Questions have arisen about how he financed his campaign. When reporters asked about his finances at a news conference, he tried to have them removed from the room.

Eliezer is a single-minded archivist who wears giant headphones to block out the world. The title of the movie refers to his proudest achievement, a long-ago mention in the fine print of his mentor's opus. Yet befitting a fable, after Uriel sneaks a soft cushion beneath this ivory tower, the dogged researcher finds a bittersweet bone.

Boonton Mayor Cyril Wekilsky was happily stunned by how quickly the repairs were made.
In any case, Zellers said he and Senjem decided to go ahead with action on the tax and bonding bills and schedule the stadium vote - but he made it clear Dayton is on his own in rounding up the votes.

Before the boom, the region's affordability rating was already considered high at 115 percent. Now, the rating is a record 163, because of lower home prices and interest rates, but that's still not enough to draw many buyers.
The Baltimore Greenbelt, as I would define it, is tangent to all six jurisdictions of the Baltimore region. It begins with two stream valley or greenway state park bookends — the 18,000-acre Gunpowder State Park on the Baltimore County/Harford County border on the east; and the 16,000-acre Patapsco Valley State Park bordered by Baltimore, Carroll and Howard counties on the west. These two heavily wooded parks provide outstanding scenic, environmental and recreational resources. These parks, conceived more than 60 years ago, began to expand greatly as funding become available for park acquisition under the state's Program Open Space, enacted in 1969.
“I couldn’t tell you that right now,” Smith said. “We have our options with him, we’ll see how it all shakes out, but Chris of course can do both. Right now, we’ve been two weeks into our off-season program. Let us get into it a little bit more and we’ll be able to define some roles a little bit better then.”

Some saw AT&T's new policy as more transparent and generous than its previous policy, under which it slowed Internet use for the top 5% of unlimited data users in individual markets. That vague limit often resulted in users seeing their Web-surfing slowed after they had only used around two gigabytes of data.
Endangered monk seals also occasionally haul out on the populous beach — a good opportunity to teach kids to stay at least 150 feet away, even if they see curious adults breaking the law. Reward them with a trip to the nearby Brennecke's Beachside Deli, which carries shave ice, cold drinks, sandwiches and convenience store items.

The tour is one goal of a two-year, $5.5 million fundraising campaign that University Circle Inc. launched recently. The other $3.5 million would go toward the community development organization's endowment to help pay for maintenance of public spaces. The Kent H.

The Pirates had a 10-point lead with under six minutes to play and let the Bulls steal the victory and the thunder. Kevin Willard and Jordan Theodore both go back to this as the turning point in the season, which would eventually sidetracke Seton Hall from going to the NCAAs, while sending South Florida on the path toward March. The missed 1-and-1 by Theodore was the final nail, but not holding onto a led against an anemic offense like USF's is a major no-no.
"If there is a drop, people don't feel it in the buildings," Jerry Jordan, president of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, said last summer.

The Sugar Bowl also has the first selection of at-large teams, after the Rose Bowl would replace Oregon, but Ohio State can't be picked by the Rose Bowl in that spot. So if the Sugar has a choice between TCU, Ohio State or Michigan State -- the only non-SEC at-larges that may be available in our scenario -- that's not a difficult choice in terms of fans and TV ratings, and the on-field product isn't much to argue with either.
One fire currently burning in Tabernacle and Woodland townships in the heart of the Pinelands has extended to approximately 1,000 acres. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service and Burlington County firefighters said about 4 p.m. the blaze was 50 percent contained.

That said, the "stumbles and shuts off" description of your restart attempts may be a clue. The "stumble" means its got spark and some fuel. Installing a fuel pressure gauge and test driving the car until it stalls would tell you if a lack of fuel pressure is the problem. If so, try a couple of simple fixes. Carry a gallon of water in the car. and when it stalls for lack of fuel pressure, pour the water slowly over the fuel rail, pressure regulator and intake manifold to cool them. If the engine restarts and runs, it could be vapor lock -- fuel boiling in the fuel rail causing a loss of fuel pressure. And even though you've replaced the catalytic converter, make sure there is no exhaust restriction that could lead to an overheated manifold and cylinder head.

A: BlackBerry phones are especially good for email and not only handle texts well, but have their own free BlackBerry-to-BlackBerry messaging service. They also come with excellent physical keyboards, which some users strongly prefer.

Yes, these lovers have their own flaws. But ultimately it’s a cruel society that dooms them — just as small-town hypocrisies scar the teenage lovers of "Splendor in the Grass" (driven to ruin and madness by sexual repression) or clannish prejudices erupt in violence in "West Side Story" (and punctuate that romance in death).

The problem is that students, especially poor ones, often can't afford to pay the fines. Indeed, some choose to avoid school altogether rather than risk being cited for showing up late.

That's hardly a success story.

* The new NFL kickoff rules are absurdly bad. The other new rule requiring all scoring plays to be reviewed is equally inane. To clarify, a play has to be called a touchdown (or safety, etc.) on the field for it to be automatically reviewed. The reason Shurmur had to challenge Evan Moore's play in the end zone was because it was ruled "no catch" by the official on the field. Yet Moore's first touchdown -- which had no controversy whatsoever -- was revewed for almost 2 minutes. Dumb, dumb, dumb.

Perhaps this is why Josephine's face and name are absent from most of the island's narrow streets, colorful buildings and even the Pagerie's gift shop, which mostly features postcards of island scenes. And there's nothing subtle about the condition of the statue of Josephine in the main square in Fort-de-France, where the intimidating stone fort still looms over cruise ships and ferries in the harbor.

5. "Damages" (DirecTV): With the move from FX to DirecTV for the mystery drama's fourth season, there was significantly less buzz surrounding this marvelously sly show. Too bad.

øThe constant battling of others makes this game more attractive to little boys than girls; and yet the slow pace, the bucolic settings and ability to befriend others by doing them favors will appeal to girls. As such, PokePark 2 is a weird mix of play patterns. But given that the fighting is a constant, parents looking for games with no violence should steer away from this one.
U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry drew the current boundaries after the last redistricting commission deadlocked in late December of 2001.

"Housing market challenges continue to serve as a drag on manufacturing growth in a number of ways, both direct and indirect. First and foremost, housing starts are down from 2.1 million homes being built per year a few years ago to around 600,000 today," said Chad Moutray, the chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. "That means less demand for building materials for construction, and appliances and furniture for furnishings. But it also means that we have that many fewer people employed in the construction sector _ all potential customers for manufactured goods."

He comes from a blue state. Candidates who come from states where their party is in the minority are much more likely to be elected. In government, it really helps to have a feel for how people in the other party think. Neither President Obama nor George W. Bush had this.

Finally, under Obama, the international terrorism dangers have been reduced, particularly with the assassination of Osama bin Laden, and hundreds of his allies. Sadly, and unfortunately, candidate Romney talks as if he would repeat these Bush-like adventures. Romney says he wants to build a military so strong that no country would dare threaten the U.S. This is the same sort of George W. Bush braggadocio that started the national economy into a downward spiral from which there has yet been no recovery.
The discussion made me realize how many years had passed since I tasted a Mouton Cadet wine. I had just spotted the 2010 Bordeaux blanc for $8.99 in the French section at Trader Joe's in Brentwood, and I thought it would be fun to compare it to a white Bordeaux that cost a few dollars more. I chose another popular Bordeaux blanc, the 2010 Château Ducasse, which I found for $13.99 at the Wine and Cheese Place in Clayton. The Château Ducasse is imported by Kermit Lynch Wine Merchant, respected for its French and Italian selections.

Here we go again. Another young mother kills her baby. It's a shame. If she didn't want the baby, she could have given it up for adoption. I'm sure there's a lot of women out there who can't have kids but would love to have one. The kid would still be alive and living in a nice house, probably, with a good family. I don't know what was worse: finding out the kid was dead or listening to the news media. They're like vultures competing with each other to see who comes out with the best news story. You guys ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

As a tax-paying American citizen, I am outraged that my tax dollars are supporting the slaughter of wildlife I fight so hard to protect. Shame on you, Wildlife "Services!

The National Institutes of Health strongly advises average Americans younger than 50 to reduce their sodium consumption to 2,300 milligrams, or no more than a teaspoon a day. It all adds up pretty fast, so unsalted pretzels can be a good option, as long as you keep in mind that they are not actually sodium-free. Instead, products labeled unsalted whittle the sodium content down to 75 to 100 milligrams per serving.
China holds the high ground given the altitude of the Tibet plateau — key in any land conflict — in part because of its superior hardware and better rail and road links. By some estimates, China could deploy troops within a week, whereas India would need three weeks.

Samuels, averaging 4.3 points and 2.8 rebounds, was told point blank by coach Byron Scott recently he’s running out of chances. It’s been one thing after another for the power forward. It was so nice to chat with him Sunday night and not broach the following topics: His passport, his conditioning level, his diminished role. Samuels has shown on occasion he can be an effective backup. Scott praised his effort after the game and it was well deserved. Samuels provided quality minutes with Jamison in foul trouble and also was part of the 12-0 run.

The danger is clear: As Limbaugh and others continue to push hate, we are turning the rift between Americans into a fault line. And all Americans will be hurt by it.
The food is still very good, but it's lost some of the subtle touches that made it stand out. One problem, at least on my Update visit, is that the kitchen doesn't seem to be using salt. Every dish needed a hearty sprinkle, from the otherwise delicious arugula salad with persimmon, apple and Parmesan ($9) to the orecchiette pasta that serves as a bed for nicely seared scallops ($16.50).

The CSO patrons skipped Brescia, instead traveling directly from Naples to Ravenna. What they missed was a low-key European city with a charming center lacking obvious photo opportunities (the place appears to be low on big cathedrals and monuments) and another beautiful old hall, though the Teatro Grande, with its capacity of fewer than 1,000, was the least grande venue of the tour.

On a scale of 1-10, Blues defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk said that in terms of a must-win game tonight is "a 10 for us. They would probably say the same thing in their locker room, but we have to win this game. We don't want to fall two games back, especially at home ... going to LA with that big of a hole. For us, it's definitely a must-win, just like in the first series and we've got to come out and prove it."
