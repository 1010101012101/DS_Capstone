Simple measures such as waist circumference, hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratios have gained new adherents as criticism of the BMI has mounted. At the University of Alabama, researchers are set to explore whether a computer program can analyze a series of photographs of a patient and, based on known patterns of fat deposition and musculature, recognize dangerous fat better than the BMI alone.
The changes in Mexico - and the growth of a Mexican middle class that loves to shop in the United States - shows the folly of continuing to act as though the realities along the border remain what they were in the 1990s.
An additional $17 million in the governor's budget would fund growth in the adoption program and pay subsidies to adoptive families at the current rate. Under federal law, a cut in the adoption subsidy would require an equivalent cut in the rates paid to foster families.

After Romney easily won five primaries on April 24, he gave his victory speech in New Hampshire, which held its primary months ago.
If you're not fooled by TV commercials equating chips, burgers and sugar-sweet toaster treats with pure joy, you're on the path to true happiness. In fact, you can cut your risk of depression in half by avoiding saturated fat (butter, meat, full-fat cheese) and trans fat (the Frankenfood still lurking in many munchies), and instead going for the good fats (think olive and canola oils, walnuts, avocados).

By late 1971, the group had forged a new style that sounded nothing like Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac. American vocalist-guitarist-songwriter Bob Welch had joined the group by that time, replacing Spencer. Welch's influence was dramatic, pulling the band even further toward mainstream pop and rock in strong albums such as "Future Games," 1972's "Bare Trees," 1973's "Penguin" and 1974's "Heroes Are Hard to Find."

Extra pay opportunities are available at most schools, but high schools offer the lion's share. For example, a high school teacher could earn an extra 10 percent in pay for serving as department chairman. Coaching a sports team can add $2,000 to $10,000 to a salary. Summer school can add $6,000, and teaching an extra class will bring a 20 percent boost in several districts.
As auxiliary bishop, Sheltz is second to DiNardo, handling the chancery's day-to-day business and representing the cardinal when necessary. Serving 1.2 million Catholics across 10 counties, the archdiocese here is the largest in the state and 12th-biggest in the nation, and one of the few that is adding to its ranks.
Last May, at a legislative hearing on autism, DHS supervisor Gary Cox tried to explain the apparent contradictions. As a rule, he said, Medicaid doesn't pay for "bundles of services" like ABA, but it does pay for some components, such as skills training. He used a sports analogy to elaborate.

Then there's Charlie, who is such an "evolved" male it's no wonder Marnie is bored with the relationship. He shows more passion holding his hand out so Marnie can give him her retainer than he displays when he's in bed with her. And let's not forget Elijah (Andrew Rannells), Hannah's college boyfriend who stuns her with some personal news of his own when she reconnects with him to let him know she has an STD. Elijah is now gay, he announces.

San Bruno pointed out that the engineer who wrote the section of the report on the sewer project, Robert Nickell, backed away from his own conclusions last month after newly revealed PG&E documents showed that pressure changes were far greater in recent decades than he had believed. Such changes could have weakened a seam weld on the San Bruno pipeline that ruptured Sept. 9, Nickell said in an interview with The Chronicle.

Don't misunderstand: The backcourt was a disaster defensively. Evan Turner, Jrue Holiday and Lou Williams combined for 65 points. But what happened in Game 2 can't be written off as Rose not being on the floor.
In a statement, U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) blasted the governor’s decision:
I'm inclined to agree, but not just because the usual closely watched indicators like employment, GDP, household employment and income growth are generally looking healthier these days. I'm swayed by the fact that builder confidence has risen by more than a third year over year (even though it slipped a bit in April from the month before). While builders tend to be an optimistic lot—otherwise, they wouldn't be in a business that requires them to make large capital outlays for land, labor and materials months or even years before a potential payoff—this uptick is significant.

So far, some life-changing dishes have survived. I always order yam samun phrai, a nutty northern Thai salad shrouded with sawtooth, betel, basil and lime leaves, all cut as thin as needles. It's grassy, soapy, spicy, crunchy, complex, supremely refreshing and unlike anything I've ever eaten. A new favorite is yam wun sen, zinged-out glass noodles full of teeny pork lumps, Chinese celery perfume and wide cross-sections of pickled garlic sliced right off the head --a dish so flavor-intensive it makes your entire body buzz.

Heading into the 2012 NFL Draft there is no question that Houston is favored to repeat as division champs. In fact, a case could be made that the Texans have a better chance to win the AFC South than any other NFL team has of winning their division. The Titans appear to be the only team that could pose a challenge to Houston, while Jacksonville and Indianapolis are just longing to be taken seriously again. So who might these teams select in the draft? Let's take a look:

As if to highlight this, another section of the app compares passages from the original scroll manuscript with the finished book, highlighting just those sections (detailing drug use or graphic sexuality) that had to be scaled back. The result is a three-dimensional look at the novel as a function of process — not just its author's process but also the process by which the book was edited and brought out.
Los Angeles County coroner's assistant chief Ed Winter said there were bottles of prescription medicine in the room. He would not give details except to say: "There weren't a lot of prescription bottles. You probably have just as many prescription bottles in your medicine cabinet."
The long line of recent muckraking documentaries that has preceded "Why We Fight" does nothing to diminish its force. Nor does the time elapsed since its debut at last year's Sundance Film Festival, where it won a grand jury documentary prize, for the last 12 months have been full of revelations that generally add to the film's persuasiveness. Jarecki's well-argued, if demoralizing, documentary is a thoughtful discussion of current U.S. foreign policy and lessons not learned. It may not be the words of Eisenhower nor Washington that are needed now but rather a reversal of what historian Chalmers Johnson bemoans as a lack of the "eternal vigilance" that Thomas Jefferson said was the price of freedom.
The dip in compensation came even as Wal-Mart reversed a more than two-year sales slump in its namesake business as it emphasized low prices across the store and restored thousands of items that it had culled during its campaign three years ago to declutter its stores.

Orlando Bloom is Balian, a French blacksmith who's lost his faith since losing his beloved wife and infant son. The Lord, however, works in mysterious ways. The father Balian never knew, Godfrey of Ibelin, (Liam Neeson), a knight of great renown and even greater swordsmanship, has returned briefly to France from the east. He sees great things in his illegitimate son, perhaps because of the legend engraved on one of the beams of the smithy: "What man is a man who does not make the world better?" Initially, Balian is none too sure that father knows best, and declines the offer to join the Crusades; subsequent events make him decide that getting out of town isn't the worst idea in the known world. But can he measure up? Can he truly be the parfit gentil knight of Godfrey's yearning? Even if it means risking the loss of the woman he grows to love? Ibelin lays it right on the line: "My son: You are all that survives me. Don't disappoint me."

Most of my nicknames are not printable. I have never had a bad experience in Vancouver, and although there is a rivalry, it is civil, they have great supporters and I have always felt welcome.

Helm and his bandmates  Canadians Rick Danko, Garth Hudson, Robbie Robertson and Richard Manuel  were musical virtuosos who returned to the roots of American music in the late 1960s as other rockers veered into psychedelia, heavy metal and jams. The group's 1968 debut, Music From the Big Pink, and its follow-up, The Band, remain landmark albums of the era, and songs such as The Weight, Dixie Down and Cripple Creek have become rock standards.
Instead, the slow-starting Timbers allowed a goal just 58 seconds into game and a second one 13 minutes later. Just like that, they were staring a two-goal deficit on the road against the league's stingiest defense. The Timbers' confidence fizzled and they limped back to Portland after a thorough beatdown.

There is nothing in his fashion sense—rumpled tweed jacket and jeans—to suggest his significance on the world stage of design, either. His whole demeanor is understated, as though he wished he could remain quietly anonymous. It is something of a wonder that Florence is now part of the Portobello Dock landscape; for years Dixon refused to say a thing about his home life. It goes without saying that he doesn't much enjoy the spotlight of an interview, but he is generous with his time when you do pin him down. The fact is, he is someone who would much prefer to be doing than talking.

PG&E's own rules, however, would not trigger inspections unless the pressure on the lines spiked to more than 10 percent above the five-year maximum levels.

The judge had increased the bail in response to Bianchi's concern that Fajardo-Santos had posted the lower bail and now was to be turned over to the custody of the federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement on a detainer. Bianchi feared that Fajardo-Santos, while in ICE custody, would consent to deportation and be sent back to Honduras -- essentially avoiding prosecution on the sex-assault charges.

It also comes as the Oregon Department of Forestry is moving to increase logging in the Tillamook and Clatsop state forests. In June 2009, the state board of forestry approved a management plan for the two forests that would increase logging by an estimated 20 percent.

He's playing a coverage where he knew the weakness of that coverage was going to be inside and he made them throw into the strength of the coverage.

When an information junkie gets sick, he wants to know all about it. Lake tells a story about a friend of his mother's who got colon cancer and had it spread to his liver. The diagnosis came later than Lake's, and the man's reaction was to go home and watch TV. He died less than three months after diagnosis, and Lake swears part of the reason was he didn't focus, "not in a power of positive thinking inspirational way but in a way that you absolutely have to be if you're that kind of sick."

South of Los Angeles and north of San Diego lies an intermittently magical 789-square-mile realm where freeways hum and Disneyland flourishes, where immigrants remake old communities as new ones ripple across the hills. Many outsiders treat this place as they would a prosperous but hopelessly dull relative -- the way some Europeans treat Belgium. Let's remember, people, that Belgium has given us centuries of good waffles, beer and chocolate, not to mention the French fry and Jean-Claude Van Damme. So it is, sort of, with O.C.

The teams have played four times, but none of the contests are relevant to Saturday's game. The last time the teams met was on Sept. 20, 1986.

3. The Tigers will be in every game this season thanks to the middle of their lineup. Think of it as the ultimate eraser. Raburn may rise and fall. Austin Jacksons torrid start probably wont last through the entire season (although it is awfully encouraging). But the Tigers will be able to do what they did Sunday in every game they play this season. You could almost see the ninth inning unfolding with every pitch. Everyone (including Boston pitcher Alfredo Aceves) was aware Miguel Cabrera and Prince Fielder were lurking in the dugout. Home runs, especially game-changing home runs can never be relied upon. But Sunday, it almost seemed expected when Cabrera went deep. I was mildly surprised that Fielder didnt follow suit and win it right there in the ninth inning. Thats the 2012 Tigers and thats not going away barring injury.

We’ll reserve judgment one more week on the Chargers’ awakening — until we see how Rivers fares against Terrell Suggs (three sacks, two forced fumbles today) and the Baltimore Ravens.

Another convenience food that wasn't so easy to prepare is the frozen pumpkin pie. It needs 75 minutes in a 400-degree oven. Basically, you'll need to make the frozen pie a day ahead, just like homemade. However, the taste was terrific - just as good as the recipe from the pumpkin can.

There are many country-folk revivalists in New Jersey, but few as reliably entertaining as Hoboken’s Demolition String Band. Singers Elena Skye and Boo Reiners and their accompanists are traditionalists, and their appreciation of old-time bluegrass is absolutely sincere — there’s nothing staid about their delivery, which has the swing of Ricky Skaggs and the comfort of Jerry Garcia’s Old and in the Way. These city slickers sing and play like a congenial aunt and uncle in a West Virginia mining town. They’re also terrific guitarists, and the album is framed by instrumentals: Different versions of Skye’s weeping “Jethro’s Lullabye” open and close the set, and Reiners’ “Boojo Breakdown” burns like a shot of bourbon. As usual, the pair has come up with inspired covers: Their take on the Ramones’ “Questioningly” refashions the ballad as a backwoods ramble, and “Alibis” honors the memory and roughneck approach of Blaze Foley. As you might expect from an album so resolutely Appalachian, the financial crisis casts a shadow over the songs; outstanding originals “Misfortune” and “Under the Weather” sound more desperate than the Woody Guthrie cover (“Hard Ain’t it Hard”).

Minuses: The grilled salad tasted greasy; strange wine list. Depending where you sit, noise can be distracting.
"I hope he didn't leave it out there," said coach Nate McMillan, laughing, after the game. "He's been playing that way in training camp. You didn't see a lot of that in Utah and it may be the style of play. But he's been doing that. He's been handling the ball, he's been running the breaks. He does a good job of moving without the ball and he's knocking down his shot. I want him to be aggressive."

Our wedding is already a bit unconventional, and part of me feels a cake — and the cake cutting — would bring some structure and tradition to the evening. I have no idea how this part of the ceremony began, but it's a crowd pleaser, and I'm not one to deny the masses their sugar fix. I've considered buying a small cake just to cut, but also having an array of alternative desserts (and cheese) set out. Cupcakes seem to be a popular alternative right now, but then we'd have tons of tiny cakes instead of just one big one.
"Also, the hotels of Orlando, and their role in the city's culture and commerce throughout history, are interesting. Early ones include the San Juan, the Angebilt, the Summerlin and the Fort Gatlin; they were followed by the tourist hotels and motels, such as the Wigwam Village on Orange Blossom Trail, and the early modern hotels that marked Orlando as an international tourist destination, such as the Contemporary Resort at Walt Disney World.

Things started to go very wrong on the island. Among the problems: Too many trees had been cut down. Without trees, there was no wood. Without wood, there was no way to build canoes to leave the island when the food sources began to grow scarce. Some scholars suggest that widespread starvation contributed to infertility. The population dwindled. And dwindled. And then the white man arrived, along with smallpox, indentured servitude, etc, etc, etc. This is a gross oversimplification, but you get the basic idea: Few babies were being born anymore. Soon, hardly anyone remained.

Cypress is America's textbook example of strategic golf. Nearly every tee shot presents the player with a choice. He can drive over a fearsome hazard - a dune, bunker or tree - and set up an easy shot to the green. Or, he can play safely away and make the hole infinitely longer and more difficult.

Since the food is based on McDonald's family recipes, the new location, like the original, is sure to have a mural that pays homage to her grandmother, Ruth Goree Hartwell.

One expert says the history behind the Buena Vista-San Fernando crossing reveals a glaring flaw in the mind-set of Metrolink leaders: Because they have focused more on building ridership than on improving safety, even hazards that could have been eliminated or sharply reduced have been allowed to remain. Only after the horrific Chatsworth crash did Metrolink upgrade the status of its safety unit so that it reported directly to chief executive David R. Solow.

Hensley's comment: If the Browns take running back Trent Richardson and a wide receiver with their first round picks, the decision will be to either take Weeden or an offensive tackle like Mississippi's Bobby Massie.

They are not dissimilar, however, in one telling aspect: delay. It took a ruinous riot and a new federal trial for Rodney King to receive anything approaching justice.

Ultimate cowboy: Thoroughly restored two years ago in keeping with its Old West character, Holman Ranch was part of the original Mission San Carlos Borromeo del Río Carmelo. When Mexico parceled out mission lands in the 1830s, it granted Los Laureles Rancho to Don Jose Manuel Boronda, one of Carmel Valley's first ranchers. Present-day Holman Ranch is one of 11 subdivisions created in 1928; the classic Spanish-style hacienda was built the following year with local Carmel stone and handmade Mexican terra-cotta tile. The Holman family turned it into the center of Carmel Valley social life during their tenure from the 1940s to 1981.
If the application is approved, Missouri will move toward one accountability system. Right now, districts are held to No Child Left Behind benchmarks, as well as measures in the state's annual performance report.

That has happened with the Parkway School District, for example.

 Why watch? If the Raiders win and Denver loses at home to Kansas City, Oakland wins the AFC West. If Denver wins, the Raiders can get into the playoffs as a wild card by winning, having Cincinnati lose at home to Baltimore and hope either the New York Jets win at Miami or Tennessee loses at Houston. If the Raiders lose, their season is over.

"A march is wonderful for morale," he told me. "It's a tool for mobilizing a community, for energizing people, but ultimately the hard work is what we do all summer long. We will be focusing on voter registration. That is the real struggle and the real work. I look at this as our 'freedom summer.' We are asking volunteers from all over the country to come here and help with registration. A march makes noise and lets people know that we are out there.

A: Try Amdro or Terro instead of a spray. With a problem this bad, it is going to take a fair amount of product. I've never worked with Terro, but once Amdro gets wet, it is no longer effective so Amdro needs to be applied to a dry lawn. Both products work by attracting the ants, which then carry it back to the nest, so initially it will appear as if there are even more ants. It also sounds as if this will be an ongoing process, where you will need to apply product on a periodic basis, once the current colonies are under control.
Gardeners dying to dig in have more than pansies to choose from. Due to the mild weather, Gertens, for example, plans to offer flats of dianthus, alyssum, snapdragons and other frost-hardy annuals for sale starting April 13, several weeks earlier than a typical spring.

Van Valkenburg said his office prosecutes sexual assault allegations when there is enough evidence to do so, but when there isn't, it doesn't. Nobody's rights have been violated, and the federal investigation could set a dangerous precedent of federal prosecutors second-guessing local prosecutors' work, he said.

Cameron was pleased with what general manager Ozzie Newsome had done at that point. He liked the selection of Pierce, though he said that the team is still high on Anthony Allen and Damien Berry. As Cameron said, “we’ve now got three really good young backs” in addition to Pro Bowl back Ray Rice. And he believes the versatile Osemele and Gradkowski will be in the mix for playing time right away.

"I think they can sit back right now," said a rival American League executive who requested anonymity because he cannot comment on another club's finances, "because on paper they have a very strong team. But do I think the Yankees won't spend aggressively if they start to dip in the win column? Not a chance. I think they'll do what they have to do to win."

Our first view of Machu Picchu was from across a cloud-covered valley. My daughter Betsy and I had hiked three hours in air so thick that you could cut it with a machete. We were exploring the partially restored Inca ruins of Llactapata with our companions on a seven-day trek to Machu Picchu via the less traveled Salkantay Route. Just as we reached the ruins, the mist lifted and afforded us a magical view of the mystical Inca city. It was the high point in a trip full of spectacular vistas, all-terrain hiking, high-carbohydrate food and spirited companionship.
This effort is not about large states vs. small states, as Ben fears. As California Republican Greg Aghazarian points out, both large and small states are ignored under the current system: "Issues which are vital to states like Montana and California are routinely disregarded. Issues which are vital to states like Ohio and Pennsylvania are overemphasized."

That temper fueled an especially public feud with C. Michael Greene, the former chief of the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences and the guiding hand behind the Grammys. The Grammys thundered past the American Music Awards in ratings during Greene's tenure, and one of his tactics was spreading the word that any artist who performed on the AMAs would be banned from the Grammys. Clark responded with public rage and a lawsuit. Clark dropped the suit when Greene left the academy post in 2002 after a successful but tumultuous 13-year reign.

By the way, the wraps on the walls inside and outside the stadium will feature both Ducks and Bruins. You know, so UCLA feels more at home. An
Case for: Best defensive back in the draft. Product of perennial power Louisiana State. Excellent hands. Ball hawk. Seemingly always in balance. Browns could use an upgrade at cornerback opposite Joe Haden. Recent wrist surgery won't be a problem for a corner.
The Dutch economy is performing poorly and is expected to shrink this year, expanding its budget deficit and making it one of the worst performing in the euro zone.
When playtime is over, it's time for the confinement phase of this program. For this, I use a collapsible wire crate. Available at all pet supply stores as well as online, the best ones are priced from the mid- to high-end of the range. A bargain-priced crate may not be sturdy enough to contain your dog.
Obikà has the sleek contemporary looks of a caffè in any big Italian city — except where the brioche and pastries would usually be displayed at the bar, balls of bufala mozzarella bob in their milky liquid. Bufala, smoked mozzarella and burrata and lovely fresh ricotta are flown in from Italy three times a week. By the time you order, the cheeses are, on average, 48 hours old. That's fresh for us, though it would not necessarily seem so to Neapolitans or to residents of the Campania region.

The deal: The six members of Team Christina and Team Blake all performed live last night — 12 performances total — and America had a 12-hour window in which to vote for their favorite contestants. The audience votes save three members on each team but — SURPRISE TWIST! — the coaches can save one contestant who placed in the bottom three, meaning four members from each team progress to the quarterfinals. Now, how can the lowest vote-getters convince their coaches to keep them in the competition? Oh, by singing even more, of course.
Enthusiasm for the potential of alcohol-detection technology is reflected in a proposed federal transportation bill. In it is a measure that would give the NHTSA's alcohol-detector program $24 million over two years—a sum that could allow the agency by 2013 to equip a fleet of 100 or more cars with prototypes of two types of alcohol detectors. One would measure the alcohol in the driver's breath. The other would use touch technology to take a reading from the driver's skin, likely the fingertip used to activate a starter button.
Hi Mike, as the Broncos continue to rebuild their team with an emphasis on the draft, one thing I have noticed is that they seem focused on the defensive back and defensive tackle positions. This is different from last year, when the strategy was to get the 'best available player.' Why the change? The best teams seem to follow the 'best available player' rationale on an ongoing basis.

The downtown branch of this trendy Hollywood party hotel opened in 2002 in a converted 1952, 12-story, marble-clad Superior Oil Co. Building (on the National Register of Historic Places). It's the sleek, mod antidote to the lush Biltmore.
The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the EPA said in a joint statement Monday that the EPA will get more than $36 million worth of environmental claims. They'll be paid from the sale of stock and warrants in the new General Motors and bonds posted by the Old GM to cover cleanup work. The EPA will get $4.6 million in cash and $10.5 million worth of remedial work from companies that issued the bonds, the statement said.
Ross does not. Too many connections are murky. For instance, when Cinna first starts working with Katniss, they are understandably distant, remote. By the time the game begins he's one of her most-trusted friends and advisers. How and when did this happen? And while Ross uses camerawork to distinguish what the contestants are seeing and what the audience watching them sees, we don't get a real feel for the fanaticism of the people watching at home. And some of the effects are, simply, ridiculous, including the parade of contestants -- specifically the bit where Katniss gets her "girl on fire" nickname. She is supposed to look dramatic; instead she looks silly.
In doubles, it was an all-Oro Valley Ironwood Ridge final, as the brother combination of Alec and Cody Perford defeated Josh Taylor and Connor Spiegel 7-6, 6-3.
"My entire career has been a testimony to American exceptionalism," Obama said, pointing to the 2004 Democratic convention speech that lofted him into the running for the presidency.

The next season, he scored 23 or more points in 15 consecutive games, a franchise mark. Later, in the 2009 playoffs, he scored 42 points in Game 2 at Houston, the most in NBA history by a player in his first or second career playoff game.

On the day I got hurt, I watched my team finish off the game with a win. I was fairly confident that we would be able to do the same all week. I trusted my teammates would work hard to pick me up while I couldn't play and step up to win, and they did. Wednesday we had our awaited rematch against Fontbonne where we came out on top and picked up another win.
We disagree. To begin with, an alternative minimum tax rate of 30 percent for the rich is primarily a way of taxing their investment income at that rate. Is that wise? The tax code has carved out a special rate for capital gains to encourage investment. Any move to erode or eliminate that difference ought to be part of a broader tax-reform debate.

Berkman signed a one-year deal with the Cardinals for this season, at a raise to $12 million. He agreed that the spike in salaries has altered the landscape for all middle-order hitters, and Berkman said if he's able to duplicate last year's production - putting him seventh in MVP voting - he could see pursuing a two-year deal to finish out his career.

Butts was not at the judge’s ruling Thursday, but his father, Mikel Butts said afterward that his son needs help. He called Painter “a bully with a badge…maybe he got what he deserved. Maybe he was so full of himself he was going to take care of it his way…there’s another side to the story.”
It's dark as a coal mine in here, which a) creates a bit of romance, especially accompanied by the guitar duo, and b) prevents you from examining the final bill too closely and possibly going into cardiac arrest. It's pricey, and we're not just talking about the $3,000 bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild. What you get in exchange are impeccable service and prime beef aged 28 days -- such as the juicy Angus rib-eye in bordelaise sauce ($70) or the extra thick El Gaucho Steak ($56).
The agency hasn't commented on Chong's claim that he was without basic necessities for days.
"I think with this film, the families, the kids are not traditional documentary subjects," he says. "I see them as partners. I think that agreement was really important, because we were asking a lot of them. I also wanted to make sure that the kids wanted this, because it's a lot to take on."
The city also laid off 53 other city employees, including 30 firefighters. Many of them returned to work earlier this year.

Chasse’s lawyer said Humphreys was trained to know that Chasse’s “rhythmic shuffling,” a rapid walk away, the fear of being around people, as well as incoherent utterances or having abnormal strength are all consistent with mental illness. In fact, on Humphreys’ official police “Use of Force” report on Chasse, he checked the box for mental illness. Then Burton also checked “mental,” not drugs or intoxication.

Our task then is to make our national laws actually work -� to shape a system that reflects our values as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And that means being honest about the problem, and getting past the false debates that divide the country rather than bring it together.

In the days-long struggle over how to avert an unprecedented federal government default, discussions have focused on preserving low taxes, while avoiding the effect spending reductions would have on real Americans. Thus it is disturbing to note that in the debt ceiling debate, funding for Pell Grants remains a bargaining chip rather than a commitment to our aspiring but low-income youth.
