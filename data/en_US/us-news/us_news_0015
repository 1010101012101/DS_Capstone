A combination of higher cost-of-living adjustments and sluggish growth in wages is pinching the fund right now. The report released Monday said reserves would be exhausted by 2033, three years sooner than projected last year. The outlook for Medicare was roughly the same as the previous year. However, that program requires major repairs to remain afloat as the cost of health care rises and the population ages. Together, Social Security and Medicare now account for about a third of the federal budget.

A financial advisory board, though, would prevent overspending and require true-to-the-numbers budgeting, two practices city government have not been able to honor on its own. And a program manager, appointed by the mayor and governor, would lead major initiatives to restructure city government so that it delivers services more effectively and efficiently.

4. There's this weird thing that all "SNL" sketches do: They stall. There are intros that follow intros, and it can be a full minute and a half before you ever get to the meat of a scene. Too much windup, not enough follow-through. The sketches feel like jetliners forced to circle the airport. It's hard to tell if this is intentional or something the writers aren't even aware of anymore, but these delay tactics might be the biggest problem sinking "SNL" sketches.
Serve: Fry calamari by cleaning 1 pound of squid and cutting into 1/2-inch rings. Dust with all-purpose flour and season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour enough oil into a large saucepan to reach a depth of 3 inches. Heat on medium-high, and when hot, carefully add squid in batches. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry until crisp, about 1 minute per batch. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer calamari to paper-towel-lined plates to drain. Serve with lemon wedges.

It's also possible to prepare the batter and fillings for both the Savory Mushroom Crepes and the Moon Crepes ahead, although the actual crepes are better made to order. But making crepes one by one, as the batter sputters in the pan and sends out buttery aromas, is a great excuse to have people over.

There was the boy who brought a pocketful of prescription pills to sell  even though they were non-narcotic drugs aimed at managing schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There was the call from a substitute teacher who reported a dice game in progress  on a science lab table.

But we can't do it if we keep thinking parochially. We can do it if we as a region stop thinking small time and start thinking big and bad and glorious and out of the box. It's time we stopped looking at the region as a doughnut with the city as a great big hole in the middle.

It's a telling image, at once fanciful and suggestive. That lightness of being which Max experiences on a personal level was felt more widely, for example, by thousands of immigrants whose records were destroyed by the quake and fire. Overnight, by default, they attained the buoyancy of citizenship. That's a pivotal point in Maxine Hong Kingston's 1980 book "China Men."

The council president is picked by the council members. While turnover is rare, the council president can be removed at any time from the post once another council member has a majority of votes from his or her colleagues. It will take 10 votes to capture the title.
Berkman said he felt some bite in the calf since returning to the lineup Tuesday night against Cincinnati. On Wednesday, he extended his hitting streak to seven games to start this season with an infield single in the first inning. He raced to beat the play at first, and then he was involved in a double steal before finally sprinting around third to score on David Freese's double. Berkman said he knew there was still soreness in the leg in all that running, but it wasn't until the top of the fifth inning when soreness became injury.

After Indonesia's economy expanded 6.5% last year—its fastest growth since 1996—the World Bank projects it will grow 6.1% this year. However, the bank warned earlier this month that a string of restrictive changes to trade and foreign-investment policies may have longer-term implications for growth and investment.

How much “Story/Time” recycles Jones’ earlier works is unclear. The catch-me-I’m-falling group exercise appeared in “Blind Date;” and the story of Noah and the Flood was central to “Another Evening: I Bow Down.” Some overlapping partnering moves recall “Monkey Run Road,” and the whole evening seems to develop the concepts of Jones’ solo “As I Was Saying.” Yet “Story/Time” is not exactly a Cunningham “Event.”
It's been more than a decade. The city has already spent $13 million. The property does not generate revenue of any kind: the mounted patrol pays no rent on the warehouse they use as a headquarters and horse barn. Portland doesn't have the money for a new park. Architects have estimated redevelopment could run more than $40 million. Simply razing the complex could cost $10 million.

Eurail Pass: If you're traveling long distances over several days and changing trains and countries, the best bet is to buy a Eurail pass rather than individual point-to-point tickets. The passes, available only to non-European residents, come in a dizzying array of combinations and prices. There are student, family, youth, senior and large-group discounts. Prices also vary on how many days you want to travel or how many countries you want to visit. Do your research, plan your trip carefully and you can save money.

Barrett, more than likely, was focused on freeing McCleave, but perhaps he also felt the weight of the nation's future. And perhaps this is why Barrett, an experienced officer, made the mistake that buoyed the sagging rebel forces in what many consider the westernmost battle of the war. His error was costly but not fatal to the Union. The same could not be said of him. He is still out here, buried, it's said, by Interstate 10, along with some of the most interesting and underappreciated history of the American Civil War.

Looking back at some prominent Sept. 11-inspired cultural works — from TV's "Rescue Me" and the films "Man on Wire" and "United 93" to novels by Joseph O'Neill, Jonathan Safran Foer and others — those who kept a certain distance from the attacks generally have proven to be more resonant than those who sought to channel the day's raw agonies in more direct and literal-minded ways. Art, like terrorism, often works by stealth and subterfuge, sneaking up on our intellects and emotions and overwhelming them before we fully realize what's happening.

Harper was booed at his introduction and in each of his four plate appearances, and if he didn’t make like “The Natural,” he didn’t exactly disappoint. Harper went 1-for-3, his first hit a double over the head of Kemp in center that hit the base of the wall and then came up with his run-scoring fly in the ninth.
A screened-in patio is one of the many features that earned Allure Luxury Homes a spot as a 2012 Grand Award Winner for its Coffee Creek Crossing home at 10643 W. 158th Court, Overland Park. The screened-in patio of this two-story, five-bedroom, four-bathroom home is anchored by a stacked rock fireplace and over-sized television cabinet. Homeowners entering the home from the three-car garage will find a large mudroom with a pantry, built-in desk and plenty of storage for coats, keys and sports equipment. Just off the mudroom is a full bathroom with shower and a secluded flex room that can be used as an office or additional bedroom. The rest of the main floor features a chef’s kitchen flowing into a large great room, breakfast area and dining room. Just up the curved staircase are three bedrooms and a master suite with spa tub, double shower, dressing area, walk-in closet and laundry room. The finished lower level has a media room, granite bar and separate room for game nights. There is also plenty of room for storage or later expansion.

“If you’re picked in the second round up here, we expect you to play. The first three picks, you always expect those guys to contribute right away,” Reese said. “He didn’t play a lot last year. He flashed a little bit in a couple of games but we expect him to really come along with some guys who have been here a little bit longer than him (Gerris Wilkinson, Bryan Kehl and Jonathan Goff). We expect those guys to show us what they have. Hopefully, they will do that.”
“This is not the news we were hoping for Greg or the organization,” Blazers President Larry Miller said in a release. “It’s hard to put into words the heartbreak for everyone involved, but especially for Greg.

We have a lot of empathy for Greg and his family during this difficult time.”
Now, we don't know why Lopez was fired. He declined comment, and officials from Chaparral and the Scottsdale Unified School District were not answering questions. But we do know Lopez was canned by the district, which means the issue wasn't performance related. Something else sparked the decision.

Initially, Kissinger acknowledges, he was less drawn to Deng Xiaoping, who was politically rehabilitated after Mao died and guided China's economic modernization during a crucial decade. Kissinger describes Deng's "acerbic, no-nonsense style, his occasional sarcastic interjections and his disdain of the philosophical in favor of the eminently practical … Deng rarely wasted time on pleasantries, nor did he feel it necessary to soften his remarks by swaddling them in parables" as Mao did. Eventually, Kissinger says, he developed "enormous regard for this doughty little man with the melancholy eyes." China today is "a testimonial to Deng's vision, tenacity and common sense," he concludes.
A: Tart. Believe it or not, they do get "sweeter" the longer they stay on the vine. You'll notice dried cranberries are sweeter still, and that's because they're marinated with some form of sugar or fruit juice.

The Buckeyes have 11 scholarship players for next season, though that number would drop to 10 if backup guard Jordan Sibert transfers, which would not be a shock. The Columbus Dispatch reported today that Sibert could be headed to Dayton to play for former OSU assistant Archie Miller.

The seven-member town council first approved the idea in March, but it ignited such controversy that the mayor agreed to put it to a referendum in the hamlet of mostly retirees.
"Are you crying?" Heather asks.
Thanks, Harry. Suddenly, young people, who wouldn't spend much vacation time with their folks, much less get out of bed this early if they didn't have to, think family vacations are fun again, especially when mom and dad or grandpa pay for the trip and pop for $100 wizarding robes (yes, despite the 90-degree Florida heat, fans traipsed around the park in the floor-length robes, wearing Hogwarts ties as belts) or $30 wands.
Publicly, the U.S. and Chinese governments have said nothing about the Chen case. Neither side wants the biggest human-rights issue between the two since Tiananmen Square to damage a working relationship between the world's top importer and exporter, and between the world's biggest military and the fastest developing.

In Wayne, Ford is spending about $550 million to retool its Michigan Assembly Plant with the same manufacturing system to build the Ford Focus, the Focus Electric and possibly several other compact vehicles. Ford previously made the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator at that plant.
But that's OK, because in my haste to avoid consuming more teriyaki, I chose to go with the wild mushroom fried rice with black truffle oil instead. It's a fairly large bowl, where fluffy mounds of grain waft puffs of earthy truffle perfume. Again, at $16, with nary a shaving of real black truffle in sight, there is very little value to be had unless you are served a wheelbarrow of the stuff.

As offensive and inappropriate as those of us here in America for whom being Jewish is central, not peripheral, may find the word "partial," the real issue is Yehoshua's utter disrespect for America's Jews, a disrespect born, I believe, out of misunderstanding. Specifically, he fails to understand that Israel's Jews and America's are, each of us, full-fledged participants in very different cultures. We here have become quite thoroughly American. Our rivers are the Mississippi and the Monongahela, our mountains the Rockies, our legislature the Congress and our authors Chabon and Auslander and Roth, little known in Israel. Theirs are the Jordan, the mountains of Moab and Gilboa, the Knesset and, beyond Amos Oz and David Grossman and A.B. Yehoshua, Meir Shalev, Haim Guri and dozens more entirely unknown here. No matter how common Home Depot and all the rest may be in Israel, Israel is neither New Jersey nor, as Herzl had hoped, Vienna on the Mediterranean; it is in and largely of the Middle East.

Doctors are faced with decreasing incomes and at the same time are beset by a huge proliferation in Medicare billing codes due to fee-for-service payments, and by increasing administrative quality requirements and insurance restrictions. Given the necessary legal responsibility and authority, doctors (not insurers) can define necessary care, which will cut excessive spending and end the fear of unfair, unrestrained use of health care. Doctors tend to resist this proposed responsibility, viewing it as the government again telling them what to do — but many are ready for change. And this would be different: It could work according to rules that would be set by doctors for doctors, doing what federal and insurance company administrators cannot do.

He said it is strongly worded so that taxpayers won't be on the hook if the bridge loses money.

Blepharitis is an inflammatory condition of the eyelids. The symptoms of blepharitis vary but usually include red eyelids; discharge, especially in the morning; an irritated feeling in the eyes, like something is in the eyes; and blurred or fluctuating vision. There are different types of blepharitis, however most cases result from clogging of oil glands in the eyelid, which results in red, inflamed and irritated eyelids. The surface of the eye may be prone to dryness because it is not receiving enough of the moisturizing oily secretions. Blepharitis can also be associated with other skin conditions like psoriasis or rosacea. Because your eyelids always are in contact with your eyes, this redness and inflammation can spread to the surface of the eye. In severe cases, a corneal ulcer (inflammation in the cornea seen as a white spot on the cornea) may occur.

Nike was rolling out its new, overpriced, Third World-made status symbols, and for these sin-ugly psychedelic babies, at $220 plus tax, Nike again kept the prices ridiculously high and the supply extremely limited.

It's not hard to poke holes in the cases of the Knicks and Raptors for getting Nash. New York fired Mike D'Antoni, who coached Nash and Stoudemire to some very good seasons in Phoenix. Toronto does not seem to have the talent to challenge for a playoff spot for a few seasons, much less contend. At Nash's age, that has got to be a major factor, national loyalty aside.
Plain Dealer reviewer Nancy Connors observed that Carey, through his novels, has often shown interest "in the dispossessed, the traveler, the singular person caught up in troubles not entirely of his own making.

Once you get past the jaw-dropping pretentiousness of calling a book "enlightenments from lives on the road" and then filling it mostly with quotes and passages cribbed from your other books, this is actually a pretty fun book.

SUSPICIOUS WOMAN, NOTTINGHAM: A woman approached a Nottingham Drive home at about 4:40 p.m. April 24 and said she was a maintenance worker and needed to fix the sink plumping at the apartment. The resident refused to let her enter. She left in a white or silver car. She was described as a white female in her 20s with brown hair in a pony tail. The property manager said that she had no employees that fit that description. Police patrolled the area but could not locate the suspect.

Wooden bats generally cost less than high-end aluminum bats, but players may break one or two wooden bats throughout the course of a season.
And now there's even an app for doing our taxes. TurboTax for iPhone and Android not only lets you fill out the return, but uses the phone's camera to snap a photo of your W2s to record the data. And speaking of money, my camera-equipped smartphone has relieved me of the one reason I used to have to visit my local bank. Now, instead of driving to a branch, I use the bank's app to take a picture of checks that I'm sent and "phone in" my deposits.
Keep in mind that the Midwest itself is something of a venture-capital backwater, attracting just 5 percent of the money invested nationwide. So not only are we no threat to create a Silicon Valley on the Mississippi; we can't even keep up with the likes of Wisconsin and Indiana.

Among the services JetBlue added to get more business travelers was its Even More Legroom seats, since the airline doesn't offer business or first class. It recently tacked on an Even More Speed option, which allows those customers that buy the roomier seats a chance to jump lines. It's also revamped its frequent flier program and started selling directly to corporations.

With approximately $15 million in salary cap space, the Maloofs need to spend both wisely and generously this summer, and Petrie has to avoid a repeat offseason performance. Arguably, Petrie had a worse year than his team, with the questionable signings of the overweight Chuck Hayes and Travis Outlaw, the unnecessary spending to retain Marcus Thornton, and the draft-day swap that brought back John Salmons.
Sites: Sagami Bay. A 10-minute walk south from Enoden Railway Hase Station brings you to the landing beaches that would have been used by the Eighth Army. The peaceful bay is fringed with houses, surf shops and small restaurants. The Great Buddha of Kamakura is five minutes north of the station. Shops along the street to the temple sell treats, including mitarashi dango, rice dumplings on a stick covered in a sugary soy sauce. Nearby is Hase Temple, with sweeping views of the bay. The Enoden is a trolley-like train that makes its way through the back yards and lanes from its terminal next to the main Japan Rail station in Kamakura.

It's our loss if we miss either, since there are worthy drinks like a Georgia Peach martini ($10). If not traditional, it's still delicious, with peach puree, orange juice, simple syrup and sparkling white wine, served up. The sweet potato bread pudding ($6) is notable as well, cut in a loose hunk of fluffy, not-too-sugary cake and dolloped with vanilla ice cream. My tablemates argued over who got the extra crispy, extra browned ridges on the top crust.
The two sides reached a tentative deal last month to fund the estimated $391 million arena that would open for the 2015-16 season in the downtown Sacramento rail yards. The Sacramento City Council already passed its end of the deal, brokered by the league and tentatively agreed to by the Kings.

After waiting two hours, today's hearing was canceled with little explanation.

Theories on how our system grew so insular: First, Kitzhaber was right. Given the state's initiative system, the city's commission structure and the ideological divide between Multnomah County and almost everywhere else, this place does tend toward ungovernable.
When Andrews returned last spring after playing the past four seasons in Spain, Bosnia, Turkey and Japan, he began calling the Kings' switchboard, hoping somehow to get through to Geoff Petrie. Six, seven, eight times he estimates he dialed the main switchboard number. In a fluke, he was finally transferred to the basketball operations department. He left a long, rambling message, citing his background and making his case for a tryout.
I followed up with the house burger with American cheese, lettuce, red onion, tomato and a pickle for $5. It's a really good burger. I added beer-batter onion rings for $3.
Cairo's meats will be crafted in an isolated 800-square-foot space with science-lab-like cold rooms and a hot-and-humid "incubator" used to develop the tangy flavor of some traditional salamis such as Genoa and fennel seed-flecked finocchiona with the aid of a powdered lactobacillus culture. Although most of the production will be unseen by restaurant patrons, one curing room will be visible through a window behind a 16-seat restaurant counter topped by a 12-foot-long cold case (similar to the case at a sushi bar) full of finished product. Another 16 seats will run along a banquette parallel to the counter.

One of the reviews, published in the journal of the American College of Nutrition in 2009, found that there may be important differences depending on the type of omega-3 supplement. Fish oil contains two types: DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid). Studies that used pure DHA or more than 50% DHA reported no effect on depression. Studies using pure EPA or more than 50% EPA found that symptoms improved.
VIKINGS HAD OFFERS: Vikings GM Rick Spielman told ESPN today that he had multiple offers for his No. 3 pick, and that he was talking to teams besides the Browns up until two hours before the draft.

The fourth rounder, 118 overall, was acquired last year in the trade with Atlanta.

The new toll for E-ZPass users is now $9.50 during peak hours, and $12 for cash customers. The discounted off-peak toll for E-ZPass users is $7.50. There is no discount for cash-payers, who cost the agency more to process because they require toll takers. Tolls will rise in yearly increments until 2015, when peak crossings will cost $12.50 for E-ZPass payers and $15 for cash customers.

Notes: The Buckeyes arrived in Florida on Tuesday and will hold their first practice Wednesday morning at the University of North Florida. The Florida Gators, with their campus just 70 miles away in Gainesville, practiced in Jacksonville on Tuesday. . . . Ohio State is staying in a hotel on the property of the TPC Sawgrass, a golf course that hosts a PGA Tour event and features the well-known island green on the 17th hole. Several players toured the course Tuesday, while a few took shuttles to the beach. . . . A team welcome dinner was held at the hotel, with most of the players wearing black golf shirts with an OSU logo. It brought to mind the attire glitch of two years ago when quarterback Terrelle Pryor and two other players were prevented by Jim Tressel from attending a dinner at a prime rib restaurant the week of the Rose Bowl because they were wearing jeans. Back then, that qualified as a Buckeye controversy.

We endlessly debate the morality of our Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Yet nobody argues over the virtue of the war on drugs, fought on our behalf and partly at our expense — we spend nearly $500 million a year on it outside our borders.
Congressional term limits. Orlando Republican Sandy Adams is one of a few legislators pushing for congressional term limits. The effort may be popular on the campaign trail, where Adams is running for Congress herself. But the impact of this legislation probably won't mean much, since it's essentially just a resolution urging Congress to take action. By the way, the last time term limits were debated locally was when former U.S. Rep. Ric Keller said he had a right to break his promise to run only four times — and voters disagreed.

On a few of this album's early songs, a perplexing amount of digital effects are applied to Underwood's vocals, processing she neither needs nor benefits from, even if it is par for the course for other country singers. She may be unhappy, but hearing her tense up is half the fun.
Middle East diplomacy requires enormous sensitivity. Jerusalem is the fault line in 5,000 years of emotionally charged history. That means the megaphone should be used sparingly, and the pressure should be reserved for times when it really serves a useful purpose.

Like the Dodgers, the Nationals aren't a high-scoring team. Through Wednesday, they were averaging 3.8 runs per game compared with 4.2 for the Dodgers. Their cleanup hitter, Michael Morse, is out because of an injured side muscle and not expected back until midseason. Third baseman Ryan Zimmerman could also land on the disabled list soon because of a shoulder injury.

“It was a tough job when I took it on a lot of fronts,” Dickerson recalled recently. "Three years before that there was some talk within the university of going Division III. On the heels of that, there was a lot of skepticism about Tulane basketball and Tulane athletics. Then Katrina hits, which made it an almost impossible job.”

When our tanks were about two-thirds empty, we were supposed to alert the dive master so she could lead everyone to the surface. Dad's oxygen gauge was dangerously low, so we signaled to the dive master. Dad switched his regulator (mouthpiece) with her spare one, often a last resort. At the surface, we received a firm but uncondescending lecture from the dive master about the importance of never letting that happen again. Ever.

His second show in 1961 featured a now-famous poster of Price casually riding a Pacific wave on his surfboard, arms held high with his name printed in a rainbow-arch between outstretched hands. It included small, sleek, brightly painted "eggs" with sexually provocative fingers of tangled clay erupting from dark orifices. Friend and fellow artist Edward Ruscha once described them as "psycho-erotic." The stylistic break with Voulkos was complete. The beautifully crafted and brightly painted work was as effortless and triumphant as the playful surfing poster implied.

“I don’t believe in sending song files all over the world,” says Birch, whose recordings have the immediacy of a live performance. “There’s something magical that happens when you get a group of musicians together in the same place.

Sajid recently handed out campaign brochures after a popular weekly prayer service at the mosque.

She said the configuration provided audio problems for people who were sitting in the back of the room.
Holding on to all of these rustic, but much-beloved, camps does not seem the best use of the Girl Scouts' resources, especially if the camps don't appeal to a majority of the membership. Many scouts -- and, more important, their mothers, who often serve as camp volunteers and chauffeurs -- want camping to be more like home: indoor toilets, electricity and showers, according to the organization's survey. And because so few scouts go camping, the organization has had to spend over $1 million annually to subsidize the seven camps.

It was an abrupt and stunning turnabout for a proud franchise that had made the playoffs the past three seasons. It was a high-priced and experienced roster, and entering the season, the intrigue wasn't whether the team could reach the playoffs, it was whether the team could advance to the second round, or beyond. But even when the team raced to a 7-2 start, and found itself perched atop the Western Conference, all while garnering praise from Charles Barkley as one of the best teams in the West, McMillan never believed it.
“It’s such a wonderful thing that they do,” she says. “And when I can give back someday, I will.”

Wisconsin coach Bret Bielema made the right calls in aggressively using his timeouts on defense during Michigan State's last drive Saturday night in an attempt to get the ball back.

The Charge will have to carry on without their leading scorer and rebounder, but the Cavs had no choice after losing yet another player to injury on Tuesday at Detroit, where starting small forward Alonzo Gee sat out with an ankle injury.

“It was something that was swept under the rug,” said Rebecca Durst, the owner of Rinaldo’s Barber Shop across the street from campus. “It’s been in the rumor mill for a long time — Sandusky’s behavior.

The crux of the early festival that continues today is pirates, namely high society members in pirate outfits, capturing the city.

Lohse led the Cardinals' rotation in wins and he had the lowest ERA of the staff. He did that despite being skipped, pushed back and generally jerked around at times during the season. As much as his numbers look good against his peers, the way the club shifted him around and took care to skip his start at one point is just as revealing. The club was, midway through the season, concerned about his inconsistency. Manager Tony La Russa at one point suggested that he felt Lohse was ailing physically but not acknowledging it to the team. Lohse insisted that he didn't seek treatment from the trainers because he didn't need it.

Climate change is a nonpartisan, nondenominational, non-nationalistic issue. We can work together on it—Republicans and Democrats, people of all religious faiths, the United States and other countries. Canada's prime minister has said that if the United States introduces this system, Canada will join in. We need to do this wonderful thing and we need to do it now. Waiting can only make the climate crisis worse, more and more rapidly. Acting now can begin to build a benign new world for our children.

The lending gains are being driven in part by a retreat by European lenders tied to the region's debt crisis. As banks on the continent sell assets to raise capital and reduce their dependence on scarce dollar funding, big U.S. lenders are stepping in.

Legs. Really? Legs have nothing to do with the flavor, but they are an excellent indication of the character of the wine. Legs form on the inside of a glass when you swirl wine. When a wine is thin (light) it will sheet off like water. If the wine is viscous (thick) it will leave a thicker sheet on the glass and the wine will slowly fall from the inside of the glass. The slowness and thickness of these legs indicate that a wine will be rich in character and heavy with fruit and alcohol.

"People in a small village like this know each other. They are helping each other out."

Rams coach Steve Spagnuolo is 10-38 in three seasons and his job is believed to be in jeopardy. Announced attendance was 55,990, about 9,000 short of capacity at the Edward Jones Dome, but the stadium appeared no more than half full and drained quickly after halftime.
Beane and the A's, however, should expect nothing but Ramirez's best effort. Earning just enough money to keep his million-dollar shoes polished this season, Ramirez should use every at-bat in 2012 as a public audition for any American League teams looking for a designated hitter next season.
Folks who only know Taylor as a pop-culture caricature should find some of her films on Netflix or during late-night channel-flipping and catch her unique artistry. They're in for a rich surprise.
