That's a running theme in "You Think That's Bad," which balances an understanding of history with a recognition that we may be living at the end of history, at a place where narrative can go only so far. Again and again, Shepard gives us characters at the edge of their endurance, not just at the end of their ropes but at the end of their lives. In "The Track of the Assassins," a female British explorer of the 1930s goes in search of the legendary Hassan-i Sabbah and his band of assassins; although she initially impresses her guides ("One evening apropos of nothing [Ismail] remarked that it was no wonder England was a mighty nation, since its women did what Persian men feared to attempt"), the story ends with her weak from malaria and dysentery, staring down eternity "with [her] hands upon [her] breasts." In "Poland Is Watching," a pair of Polish mountaineers — friends since childhood — become the first climbers to reach the summit of Nanga Parbat, "the world's ninth-tallest mountain," only to succumb to the snow, wind and cold.

With the exception of the clientele and a waitress or two, practically nothing has changed at the Manor since the doors first opened in 1967.

Bill Clinton has some advice for Democrats heading into the 2012 elections, and you don't have to read very far into his new book to realize that what he has to say should be of particular interest to the current occupant of the White House. The former president thinks President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats have the right policies but have done a poor job of getting their message out. Mr. Clinton is worried that if that doesn't change, the Democrats will face another Republican shellacking like the one they endured in 2010. With this slender volume, "Back to Work: Why We Need Smart Government for a Strong Economy," he seeks to fill that void.

Mendocino doesn't list this as either a regular or a seasonal brew, but it has an impressive-looking silvery label featuring two raptor birds with challenging expressions, so they're evidently committed to it.

Located in a space formerly occupied by Fellini, Divino does much with little. White cloth napkins adorn worn wood tables. The awnings and nonstructural walls are gone. Drum lights cast a soft, diffused light, even while sunshine streams through banks of 6-by-6-foot windows. Shelving behind a new six-seat wine bar is practically - tastefully - empty.

"A 12-year-old, particularly a boy, still has one foot in childhood: toys, activities, things he likes to play with. Whereas a 14-year-old has crossed completely into a new social world where he's leaving objects and toys in favor of social media and is becoming highly status-conscious. His thinking starts to become more abstract and he's looking at his identity and society and how he fits into it.

Learn Now, Build Later members say the bond is badly planned.

They also say the district should close or consolidate small schools like Markham, Faubion and Marysville to save money in the long run rather than rebuild them bigger and better.

A major earthquake will hit Southern California. We need to prepare now for the recovery. In a time of growing concern over the national debt, we should proactively address this issue to protect you, other taxpayers, and California's fragile economy.

Such is life for the 15 disciples of the quirkiest coach in Division I college basketball. Players come and go in Roy Williams’ system, absorbing the intricacies of the “Tar Heel Running Game” — a relentless transition offense that forces opponents into track meets they seldom win.

Also floating amid a sea of stereotypes is a memory-addled mother (Sissy Spacek), one who gets smarter but never increasingly ill (as normally might occur) as she needs to gain some revenge on her rich, racist, restroom-obsessed ringleader of a daughter (Bryce Dallas Howard).

David Duncan created a Serge Roche-inspired centerpiece whose base was a crystal-beaded galleon. "When I found it in an antique store in Belgium, I didn't know what I would do with it," Mr. Duncan said of the ship model.

As a parting gift, he gave the female diners at his table enamel bangles in the colors of his table, and the male ones classic novels like "Moby Dick" that evoke the sea.

The Affordable Care Act was a compromise. Mr. Obama brought everyone to the table -- doctors, insurance companies, drug companies, hospitals -- and came away with a "best we can get" kind of bill.

Notable: Wisconsin (6-0) and MSU (5-1) are two of three teams with unbeaten Big Ten records. They're in different divisions, so this could be a preview of the conference's first title game on Dec. 3.

Adam Duff, a 32-year old wildlife biologist from Idaho, shops for kid toys to engage a team of eight South African penguins. But he goofed when he gave them a penguin plush puppet.
This is a half-truth. The U.S. ranks 43rd internationally in infant mortality, according to United Nations figures for the years 2005 to 2010. Unfortunately, there is no consistent standard for reporting infant deaths across countries. The U.S. scores lower because doctors here count as failures extreme cases in which the odds of survival were so low that foreign doctors don't count them at all.
It�s easy to screw up America�s favorite brunch cocktail � too much pepper, too much Worcestershire sauce, too much Tabasco, too much vodka, any V8 � the list of possible transgressions is long. But a good Bloody Mary is a beautiful thing indeed, as comforting as a BLT in a glass, as rousing as a burst of sunshine breaking through a wall of thick fog. Such a one is Blue Grotto�s San Marzano Bloody Mary, which uses the juices of imported canned San Marzano tomatoes from Italy. Blue Grotto owner John Grier has been making his version of America�s favorite pick-me-up for 20 years, and his lips are sealed as to the precise recipe. The garnishes, of course, are plain to see: lime and three olives. Three cheers for banishing the celery stalk, which too often injects jarring crunching and munching into what should be a genteel sipping experience.

Cahokia, the home of the Downtown St. Louis Airport and other aviation businesses, is a town in transition. The population has steadily declined, from 17,550 in 1990 to what census figures estimated at 15,103 in 2008. Approval of a budget, without which the village share of property taxes cannot be collected, is becoming critical. Vital services such as police protection and street repairs are at stake.

Across large swaths of the bucolic British countryside, there is no such thing as trespassing. The British staunchly protect and defend their right to amble wherever their feet may take them — even across fenced-in pastures. It was enshrined in a national Right to Roam law in 2000, but the impulse dates back almost two centuries, when poet William Wordsworth described the Lake District as "a sort of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy."
The sisters, who had been standing a few feet apart, one before her keyboard, the other with her guitar, left their microphones and met at the center of the stage. We want you all to be quiet, one of them said. They wanted to sing a cappella and depend strictly on the acoustics of the place to carry their voices. When a hush fell on the place, and the sisters began singing "Ghost Town," it was an unnervingly communal moment, one where the audience was as responsible for a song as the artists who'd produced it.
But they were not eligible for money. DeWine said that individuals who received a prepaid debit card as part of the "special stimulus program" should not cash the card or spend any money on it, because the refund is not legitimate.
Green epitomized that. He improved more from his junior year to his senior year than any player I can remember. Michigan State's best player also was its best leader and hardest worker. That matters so much in basketball.

Despite all the troubles making it, "L&S" was a hit and never dissuaded Marshall from his lifelong belief that if you keep your enemies close, you keep your family even closer. Nepotism is not a dirty word in Marshall's vocabulary. In addition to Penny, he's had virtually every member of his family on the payroll at one time or another. His son, Scott, played a skateboarding drug dealer in "Pretty Woman," his sister, Ronny, has been a producer on many of his projects, his grandkids have had bit parts in movies such as "The Princess Diaries 2," and he even hired his dad to oversee the payroll on "Laverne & Shirley."

The suit, filed on Friday, alleges that mayoral candidate Clifford Minor, council candidates John Sharpe James and Ras Baraka, along with their election campaigns, issued disparaging fliers and made slanderous public statements about the police director, claiming that he had a history of domestic violence, that he was involved in a DWI violation, and that he "impregnated a number of Newark females" — charges which the suit claims are "outrageous."
Stands in Uproar
I don't recall exactly which game it was in 2010, but the Timbers started celebrating a win at around the 87-minute mark, only to see the opponent score a goal or two afterward, either causing a tie or loss for us. I've done a lot to erase that memory, but I'll never forget the lesson: no celebrations until after the final whistle blows.
"I've been saying it for three or four days now, we're in and out of the scoring areas too quick," he said. "We've had tons of opportunities, but they're all original (shots) and out. We're not holding our position long enough to get the second and third whacks that we were before. We've wanted to hit the home run right away and, if it doesn't happen, we're out of the area."

Edwards is a convicted felon with an extensive violent criminal history in San Francisco.
Bill Patzert, a climatologist at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif., calls La Nina the "diva of drought," because it usually robs southern states of rain.

After the defeat, the team's seventh straight loss, Spagnuolo told reporters he was "very proud in a lot of ways. Obviously the results are not what we wanted. There were some things we couldn't control, other things we could. I certainly think we should be better than 2-14.

“As for Channing, I never met him until this movie and can’t believe how great he was: funny, sharp, knowing his way around comedy. I think that kind of interaction shows up on screen.”
Whedon keeps a tight rein on some potentially unwieldy material, and the result is a film that simultaneously should please purists (one of which he is) as well as those who aren't necessarily comic-book aficionados. He also stays true to the characters while establishing a tone that's very much his own. As he did with the recent horror hit "The Cabin in the Woods," which he co-wrote and produced, Whedon has come up with a script that's cheeky and breezy, full of witty banter and sly pop-culture shout-outs as well as self-referential humor, one that moves with an infectious energy that (almost) makes you lose track of its two-and-a-half-hour running time.
"Obviously, all border governors are welcome and encouraged to attend, although the governors of Arizona and Texas have said they are not interested in joining a dialogue with their border colleagues," Gallegos said in a statement.
The case was dropped and settled out of court. The $2,400 payment to the O'Fallon, Mo. representing the hotel was described as "constituent services" on Wright-Jones' campaign account.

His great-great grandfather traveled by covered wagon to Oregon in 1852 carrying a pair of rudimentary field glasses. Marshall's parents, Earl A. and Dorothy B. Marshall, were among the earliest members of what is now Audubon Society of Portland. And Marshall spent what he called the happiest years of his life -- the last 13 -- married to his high-school sweetheart, Georgia Leupold Marshall, whose family has made precision optics for birders, hunters and others for more than a century.
øRobinson doesn't want to just rely on rebooted versions of old Earth 2 characters, though. "What's fun is to try and create some new characters you haven't seen before that hopefully readers will respond to. We can build on that and make the Earth 2 universe exciting and diverse as well as having those elements that are familiar."
Other artists include Andre Miripolsky, Rick von Dehl, Sammy Harkham and Richard Duardo.

The new $2 million bridge extends nearly 750 feet.
Crowds gather, including family members of Harris, who live less than 50 yards from where he lies dead. His mother arrives. Detective Paul Sarabando crosses under the police tape and breaks it to her. She falls into the arms of other women, and her cries wash over the crime scene, which is eerily quiet with all streets closed. Spray painted on a wall where she mourns is gang graffiti of the Brick City Brims, the Bloods sect her son belonged to — before he became the 70th homicide victim in Essex County this year.
Still, he held it up proudly for the camera, mugging near the yellow Lamborghini he was driving — the one with the "BULLOWME" license plate.
Cruz spent training camp trying to convince the coaching staff to keep him on the roster. But his most convincing case came on Monday Night Football, when he reeled in a highlight-worthy 64-yard, one-handed touchdown catch and followed on the next drive with a 34-yard touchdown before sealing the game with a five-yard score.

Everywhere he campaigns, Baily admitted, people say to him, "But Bobby Rush was a Black Panther." And they mean that as a compliment.
James was one of those artists. Her forceful, influential, frequently electrifying singing effortlessly bridged the gaps between blues, soul, jazz, R&B and rock. Over her five-decade recording career, she cut 30 albums and released more than 50 singles, including the definitive versions of "All I Could Do Was Cry," "Tell Mama" and "I’d Rather Go Blind." But she’ll be remembered best not for any particular record she cut — although the smoldering "At Last" has become a standard — but for the passion she brought to the material she sang, and the raw, confessional quality of her performances.
The driver did not require medical attention, officials have said. The man told police that Lewis reached over the front seat and punched him in the face, causing his nose to bleed, according to the affidavit Franklin police Detective Bryan Stillwell filed in Superior Court in Somerville.
Experts say the condition Brown suffered, called deep vein thrombosis, can develop within hours.
While politicians got in trouble in 2011, he said the year was mostly quiet for African-Americans, unlike past years, when everyone from Tiger Woods to Serena Williams to Chris Brown to Kanye West made headlines.

A week from today, barring some late move, one of them will be introduced with his teammates at Comerica Park on Opening Day. Or maybe two of them will -- Below apparently remains a candidate for the bullpen opening as well as the rotation vacancy.
The news came after an extensive 40-day search by a six-person committee headed by acting athletic director Dave Joyner. Joyner and his colleagues were remarkably closemouthed during the process, though the AD did indicate he was looking for someone who exemplified Paternos best qualities.

After graduation, Lindsey found work with small parts in local theaters before launching his professional career with significant roles in Broadway plays All-American and Wonderful Town, which led him to Los Angeles with the dream of being a television actor.
Luckily, however, an antidote exists for the hear-no-evil, see-no-evil position that allowed a critical gap to open in legal accountability in county governance. The advent of Cuyahoga County's new charter government -- under which Mason, an architect of the reforms, escapes immediate replacement -- presents an opportunity for change.

What he leaves in child-accessible drawers - and why - are thoroughly your business. How he views casual (and non-casual) sex is thoroughly your business. How well he tended to his health in his oat-sowing phase is thoroughly your business, especially since you apparently haven't availed yourselves of his "assortment of condoms."
