Shams in both styles are $98; blankets run $218 to $338, depending on size. www.pendletonusa.com. - Fort Worth Star-Telegram

Enter the modern suction dredge, which vacuums sand, gravel and stones from the river bottom, then sends it all through a floating sluice where the gold, heavier than the rest of the material, sinks and is trapped, while the remainder is returned to the river.

Those spaces help oxygenate the water and provide habitat for insects that salmon and other fish eat. Dredging also clouds the water with sediment.

The Sacramento Philharmonic is dutifully on hand to fill the theater with joyful noise. You know Aunt Myrtle and Uncle Sal from Billings are going to want to see it.

One of the many quotable lines in “Don Quixote” by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra is “He who sings frightens away his ills,” so it seemed perfectly logical that Dan Wasserman’s 1959 TV play starring Lee J. Cobb based on the classic 17th-century novel would become a musical called “Man of La Mancha.”

On Friday, officials from law enforcement agencies across the state said they were acting on advice from Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler to stop the practice, pending a possible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Gansler has not said whether he intends to appeal. The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled 5-2 on Tuesday that collecting DNA samples from someone arrested but not convicted violates the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.

Yet computers have made much of that revision process less visible — as Boyle puts it, revising "happens in outer space and disappears" — but the Ransom Center is undeterred.

Complaints among ordinary Afghans that Mr. Karzai isn't doing enough to prevent civilian deaths at the hands of foreign troops are sure to intensify, and the political balancing act the Afghan leader has to perform in response to such criticisms will undoubtedly complicate President Obama's strategy for winding down the war.
"Of course I'm disappointed," said Heather Peters, who brought the suit, "but I'm still glad that I raised awareness that Honda is no longer the great brand that it used to be. They used to go the extra mile in customer service; now they go the extra mile fighting customers in court."

To ensure they are heard -- not just now but after Election Day -- Paul and his followers are working to gain a permanent foothold in the Republican Party nationwide.

Last year at the World General Assembly Meeting of International Art Associations (IAA) in Mexico/Guadalajara, Turkey's National Committee (UPSD) President Bedri Baykam presented a proposal suggesting Leonardo da Vinci's birthday, April 15, be declared World Art Day. The proposition was co-signed and presented by Rosa Maria Burillo Velasco of Mexico, Anne Pourny of France, Liu Dawei of China (Ex-President), Christos Symeonides of Cyprus, Anders Lidén of Sweden, Kan Irie of Japan, Pavol Kral of Slovakia, Dev Chooramun of Mauritius and Hilde Rognskog of Norway. It was voted on and unanimously accepted by the IAA's General Assembly and on April 15, 2012, the first World Art Day was celebrated.

Colorado believes it has a gem in Pomeranz, and as such, the organization seems intent on giving the white-glove treatment to its shiny young pitcher. He will open the season at the back of the rotation, not scheduled to get his first start until April 15, all part of a plan designed to cap Pomeranz at 170 innings of work in 2012.
"Not only has economy has a hand in bringing forth this downward turn, but technology has," Warke said.

Finally, toward the end of Hart's chemo regimen, she agreed to meet. Over coffee, Hart discovered how nurturing and empowering it felt to talk to someone else who'd endured breast cancer and its physical and emotional aftermath, as Henifin had. Learning from someone else's journey began to help ease hers.
Missouri companies shipped nearly $13 billion worth of products overseas last year. The bid to boost cargo flights at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport - with or without the seemingly dead Aerotropolis tax credit package - is built around shipping far more. Last week, Congress OK'd free-trade pacts with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. This week, Gov. Jay Nixon is leading a trade delegation to China.

The crossing operated unusually on the day of the deadly collision, according to the testimony of a BNSF employee. The warning gate is supposed to automatically drop down about 30 seconds before the arrival of a train, giving drivers plenty of time to stop.

Oracle Arena in Oakland will have Van Halen, a collection of country music stars that includes Kenny Chesney and Tim McGraw, Aerosmith and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
The greatest lament about what has happened during the last 10 years, inevitably, will be that we lost the sense of unity we had in the fall of 2001. It is an appealing sentiment to think that we might have used that spirit to place ourselves on a better path, or that we might now be able to rekindle it to achieve some great national purpose. But the question is, what purpose, and with whose idea about how to achieve it? Unity of opinion has never been a hallmark of this nation founded by revolutionaries. Even in times of shared purpose — the Depression, World War II, the Cold War — we have always had robust debates about what path to take. It is the nature of our national character, and any attempt to use the memory of an event like Sept. 11 to quash political dissent only cheapens the losses we suffered that day.

In a recent column in The New Yorker, Louis Menand explains why Mitt Romney agrees with this view. “For the nation to grow economically, American companies must become more productive, business has to be allowed to be business. This means that Americans have to tolerate, to appreciate, even to encourage what Romney calls ... ‘creative destruction. ’ ... Who or what stands in the way of restoring America’s productivity and American greatness? ... Romney thinks that unions ... are protectors of the status quo.”

Pizza arrived, smoking hot, with a tart tomato sauce and loads of stringy cheese ($3 per slice of cheese, $12 per 14-inch pie). The house-made crust was thick and chewy — somewhere in between New York's paper-thin style and Chicago deep dish — with a savory flavor that provided a good base for toppings and still managed to hold its own.

Jayne Houdyshell, Follies
He has good top-end speed and acceleration in the open field, but struggles to get enough burst to separate in short areas. An elongated stride makes it difficult for him to run sharp routes. Much of his production came from making plays at the point of the catch and after; he doesn't get himself open through route-running. He is an all-or-nothing blocker who can't recover after whiffing, and will have to improve in that area. His stride hampers his ability to change direction and could be his biggest problem in the NFL, where he'll be covered by premier athletes.
Rising pension costs will eat up much of the tax increase. Illinois borrowed money in the last two years to make contributions to its public pension funds. This year, under pressure to stop adding to its debt, the legislature must make its pension contributions out of tax money.

For 11 years, she has served as deputy director at Santa Monica Museum of Art, located about 1,800 miles west of St. Louis.

Danielle gets the finger: Danielle finds out that Kim D. has asked Teresa and Jacqueline and heads to the store to confront her about inviting “enemies.” When Danielle shows up at Posche, Donna, who works for Kim D., tells Danielle that Kim isn't in, which for some reason perturbs Danielle, who storms out of the store and calls her daughter to tell her there’s “a situation.” Is there any human interaction for Danielle that doesn’t qualify as “a situation”? Picking up her dry cleaning, maybe? Danielle: “The lady’s behavior at the desk I found to be unacceptable behavior for somebody who is supposed to be greeting a money-paying customer.” As opposed to someone who pays in livestock? Danielle asks Donna to have Kim D. call her when she gets in. Kim D. returns and gives Danielle a call. Danielle goes ballistic on her, saying she got Donna to be rude to her. Danielle returns to the store and says she's furious that Donna held up a finger to her (the second one, not the middle one) while she wrapped up a phone call. “This is what she did to me," Danielle freaks. "This is rude. This is wrong. And this was your way of saying, 'I can have my employees treat you anyway I want.'” She says she's hurt and betrayed. Kim D. basically tells her to take a hike, but Kim D. calls her later to ask her to let bygones be bygones. Come to the show, Kim D. says. "There's not going to be any craziness. It's a country club ... I'm not going to let anything bad happen." Yah. Kim D. has no idea what kind of crazy she’s invited to her fashion show, Danielle says. So Danielle does have at least an ounce of self-awareness.

Which is what Kitzhaber should have done -- and still should. A wrongful conviction is immoral, a wrongful death even more so. There is no appeal from wrongful death. Even the three reforms proposed above will not change that. And while it may be possible morally to justify execution in the most heinous of cases, it is not possible to ensure doing so without error. And so the justification for capital punishment fails. No reform can save it.

Comment: Adams is a giant man with a giant cloud over his head: He reportedly tested positive for marijuana at the combine. Failing a test is one thing; failing a test you know is coming is another. Had other character/off-field issues at Ohio State, including tattoo scandal. If true, the positive test at the combine almost certainly knocked him out of first round. If Adams walks a straight line, the payoff could be big. Plays hard and imposes his will. Flexible. Long arms (34 inches) and huge hands (11 inches) enable him to control rushers.

So investors - including the folks who run your 401(k), most likely - jumped into value funds and foreign funds.

A: Knowing your opponent is No. 1, and knowing your help defense. You're only as good as your help, so you want to force them there. And you always hope to take away their favorite move. If you're guarding LeBron (James), you want to give him space and make him beat you from the outside. On pick-and-rolls you hope to beat him to the spot.

When I started smoking in high school, I didn't mess around: Camel straights. The R.J. Reynolds Company has since practiced "brand dilution." They took a traditional product, their "I'd walk a mile for a Camel," and trashed the brand with Camel filters, Camel lights, Camel menthols, Kamel Reds, etc., to where saying "Camels" to a clerk inspired more questions than muttering "coffee" to a barista.

That wasn’t the only time Clemons swapped his trademark tenor for a baritone. In the early ’70s, he kept another tool in his shed: a lilting soprano saxophone; on more recent tours, he covered the top end with a pennywhistle. Reeds weren’t all he did — with the E Street Band, Clemons also proved himself an able percussionist and an enthusiastic backing vocalist, too.
CLEVELAND, Ohio — Much of the preseason talk about the Gladiators revolved around the offense, and for good reason. The Gladiators returned arena legend John Dutton at quarterback and three quality receivers -- Dominick Goodman, Robert Redd and Thyron Lewis.
Our waiter, backed by a suave French sommelier adept at pairing wines, recommended the scallion and egg white fried rice ($12) to go with the main courses, particularly the pork shank braised with star anise, cloves, fennel, ginger and rock sugar ($22) served in a ring of crunchy sauteed pea shoots. The waiter boned the meat tableside, pulled away the mahogany-hued skin and put it on a separate plate. Melting in the mouth like foie gras, its unctuous explosion of fat transformed the otherwise dry meat.

And we watched the instructors perform the Heimlich maneuver for choking victims on each other.

I was reading the paper and I was appalled and saddened when I read about the park in Chesterfield that does not like pit bulls. That's a shame. Are they discriminating against everybody and everything now. I mean we discriminate against people; we discriminate against races; we discriminate against animals. It depends on how a person trains an animal. If they receive love, they give back love. If they're beaten and abused, how do you think they'll act? They shouldn't punish an animal because it's the human being that's responsible, not the animal. That's too bad. If those people in Chesterfield can't accept an animal in their park, who are they going to expect.

Still, anyone who doubts the British influence, says my Republican insider friend, wasn't invited to Ms. Rice's surprise 50th birthday party last fall thrown by U.K. Ambassador David Manning. He recounts how Ms. Rice had been uncharacteristically tricked, thinking that she was off for a small dinner with friends at a tony Washington restaurant. She instead landed at Mr. Manning's embassy, where 120 guests were waiting for a black-tie celebration. Ms. Rice quickly changed into something more appropriate, a red Oscar de la Renta dress (said to be her favorite designer). President Bush, who would name her as his secretary of state three days later, joined shortly thereafter.

To its credit, the school does have men and women's golf teams and a sport management major, but there is no emphasis on golf course management or maintenance from what I found on its website. My instincts, though, tell me not to expect an instant decimation of the course, which is a small local track with pretty reasonable rates.
O'Meara and Browne, whose professional careers reside at opposite ends of the spectrum, turned the traditionally demanding back nine of the Inverness Club into their private birdie sanctuary on and appear to have turned the 156-player event into a two-horse race.

Instead of drill here drill now (drill here, spill now), instead of implying that drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Preserve is insignificant, tell us how to leave oil behind and use today's technology to make the U.S. energy independent with cleaner energy such as fuel cells, solar, wind and natural gas. Instead of clinging to old dirty fossil fuel ways, move us forward!

But the pièce de résistance at this modern chrome- and glass-decorated spot is the steamed fish head casserole with special hot pepper.

The White House has no opinion about how the grant money was spent, spokesman Jay Carney said.

I am deeply saddened by the loss of Congressman Donald Payne, a man whose devotion to public service has spanned four decades and whose work has touched the lives of so many. Donald was a selfless leader who never lost sight of the needs of working families both in America and abroad. He will be remembered for his steadfast commitment to improving civil rights and education, but also for his leadership in advancing social justice around the world. Particularly, through his work on the African continent, Donald has singlehandedly raised awareness on critical human rights issues around the globe. He will certainly be missed by those he served in New Jersey as well as the countless others whose lives have improved because of his advocacy.

The next day, Jan. 27, another article appeared – "Getting El Toro spick and span." It said the last major pollution cleanup at the old El Toro Marine base has now begun and the groundwater cleanup process is under way and this process is not expected to interfere with development of the Great Park. This article said some nearby Woodbridge residents had voiced their concern that contaminated groundwater could still exist, but that the Navy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency have refuted their concern because it's four miles away from the nearest drinking water.

The stitches weren't factory-uniform, and the hems in the hood sometimes went from a quarter-inch wide to an eighth-inch to three-eighths. The buttonhole stitching around the eyeholes looks more like it was done with a buttonhole attachment on one of those old treadle-style sewing machines.

The students have their own favorite elements, too; hanging out at Powell Hall seems to be the constant. D'akhia Brown, 8, enjoys playing the xylophone. The best moment for Stephon Parott, 8, is his line: "Where did Mr. Woodwind go? He was just here a minute ago!"
