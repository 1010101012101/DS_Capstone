In the course of assembly, Bulan works with an "artistic welder" before the steel is sandblasted down to raw metal in preparation for several coats of international orange, the official paint color of the Golden Gate Bridge. He makes it a point to use all materials sourced from within the U.S. in homage to the American-made wonder that inspired his furniture company.
Does Dickerson really think that votes are cast in a particular case because of the parties, or that judges do research using campaign contribution lists instead of online legal research material? Or that individuals who have worked for decades in the legal system -- and who undoubtedly care about the state of the law -- would cast a vote simply because someone did or did not contribute to a campaign?

In eight years as vice president, Mr. Gore proved to be an effective right-hand man to Mr. Clinton over a range of domestic matters. Mr. Cheney in eight years under Mr. Bush became a powerful voice in the shaping and implementation of foreign policy. And Mr. Biden for nearly four years has been an influential figure for Mr. Obama in both realms, as a former chairman of both the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committees.

Growth opportunities may eventually push the entrepreneurs to seek outside investment. They don't rule that out, but for now they're still in bootstrap mode. When their backlog of business reaches a certain level, they order another machine and hire more staff.
Sekella explained that because certain categories of spending within the school budget are exempt from the calculation of the tax cap, the real tax burden on residents could be more than the cap indicates.

"We have exactly the same position on euro bonds," Sarkozy said. "One day we could imagine them, but at the end of a process of European integration, not at the beginning."
Mr. Teare's attorney, Gerard P. Martin, wrote that it would not be advisable for Mr. Teare, as a law enforcement officer, to provide public testimony on matters that are subject to an impending criminal trial. That is not a courtesy police tend to observe for run-of-the-mill criminal defendants. The Anne Arundel County Police Department, for example, posts daily news releases about those it has arrested for crimes ranging from petty theft to murder, identifying suspects by name and detailing the evidence against them. The only difference is, those suspects are not Mr. Teare's boss, and none of the alleged crimes involve participation by police officers or questions about whether the chief played a role in covering them up.

They both said yes to hiring a city manager because he was supposedly a "water expert" and was paid the exorbitant annual salary of $324,500. Is that ringing a bell in our city? Their excuse for this colossal waste of money was that we got two for the price of one. Really? He did not last too long (one-plus years) because they found out he was not what they had prayed for.

Meanwhile, the owners who had promoted themselves as champions of urban renewal recognized what everyone else knew years earlier: The state Legislature was never going to agree to their demands for $235 million to build a new arena, so they cashed out for $300 million in 2004 — twice the amount they paid for the franchise.
The state Constitution now contains victim-rights language, but there is no mechanism by which victims or their families can enforce those rights before, during or after trials by seeking relief from the courts.

Sage, which is based in Denver and owns or runs about 65 hotels, has been managing the Crowne Plaza for a year. The company will share ownership of the hotel with Optima, an affiliate of a private, global operation involved with oil, gas, telecommunications and manufacturing in eastern Europe. Optima already owns the Penton Media Building, next to the Crowne Plaza; One Cleveland Center; the Huntington Building on Euclid Avenue; and 55 Public Square.

The bar has 140 calories, 5 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein.
If you have to borrow, think "Stafford" first. Federally-backed Stafford loans, available through the schools, are far superior to private student loans. Many strapped families qualify for subsidized Stafford loans – the government pays the interest while the student is in school. The fixed rate is 3.4 percent for this school year, but it jumps to 6.8 percent in July when a temporary interest rate cut authorized by Congress expires. Unsubsidized Staffords charge 6.8 percent.
Because teams have a stranglehold on salary-cap discussions, fans and media often confuse budget constraints with salary-cap restraints.
Weeks after his death, the chimney problem was enough to overwhelm. She couldn't fix it, couldn't drive the seven miles into town and didn't have a neighbor to ask for help. The disability checks she lives off didn't cover the bills for the wall heater she owned but never used.

On the other, the book offers insights into the nature of espionage that still ring true. Spies guard the national interest, ostensibly, and in their behavior, Le Carré argues, we see a nation's character reflected. Is morality a question of the methods that the secret services use, or does the aim justify all? "Good intelligence work is gradual, and rests on a kind of gentleness," Smiley notes, while even this most cerebral of spy stories comes with its measure of blunt violence. Months or years of careful legwork end with swift action, conclusive or bungled. The game of secrets is all the more dangerous if the perfidy is subtle. Undercover work leaves a bad taste in the mouth, even if it's successful, and often it isn't.

Oliver said public employees must pay their "fair share" to avoid further municipal layoffs and cuts to recreational and public health programs.

After 1994’s underrated “A Date With the Smithereens,” the band was jettisoned from RCA Records. Undaunted, the Smithereens continued to make albums, including a re-creation of the Beatles’ American debut. Severo Journacion replaced Mesaros in 2006, and last year’s “2011,” the band’s first album of new material in more than a decade, is a triumph of persistence: Remarkably similar to the music the band was making in the mid-’80s, it still sounds fresh.
There was no admission charge, no bleachers, no concession stand and no game programs. The fieldhouse on the Concordia campus in Clayton is named for the Preachers' longtime coach, the late Eldon "Pete" Pederson. I didn't know Pederson, but I remember him as an imposing figure when I attended Preachers games as a youngster in the late 1950s and early '60s. It was during that era when I was a neighborhood gym rat and got to serve as a ballboy for the St. Louis Hawks during their preseason camp at Concordia.
Gov. Ted Strickland instituted, by executive order in June 2009, the plan for VLTs at the tracks developed by the racing commission -- to save jobs and help balance the budget.

The report details several horrific events in Sciple's military career. He witnessed "a bus full of casualties and a sea of blood gushing out," then buried some of the Iraqi civilians — and dug them up when relatives came looking.

Determined to honor her while they waited for word from New York, the Ryooks held a memorial Mass for Christina on October 13 at St. Clarence Catholic Church in North Olmsted. About 100 of her friends flew in from Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Washington, D.C., and other parts of the country. A former roommate came from Japan. Although it is customary at Korean funerals to tie black ribbons across the top corners of the deceased person's picture, the Ryooks decided to use red, white and blue ribbons instead.
In 2009, then-state representative Tyrone Yates of Cincinnati sponsored House Bill 274, which would have allowed drug addicts to carry syringes from an exchange program for the purpose of preventing disease transmission.

Loyal fans expecting to hear Canada faithfully replicate that gritty version of country might have been disappointed by his new approach. For every country shuffle he and his four-piece band performed, Canada played a bracing rock song.

That material contained an energy that was lacking in country songs like "'The Ballad of Rosalie."

Play Misty for Me (1971): A love letter to the area. Eastwood, who made his directorial debut with "Misty," shot not only the movie's exteriors in Monterey but the interiors as well. The film's premise is that Eastwood's character, a disc jockey for Carmel jazz station KRML (which went silent this year), has a one-nighter with a fan (Jessica Walter) who turns out to be a psycho.

In the Nashville case, plaintiffs argue that the flooding was caused by a botched handling of the Old Hickory Dam upriver. The suit alleges that the federal dam was congressionally authorized not as a flood-control project, but as a hydroelectric power and navigation project.

They interviewed the mothers of 236 children at ages 5, 7 and 10, asking whether the youngsters had been exposed to domestic violence between the mother and her partner; physical maltreatment by an adult; or bullying. Researchers measured the children's telomeres  in cells obtained by swabbing the insides of their cheeks  at ages 5 and 10.
There was no miracle this time, as Dayton won 79-72 at the UD Arena. It's the second straight loss for SLU, both on the road in hostile environments. While this was another close call for SLU, which is 12-3 overall, this one was the first time SLU seemed to have strayed from the fundamentals that had got it off to its strong start.
Early Thursday, Minneapolis officials confirmed that the city's stadium funding plan may fall $55 million short.
The golden goose in this particular goose chase is an old violin recently inherited by an aging and addled Gorvy Hauer (Arkin). The instrument might have value, with an appraiser/restorer (Bob Balaban) trying to track down its pedigree. Mickey finds out about the violin when his newly recruited associate, Bob Egan (an excellent David Harbour), sells Gorvy a homeowner's policy. Bob is a salt-of-the-earth guy so helpful that he persuades Gorvy to put in an alarm system.

Subjects like sexual violence ("The World According to Garp") and abortion ("The Cider House Rules") have been central to his work, and now in his pensive 13th novel, "In One Person," he tackles an equally urgent question: American society's slow, painful effort to comprehend issues of sexuality and gender identity.

To begin with, the National Campaign discovered a considerable discrepancy among those ages 18 to 29 between perceived understanding and actual understanding of how to prevent pregnancy. Of those polled, 90% reported that they know everything they need to know to avoid pregnancy, yet nearly 80% of men and 30% of women in the same group said that they know "little or nothing" about the birth control pill. And 24% of all respondents believe that wearing two condoms provides double protection, when in fact it increases the chance of breakage.
• Frank Isola of the New York Daily News reminds us of how long it's been since the Knicks won a playoff game, let alone a series: "This time of year has been unkind to the Knicks the past 11 years. They still haven’t won a playoff game since April 29, 2001, and will take a 10-game postseason losing streak into Game 1... And now Chandler, their defensive leader, is hurting. He sat out Thursday’s regular-season finale in Charlotte and remained back at the team hotel during Friday’s practice."

It's possible that they weren't the stars, after all. On his show, night after night, my father had promoted the dance show -- and himself.

There are also Grayson's odd connections to Florida Tea Party chairman Fred O'Neal and his Tea Party buddy, Doug Guetzloe. Grayson spent money buying ads on Guetzloe's radio show — a move that would probably be questionable for most anyone, considering the size of Guetzloe's audience (before his show was recently booted off the air, anyway). It becomes even more questionable when you consider Grayson is a liberal and Guetzloe is a self-proclaimed conservative.

The legend gets the glory; the real person works. Morrison has a new novel out, "Home," a brief, poetic story of Frank Money, a traumatized Korean War veteran who returns to the states in the 1950s. Morrison has long used fiction as a private and alternative history, whether the Civil War ("Beloved"), the 1920s ("Jazz") or colonial times ("A Mercy"). With "Home," she wanted to add some truth—about war, about racism—to the standard '50s narrative.

Most notably Colin has introduced the partridge shoot. He originally did this for the benefit of the moor, which is huge—there are seven separate days of shooting available without repeating the same route twice and 70 miles of road. (Some of the buttes date back to 1890.) The Drynachan Valley, once known as the Streens due to the steep and narrow gulley that the river cuts, makes it ideal territory for partridges. The light sandy soil is especially perfect for the Spanish red-legged breed on the property. Like all good ventures, Colin started it as the sort of shoot that he would like to go on himself. "There are shoots where the birds are out of range but ours is really about shooting well, and it makes you shoot well—when you see that first bird and think 'Crikey!' it forces you to raise your game," he says, before laughing and adding, "That applies to me too!" Unlike shooting partridge in Spain, where the birds fly low due to the landscape, here they are much higher. Its success has drawn some of the best shots in Europe, including Spain—quite an accomplishment, considering that country is considered to have the best partridge shoots.

For low-delayers, she said, this persistent difference is not merely a weaker ability to resist impulse; these experiments collectively showed that for low-delayers, the drive to try, eat, buy or acquire alluring things seems to be stronger than it is for high-delayers. That may make them somewhat more vulnerable to addiction and obesity, she acknowledged. But it may also make them the risk-takers, the beauty-seekers and the trail-blazers of the world, while high-delayers knuckle down and gut their way through the tough stuff.

"From last year, it is a big, big step. We did not make it to Super Six last year and the fact that we are second, and from that, was a phenomenal step," said King. "We have grown closer as a team, the program has improved a lot.

These are, hands down, the best fries in the city. What's surprising is that this unheralded bistro will go to such great lengths to make them: The potatoes are peeled, then soaked in saltwater, then sliced (punched, as they say in the business), soaked in more saltwater overnight, rinsed, blanched in oil at 250 degrees, taken out and laid on a mat, then fried in oil at 350 degrees until they are crisp outside and tender inside. In the moment before the fries leave the kitchen, truffle oil and sea salt are added.

One of the best parts of growing my own veg and herbs (go ahead, gardener, pronounce the "h") has been exploring ways to use and preserve them. Much as I love enjoying the summer bounty today, I especially love extending it into the gray months. I became a regular reader of FOODday and of local food blogs, swapping ideas with friends who have bought a membership with a farm to share a season's harvest (which means lots of produce to find uses for) and scouring my old family cookbooks. And I decided early that whatever worked would be shared, so I followed the simple recipe used for the lemon verbena bath salts I enjoyed during last winter's doldrums to make this year's gifts for friends, colleagues and relatives alike. Here are a few of my favorites.

"The Hunger Games" is based on the first book in a young adult trilogy by Suzanne Collins -- although like "Harry Potter," its popularity has long since spread beyond the braces-and-pimples set. And like "Harry Potter," this is a series in which the writer's world is so singular that it requires utmost fidelity in its transition to the big screen -- if only for the continued personal safety of the director and screenwriter.
He blended biographical details, an attack on Obama and the promise of a better future, leaving behind his struggle to reassure conservative voters who have been reluctant to swing behind his candidacy.

Competition between siblings are always going to be a part of growing up. However, if it's turning into something negative and sends out unhealthy vibes between the two of them, talk with their teachers and other family members about keeping a positive outlook regarding each child's accomplishments.

The payoff for Port Blakely is habitat enhancement of the economic kind. It will be exempted from additional logging restrictions for 60 years under the "safe harbor" agreement it negotiated with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the "landowner option plan" it signed with the Washington departments of Natural Resources and Fish and Wildlife.

In the first panel a beer-bellied white man says how much he likes to "look up the flag pole and see a symbol of our Southern heritage hangin' there."

3. Grab a bundle of ones and prepare to stuff a wild pink triangle of a G-string. What's better than queer-friendly strip joints? Beautiful, haunting and historic North Beach has the hungry i (599 Jackson St.), a fairly typical strip joint that is couples- and women-friendly -- with, last time I looked, no silicone in sight; plus, it's where Lenny Bruce performed. The Lusty Lady (1033 Kearny St.) is a very queer-positive, no-booze peep show with hot, smart women who own the joint. But if you want lap dances where you can get drunk (on overpriced swill), you can hit the dyke-friendly Hustler Club next door (1031 Kearny St.) or the women-friendly Gold Club in SoMa (650 Howard St.). San Francisco has one better-known, all-male strip club: Nob Hill Adult Theatre (729 Bush; not to be confused with all-girl Nob Hill Lingerie) is primarily for a gay-male clientele, but it's generally friendly toward women, bois and mixed-gender couples -- they endure bachelorette parties, so they're seasoned enough to appreciate any clientele that is polite, isn't screaming in their faces and tips well. Right now, its marquee boasts a message both frightening and enticing -- something cryptic about "Brazilian nuns."

The charm of this production is not so much in the story it tells as in the way it is told. Tracey Maloney's Vasa Lisa seems a wide-eyed waif at first, but as the play progresses she develops into a steely protagonist more than capable of taking on the villains who surround her. And what a crew of villains they are. Jim Lichtscheidl creates the penultimate evil stepmother, coyly prancing and posturing in red heels and a fright wig. Elise Langer offers an impressively elastic series of facial expressions as the stepsister. Luverne Seifert ranges from comically crass as Vasa Lisa's parent to creepily sinister as the predatory Sir Van Franzen, The Terrible. Scuttling like a spider across the stage, Sally Wingert conjures a Baba Yaga who's every child's worst nightmare of a witch.

The only thing that bothers me are defining the reasons you would go here instead of to a locally owned wine shop like Enotria, AZ Wine or Grapeables. Local wine shops are driven by passion. Passion and knowledge are a huge bonus when you're seeking recommendations. I also find the "knowing factor" a huge persuasion. I like to know, and like, whom I'm doing business with. At case pricing, the smaller stores can often compete on price, and within a day or so they can get anything that's available on the market. So although I think it's a good thing to pass along information on the giants, I also like to point out that there are many more benefits to a retail relationship beyond price.

Insurance will generally cover either type of test if it is prescribed by a physician. But while home sleep tests may mean a smaller bite out of your wallet if you have a co-payment or a high-deductible plan, they're not the best choice for everyone, sleep experts agree. "Home sleep testing should be reserved for people that are at high risk for sleep apnea and who don't have a lot of other illnesses like obesity or heart disease that might alter the sensitivity of the test," says Nancy Collop, director of the Emory Sleep Center in Atlanta and president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

But the longer route and the lower price estimate, which surfaced in news reports over the weekend, are all part of a desperate effort for high-speed rail leaders to save a project that has skyrocketed in both costs -- and critics -- since voters first approved a bullet train four years ago. The most expensive public works project in California history is now tabbed at $68 billion -- still twice what voters were told when they approved the project, but less than the near $100 billion estimates in the most recent plan.

A. Pricing is actually a pretty simple and straight forward thing. Customers will not pay literally a penny more than the true value of the product. And as I have been watching the department stores for the past decade, I have been struck by the extraordinary amount of promotional activity, which to me, didn't feel like it was appropriate for a department store. My instinct was that it wasn't a good thing.
We also took the classic candied yams (really sweet potatoes) and created a healthier alternative with better flavor and texture. Roasted yellow peppers enhance the natural sweetness of mashed sweet potatoes and satisfy the sweet and savory component of the meal. Sweet potatoes are often mislabeled yams; look for the orange-flesh variety.

The appetizers are crowd-pleasers that complement a glass of wine. Like the brie wrapped in a square of puff pastry served with grilled radicchio, blood oranges, toasted almonds and a drizzle of honey. Or the plump and briny Prince Edward Island mussels cooked in a buttery, chardonnay herb broth. Lots of local restaurants serve mussels, but this version is my new favorite.

Holmgren invited issues by hiring a first-time head coach and putting him in charge of the offensive game-planning and play calling.

At its most basic, it's the story of the people's fickle love, and a patrician's discomfort with the rough-and-tumble of pragmatic politics. A dense, thoughtful exploration of themes Shakespeare tackled in plays from "Richard II" to "Julius Caesar," it's a difficult drama with a thoroughly unlikable protagonist at its core.

As archbishop in Armagh, a Northern Ireland town that is the ecclesiastical capital for all of Ireland, Brady serves as the Catholic Church's senior figure on the island.
Bad things are going to happen. Some of them, such as earthquakes, landslides and tornadoes, just don't mean anything. A Lee Harvey Oswald or Timothy McVeigh will occasionally happen. This doesn't mean anything except that, out of several hundred million souls, a few will spontaneously combust under the right conditions. We might be able to reduce our vulnerability, but we can never eliminate it.

"They (the offense) did a better job of managing things early," Kelly said. "They put themselves in a hole the other day, then got themselves out of it but (today) I thought they did a decent job. I think quarterbacks are starting to understand a little bit better that it's about completions, it's not about throwing the ball down the field, not about forcing the situation.

Salt cod is pretty affordable, but it does need to be soaked ahead of time, sometimes for a day. That didn't sound so appealing to me, so instead I made the brandade with sauteed artichokes, a time-honored Bay Area celebratory food. OK, they also take some time to prepare, but the brandade is gooey and warm, an urbane version of that artichoke dip that everyone loves but that can be a little declassé.
Always be aware and ready: Too many of us blithely believe that we are mostly pretty safe, even when we're out at night (even I got complacent again years after my attacks). Worse, when our intuition kicks in to warn us, we try to talk ourselves out of it, because we want to be nice, polite and not overly suspicious.

Having an official, detailed record of a loan may minimize a traditional conflict which often arises in divorce cases where a parent has extended a loan to the child and his or her spouse.

Molly Gamache, a former housekeeper in Natick, Mass., told me that her supervisors required her to count the number of toothbrushes in the bathroom.

You have to see a doctor about the swelling. A large number of conditions can bring it on. Some are dangerous, such as heart failure. Some are less significant, but the only way you'll find out is through a doctor's exam. You need to see the doctor about the stasis dermatitis, too. An ulcer can form on the involved skin. It's very hard to cure once it forms.

It seems to me that a great deal of banning is like chasing needles in haystacks, take Foie Gras for instance, it affects a fraction of a percentage of birds. And is debatable at best as to their treatment here in California. Meanwhile we have an industrial food system raising chickens, pigs and cattle in simply atrocious conditions. That's the elephant in the room, and why isn't that banned? Corporate greed and lobbying. So then you just go and beat up the little guy instead.
From the beginning, Mayfield's story was one of striving against adversity - though he refused to view his life with self-pity. He was born in 1942 in Chicago and grew up in that city's ghettos. It was here that Mayfield was exposed to the gospel music that forever flavored his songs. His first performing experience came in his church choir, where he met singer Jerry Butler, with whom he formed the Roosters in 1956.

One problem with all this, though: The same thing that happened to college basketball is happening to college hockey. It's been that way for a few years — players are staying only a year or two before signing with the pros.
