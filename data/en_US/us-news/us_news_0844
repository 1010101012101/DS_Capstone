Small businesses that cater to Latinos in Mesa reported a drop in business following Sheriff Joe Arpaio's immigration sweep. A lot of people stayed off the streets. Were they all illegal immigrants?

Economists have found a strong link between consumption, credit booms and falling real-estate prices: Countries that experienced a sharp rise in household debt will experience a sharper fall in consumption after a housing bust than nations where debt hasn't risen as fast. If you borrowed a lot of money to buy your house (and the land it rests on), and then prices fall soon afterwards, you are more likely to want to repay the debt than go out to dinner, buy a new car or renovate your house.

Color splash: "I have a very clean design point of view, but something I always love to integrate is a splash of color in unexpected places. Maybe all of the trim is navy blue, the ceiling is painted a wild color, or wallpaper is applied on just an accent wall or on the ceiling. A new product that I used in my Showcase room is a perfect example: Timothy Sue's Hearts Apart in chartreuse is a colorful pattern on the ceiling that is completely unexpected and easily removable."

Rob Rang, NFLDraftScout.com: B-minus. “The Ravens deftly moved out of the first round after realizing one of the players they were targeting was going to slip into the second. Having lost outside linebacker Jarret Johnson to the Chargers though free agency and unable to wait any longer for former second-round pick Sergio Kindle to return to his playmaking ways, the Ravens nabbed one of the safest pass rushing OLBs in the draft in Courtney Upshaw at No. 35 overall. Upshaw will erase any doubts about his ability to transition from Alabama to the NFL when he makes an immediate impact for Baltimore. Four-year starter Kelechi Osemele won't be asked to remain at left tackle in the NFL as he played for Iowa State but move either to the right or compete with second-year pro Jah Reid to take over for another free agent defection Ben Grubbs (Saints) at left guard. Of the Ravens' later picks, watch out for Temple running back Bernard Pierce and Cal-Poly cornerback Asa Jackson to emerge as strong contributors in backup roles.”

The kid gunslinger did not need to be spectacular in his third NFL start, but he needed to keep mistakes to a minimum and make some plays. Check and check. McCoy was 14-of-19 for 174 yards and stayed interception- and sack-free. McCoy's best play occurred on third-and-4 from the New England 17 with 4:16 left in the second quarter. He managed to slip away from a blitzing defensive back, escaped the pocket to the right, avoided another potential tackler and threw on the run into a football-sized window.

Regardless of how many Verizon iPhones are sold in the months ahead, the multibillion dollar mobile application industry that Apple introduced to the world only three years ago (and that Google has expanded with its own impressive array of Android-powered devices) will only grow.

KSDK has now preempted two of the three vote-outs on "I'm a Celebrity" -- not because this isn't a very good show but because paid programming is a money-maker. Fine; economic times are tough, but use some judgment and bump a rerun, not a serialized competition with audience-participation elements and hard-to-avoid spoilers.
After Juan Uribe struck out, Cox opted for Lowe to walk Pablo Sandoval intentionally -- even though the impatient hitter swung at two pitches out of the zone while striking out in his first at-bat.

How does that compare to the city's contributing 23.9 percent of pay? And what do the firemen contribute? And let's not get into what the pay rates are, years required for retirement eligibility, unlimited accrual of vacation and sick pay and retirement health benefits. Without question, this is a taxpayer issue that Mayor Annise Parker should be putting on the table with a very bright light on for all city taxpayers to see.
Lou Brock could swipe second base.
For every night it seems like there's nothing on but "Hoarders," "The Real Hoardin' Housewives" or "Hillbilly Handfishin' Hoarders," there are nights like Sunday. Tonight brings more worthy shows than my DVR can handle, including the Season 2 premieres of "Game of Thrones" and "The Killing"; the "Masterpiece Classic" version of "Great Expectations"; Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s "Finding Your Roots"; Discovery's "Frozen Planet"; and a new episode of "Mad Men." Any other week, there would also be "The Good Wife," but Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) finally gets a night off, courtesy of the "Academy of Country Music Awards."

That may be a whole lotta cash, but what's worse is spending money on a product that doesn't deliver on its promise.
Seems like a relatively normal guy. Highly likable, which sounds like an awful thing to say about a rock star, but isn't.

Known in English as breadfruit, the ulu entranced Captain Cook when Tahitians introduced him to its starchy produce. The fruit is traditionally eaten steamed or cooked in an imu (underground oven), Zane noted, but ulu is more than just food: "The iconic leaf (is) a symbol of Polynesia … and a metaphor, 'to grow.' It's a very meaningful plant to give to a child on his first birthday."

Westbrook takes a 2-1 record and a 1.31 ERA into his start tonight at Busch Stadium against Milwaukee as the Cardinals open a six-game home stand. His start is good, but it isn't enough to lead his own rotation in wins or ERA. Youngster Lance Lynn woke up Thursday after his victory at Wrigley Field as the only starter in the majors with four wins, and opening-day starter Kyle Lohse is second in the National League with a 0.99 ERA.
"I had to work through the fear of getting hurt again,'' he said. "On top of that, between being redshirted and missing half of last season with the injury, I was away from competition for a long time.

I feel 100 percent, mentally and physically, and I'm really looking forward to my first trip to the NCAAs.

One fast-food spot is tolerable. Two is terrible. Having all three is unnecessary and just plain wrong. It's actually four if you count the Green Burrito that will share the Carl's Jr. location.
Smith said she wants to retain and expand the strategies that are working in small schools. It's possible that small schools such as Renaissance Arts or Pursuit of Wellness at Roosevelt could be reborn as an arts or health-focused small school. But the focus of small schools right now isn't to train students to be studio artists, vocalists or even doctors. Small schools advocates say they use the career paths as one way to draw students in and keep their interest while preparing them for high school graduation and college.

With the throne at stake, lives hang in the balance. There is some brutality in the book, which is both age- and era-appropriate but may be off-putting to some parents. At one point, Sage is sent to the dungeon, where he's mercilessly whipped. He is also stabbed. At least two characters die bloodily, though the details are fairly bland. Likewise, the interactions Sage has with the novel's two female characters carry only the slightest whiff of romance.

Campaigning in Philadelphia, Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney ridiculed the Buffett rule, telling a tea party audience in Philadelphia the revenue it would produce would fund the government for only about 11 hours.

Harrison jokes that he's the "world's most infamous pap" -- a reference to a 1998 incident involving Schwarzenegger that partially prompted California's initial effort to reign in the paparazzi.

The trend, according to homeless advocates, is partly the result of strict enforcement programs instituted in other areas like Venice, and an economy that continues to struggle.

Chipper? Look, there’s no escaping this: He killed the Mets his whole career. He named his kid Shea. He broke more hearts and spirits than any other opponent. You know who else did that to a New York team generations ago? Stan Musial. You know who gave Musial his nickname, “The Man?” Dodgers fans who saw him pound the Bums day after day and grew to admire him even as he destroyed them. And late in the 1962 season, the Mets, New York’s National League heirs, gave Musial a full-blown “day” at the Polo Grounds.

The Sharks are running out of opportunities. And that's got to be daunting, even demoralizing.

But nowhere was Greer's version of "inclusion" better on display than at the past Republican National Convention. That was where Florida sported one of the least diverse delegations in modern history — and the country. Out of 114 delegates, three were black. There were also so few women that on "Ladies Night" at the convention — an evening meant to show support for Sarah Palin by asking all the female delegates to sit up front — Florida's delegation didn't even have enough to fill the seats. They had to recruit non-delegate seat-fillers to help out.

He grew up in Lakewood in the 1960s. His mother was a nurse. His father worked for the East Ohio Gas Co. McCafferty fondly recalls scraping together neighborhood pickup games.
I pity Sabourin. How can you blame her for being so smitten with the large and tasty dish of Hollywood handsome that she allegedly followed him from Montreal to New York, just to get close?
A Newark landmark. The blue — and white — collar gathering place downtown. Cops, firemen, city officials and workers, they’re all here. Irish/workingman’s bar where you can get a good Guinness pour. Jukebox with contemporary and classic rock. Play the Stones’ "Can’t You Hear Me Knocking" and rock on out.
Fitch said he believes Charlack's camera has reduced speeders but doubts it matters much beyond the city limit.
But there was no need for a "flip of the switch" as the GOP campaign ended, because the Obama operation had already been long-engaged in the fight.
Building a database to connect patient care among doctors, all caregivers and the patients themselves via computer. This could produce greater accountability in patient care and prevent hospital re-admittance.
Here's betting that negative parental actions, including behavior at games, know no boundaries.
As Jennifer deteriorates, though, the amusing or thought-provoking moments give way to an atmosphere of constant fear — fear for Jennifer, and sometimes fear of her. It emerges that her longtime best friend and neighbor Amanda has been murdered and the fingers removed from one of her hands. The grisly, apparently pointless operation happened to be Jennifer's surgical specialty. Periodic visits from the police punctuate Jennifer's accelerating decline. As she becomes increasingly childlike, they become more brutal in their questioning. The answer to the mystery seems to be locked away in one of the shutdown parts of Jennifer's mind, out of her reach and the reader's.

Reynolds met with manager Buck Showalter two weeks ago and told him he would be willing to play anywhere in order to help the team. Reynolds played 44 games at first last year, making just five errors with a .987 fielding percentage.
In a studio lined with tattered Oriental rugs, the indefatigable radio-show team— a heavily Russian-accented host (Joe Curnutte), a geeky technician (Marc Bovino), a sultry female performer (Stephanie Wright Thompson) and the wonderfully named guitarist Alexei “Tumbleweed” Petrovya (Michael Dalto) — make their best effort at putting on their show, despite many difficulties.
With so many tickets sold in advance of the release of "The Hunger Games," reviews may be beside the point. With millions of readers already drawn into Suzanne Collins' trilogy about the post-apocalyptic world of Panem, the way has been paved for a successful release. Add to that a huge publicity storm -- I think the star, Jennifer Lawrence, has been on the cover of every magazine except "Muscle and Fitness" -- and you're looking at record ticket sales.
Rodgers earned 48 votes to two for New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees in balloting by a nationwide panel of 50 media members who regularly cover the NFL. The Packers star is the first Green Bay player honored since Brett Favre concluded a run of three straight seasons as MVP in 1997.

Kevin Carey, policy director at Education Sector, another Washington, D.C. think tank, disagreed, saying Smarick’s level of experience is not a negative.
However, with the economy showing some signs of resuscitation, in November Mr. Romney or any other nominee will likely need a more persuasive argument to voters than simply being the non-Obama. Banking on worse times is no worthy formula, either, for returning a Republican to the White House.

"This is not about medical marijuana, it's about whether we're going to have an AG who picks and chooses which laws they're going to enforce," Holton said. "She's made it very clear that she does not think there are resources to enforce marijuana laws. It's entirely inappropriate. It invites lawbreaking."
The most recent restaurant to make locavore waves on Kaua'i opened in July in the former Gaylord's at Kilohana Plantation. Called 22 North, after the Garden Island's latitude, the new incarnation may not have an ocean view, but it does overlook the source of much of its produce. According to co-owner Todd Oldham, about 50 percent of the restaurant's produce comes from Kilohana Plantation itself, 70 acres of which are in agricultural production — everything from pineapple and papaya to less common crops such as melon, zucchini, tomatoes, peanuts and okra. To create the seasonal bar menu, which includes locally made beer, rum and mead, among other alcoholic beverages, Oldham brought a mixologist from O'ahu to walk through the orchards, inspiring cocktails with exotic ingredients such as lavender, sapote and cashew fruit.
But, sadly, in much of the high-end ranks of college athletics, there's a deep cynicism and an even deeper commercialism that now taint a cherished game.
"I have a strong feeling that the movement I have been enjoying so much is skidding," said Nikita Grishin, a curly-haired 18-year-old physics student at Moscow University. "I think people are simply in despair, as none of our demands have been met and Putin doesn't seem to care about what we think and what we say here."

Bochy, the manager, kept pushing the right buttons but never gloating. And refreshingly, throughout the process, you never heard anybody utter the traditionally lame clichés of false sports victimhood -- "Nobody believed in us" or "We showed the doubters." Instead, you got answers such as this one from Wilson when he was asked why his beard was so unnaturally black: "I don't know what you're talking about -- it's dark because we play a lot of day games. It's tanned. It's focused."
“As long as he wants to pursue this, we will be supporting him,” said Kreep, executive director of the United States Justice Foundation, an advocacy group.
"I wanted a beautiful contrast between black and white," Thoms said. "The painting says, 'Think!' This painting has more meaning than just those two people.

Roughly $150,000 was returned to local business owners that took advantage of the program in 2009. City officials are hoping to again be recognized as the top community in the county to receive funds.
The National Federation of High School Associations (NFHS), however, has modified softball in a significant way. Rule 1-1-2b made it optional for state associations to change the distance from the pitching rubber to home plate from 40 to 43 feet. The change was optional in 2010 but becomes mandatory for all states in 2011.
It was the deadliest incident along the volatile border since Israel fought Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas during a monthlong war five years ago.
The culinary center includes 24 stations - each with cooktops, cookware, sinks and drawers - and participants work in two-person teams. Video screens help students follow directions, and staffers roam the premises offering advice. Tips cover familiar ingredients ("When you work with fresh pasta, the pasta is the star; when you work with dry pasta, the sauce is the star," Kelly says) and encourage healthy dining.

This is the third time this year that the horses have raced each other, but it is the second time they have finished 1-2. They last met in July at the Grade I Man ‘o War Stakes at Belmont Park, where the 4-year-old Cape Blanco narrowly beat a hard charging Gio Ponti. It seemed a bit similar to the two horses' finish at the Million.
"That was the discussion. Before Kendal was chosen (we asked) 'how are we going to do this' and we talked about it for weeks prior to the draft. If we're willing to take the quarterback at 37, if that's what we thought that we could do because you never know some other team could pop up there and get him and Tannehill had already gone, I said if we're going to take him let's just take him. I didn't pound the table. Pat and Tom and I, we had talked about this so much before the draft that it was not a difficult thing to do and we love the quarterback so we just went ahead and did it."
La Nina, which has held sway since last fall, will be officially declared a goner Thursday, an official at the Climate Prediction Center in Maryland told InsideClimate News. And while nobody is quite certain what will happen next, some long-range forecast models are pointing to the possible emergence of the opposite phenomenon: El Nino.

Dimora's favorite dining spots included Delmonico's, Lockkeepers and Shula's Steak II, all located near his home in Independence. The dinner bills typically were picked up by a sponsor -- a special invitee, usually a contractor looking to ingratiate himself to the commissioner. In exchange, Dimora repaid the sponsors with government contracts, grants and loans, jobs and pay raises.
Governors, the highest-ranking executives whose budgets actually have to balance, have figured it out. In the race for fiscal sanity, they're going to have to set the pace. And some Republican governors are doing their part to focus taxpayers on the political and fiscal liabilities that public employee unions pose.
But even as Ben Wallace approaches the final laps of his career, advancing time hasn't changed some things.

Many of these 80,000- to 100,000-square-foot buildings were not located in power strips but scattered in less dense retail areas. So their fate has been more varied and localized.
His walk rate is higher than it was before surgery so I think we can see a pretty distinct pattern here. Wainwright's pitches aren't going where he wants them to.
Six young battle round contestants on "The Voice" would also crash and burn on Monday, March 26, but not before a few of them demonstrated the same pop stupidity evidenced above -- a lack of basic knowledge that a single afternoon of watching VH1 Classics could have alleviated.

For most airline passengers, none of this really matters. For them, it's an issue of fairness. If you see a $29 ticket to Las Vegas advertised on a billboard, shouldn't you be able to buy that ticket for $29? And that's a question that neither the proposed bill nor some airlines' creative parsing has answered.
Speaking to Samuelsson, though, one senses he'd consider it a shame if Red Rooster were the end of the story, rather than a beginning.
The tyranny of the clock does not rule in trail and ultramarathons. Each course is different and exceedingly more vertical and technical than a road course. Hydration and fueling is much more crucial, too, and pure speed, while still important, is only one of many factors determining the outcome  hill climbing, acumen on descents and overall endurance among them.
With only one seating a night, the pace is leisurely, even if the surroundings are frenetic. After allowing from 30 minutes to an hour to get settled and order the first round of drinks, the first course arrives. One night it was two intertwined prawns on a bed of shredded lettuce and a blanket of chile sauce. Other nights, Jerry McGinnis, who was the chef at Jianna in North Beach before opening Supperclub, prepared smoked trout on a latke, which would have been better if the grated potatoes were at least served close to room temperature; another night he featured his own rendition of tuna salad nicoise.

In his resume, Rafferty writes he has 35 years experience in road, drainage and bridge construction, as well as maintenance and repair. He has previously served as Cumberland County engineer and Atlantic County Director of Public Works.
The Bloomberg administration (of Mayor Mike Bloomberg) in New York is a model for everyone to see. Their design excellence programs, development incentives, the way they have worked to elevate the conversation of architecture from libraries in Queens to parks systems -- I would say the greatest successes in New York City have been a result of that administration.
Lee Seale, corrections deputy chief of staff, called that record "a departmental success story."
Thomas invariably had his choice of open receivers, and enough time to consider his options.
The report from the NVCA offers several more compelling answers. For instance, the report notes the disappearance of many of the boutique investment banks that championed the technology industry in the 1990s and offers way to encourage the creation of new ones. (Opportunity alert for all you unemployed investment bankers!) The report also notes that startups employ the largest and most expensive accounting firms. The NVCA plans to engage these big firms in rethinking their high fee structures for small companies while also pushing startups to consider smaller, competitive accountants.
In Illinois, 17 of the 102 counties do not have township government. Their citizens seem to do just fine.
How about Ruby, who has been in her new home for several months already? Jeff recently bought her a crate and has been going through the process of getting her used to it. She's still fairly new to living with him, so my guess is that, if he sticks with the program, it's going to take around a month to break her bad habits and replace them with good ones.

Shame that some people have to hate others to feel good about themselves. Dan Rodricks' recent column on immigrants ("Illegal immigrants: We detest them — and need them," June 30) has raised a good point.
Even if Maurice has already eaten, she will gather her friends and walk over to his dimly lit shop, which doubles as his bedroom.
Then Mary Lou was diagnosed with cancer. Al still gets choked up talking about the night he sat down with his wife and Mary Lou to discuss him taking over her beloved nursery. Mary Lou told Al that he had to work it full-time. Al was an automotive supervisor with the LAPD. He couldn't afford to give up the benefits and pension, he told her, he could only do it part-time.

A mile or so into the rain forest, we arrive at the station, where orangutan moms and babies are sitting calmly on a wooden platform, feasting on piles of blackish bananas and milk. Less social apes slide down from the trees and grab a handful of fruit before heading back up into the canopy.
Hi Lisa,
Let the record show I'm wearing jeans as I write this. It's Wednesday. Not that it matters now that casual Friday has morphed into casual every day.
There's one other possibility, and you'll need a dermatologist's eye to be sure: milia, tiny cysts that contain keratin, a skin protein. Anyone can get milia, even babies, and they're almost always benign. Using a sterile needle, your doc can prick the bump and coax out what's inside. (Don't try this yourself.) If your milia stage more comebacks than Britney Spears, your dermatologist may prescribe topical retinoids or treatments.
The lawyer stressed previous revelations that talks between Constellation and Exelon had begun at around the same time that the Baltimore company and EDF were trying to resolve a dispute over developing a third nuclear unit at Calvert Cliffs in Southern Maryland.
Oregon's largest school district, Portland Public Schools, improved its results by 5 percentage points, a huge one-year increase. But its on-time graduation rate, 59 percent, remains one of the worst in the state and far behind those of districts with similar poverty levels.
"I think that's one of the legacies David definitely leaves," said Dave Nielsen, chief executive of Home Builders Association Metro Portland. "No matter what philosophical bent other entities had, he really did work to reach out to people. He did as good a job as he could to hear different voices."
"Yep – it's more of a battle now," Hunter said. "You look at the last two years – how would they have done if you took away their best hitter? We lost our best hitter for two years (Morales). Now, we've got him back – and we added this guy."
"Real close," he said.

Beyond the history lessons they tell, they include dramatic views, serious weaponry, historic hardware and architecture, bike paths, playgrounds and, yes, ballet lessons.
Federal prosecutors contend she spent the funds on jewelry and cars, including a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette Roadster, as well as horses. The breed, known as quarter horses, is prized for being able to run short straightaways faster than any other. The best sell for $200,000.
He wasn't always artful. His words sometimes came back to hurt him. But when it comes to crime in the city, being genteel isn't always the best strategy. When it comes to addressing fundamental problems in the police department, after years of scandal and trouble, being too cautious with your words can lead to yet more complacency. When it comes to making a community safer, you need the type of urgency and frustration Straub often exhibited.
Shipments of the companys auto-dimming mirror unit shipments increased 16 percent and included an 18 percent increase in North American shipments stemming from a double-digit increase in domestic vehicle production.

The Nuggets now have a lot of great defenders, including JaVale McGee and Wilson Chandler, and yet in their first three games with the new players, the team allowed 117.7 PPG. It looks like whoever the team has, their defense hasn't improved. Can this team ever get better on the defensive end so that they can finally be a playoff threat?
The award, one of two presented this year in the St. Louis area, went to Capt. Jeff Joyce and Capt. Larry LeMaster of the Firefighters Local 253 of Granite City Relief and Welfare Fund.

If you have a strong religious opposition to vaccination, or it is proven that your child would medically be harmed by a vaccine, you can opt out. In some states -- California and Washington, for instance -- there is also a "philosophical exemption" that allows the children of Google-educated worriers into school without shots.
The Occupy movement is never identified by name in the affidavit filed by federal officials today, but interviews have since indicated that the five arrested had been involved with – and somewhat dissatisfied with – the Occupy Cleveland movement in Public Square.
"Football is a great, outstanding thing, but it's just a stepping stone," he explained to the students, stressing that nothing beats receiving a good education.

Well, I can't remember any good economic times associated with high gas prices. Quite the reverse has been the norm. Low energy prices normally are a prime mover in American prosperity.
"There is no dispute that every studio … was aware of his true and legal name," Judge Elden Fox said, throwing out the sole charge against Jason James Murphy.
It is disheartening to read Dan Rodricks prejudiced column ("Pit bulls: Own them at your own risk," May 1). Mr. Rodricks' shoddy research helps perpetuate the misinformation that slanders this dog breed, leading to bad legislation that responsible dog owners must contend with. I hardly think that a person who is scared to be within four feet of an animal is qualified to pass any judgement on the temperament of that animal. Clearly Mr. Rodricks' opinions consist of the litany of oft cited myths about the dangers of pit bulls. Please allow me to correct some of the inaccuracies with Mr. Rodricks' article.
In fact, Mr. Carey never tired of speaking of James Carey, his great-great-grandfather, former chairman of the Bank of Maryland and a relative of Johns Hopkins. He reminded listeners that his grandmother, Anne Galbraith Carey, had created the Gilman School for Boys in Roland Park in 1897.
Several other sites in the state are named for the governor, including Hunt Canyon in Cochise County.
That focus on social issues made Dennis Wright, 60, of Livonia, a little uncomfortable. He asked Santorum what he would do with Social Security and heard only that Santorum wants to raise the eligibility age for the benefit, without adequate detail.

"America has overcome all these prejudices we had. We're not nearly as gender-biased as we used to be. We're not nearly as racist as we used to be. We're not as anti-gay as we used to be. The only bigotry we've got left is: We don't want to be around anybody who disagrees with us," he told a crowd gathered at Chase Bank in Chicago for last week's "Ideas Week" conference.

The feeling seems to be mutual.
Then there's former Washington Post staffer Jane Black, writing on TheAtlantic.com, who brings up a pervasive and troubling branding trend in food: virtue, as seen in the National Pork Board’s new slogan, “Be Inspired.” This squishy new slogan says virtually nothing about the pork itself, and that's the idea. Black says it's a neat way of dodging the fact that all kinds of eaters are questioning how their meat is produced and whether they want to eat it at all.
McCafferty, who is leading the transition group, says his team tried to find a properly sized, centrally located site that would provide at least a temporary meeting base for the new council. Even if the council holds some of its sessions elsewhere around the county, he figures it will need an anchor location to avoid public confusion.
A DNA test appeared to confirm that Fossen, a Happy Valley resident, had been at the scene. The genetic material was on file because samples were taken after a woman identified as Fossen was arrested for similar crimes in Florida and Nevada.

I haven't decided whether to put a burger on the menu, but if I do, it will have to be great and fit the small plate focus. I'm not sure about desserts, since I haven't hired a pastry chef yet. The plan is to have wine in different-size measured pours. Diners can bring their own wine, too, and corkage will be set at around $20.
"New York City is always a hate-love relationship," Gilyeat says. "You can ask anyone who has lived there, unless they were born and raised there. You have to find your niche within the community. Luckily, doing so much theater, you have such a huge community to go back to. But I'm still a West Coast boy. I miss it."

At issue is how juries should factor the harm to outside parties when
“Knock it down, knock it down, knock it down,” linebacker Mathias Kiwanuka said he was thinking as the pass descended in the end zone. “That’s something we’ve gone over. We’ve seen guys go up and try to get the interception and the game ends horribly for them. We had everybody in position, and we knew what we had to do.”
"I had a comfort zone with them and with my family, that it could be my home away from home. It was not only just with the football players, but with the fans and the students," Cox said.

Reid's plan does not include new tax revenue, as Obama has demanded. But unlike the GOP plan, it would extend the debt ceiling into 2013 -- an Obama ultimatum. The House plan trims about $1.2 tillion but would only extend the debt ceiling for less than a year.
That helps explain why, in the midst of the worst housing downturn since the Great Depression, several Twin Cities real estate companies made the list of best workplaces in Minnesota: Keller Williams Realty ranked No. 1 among large companies for a second consecutive year.

Celebrations also are planned for New Orleans, Norfolk, Va., New York and Boston, among other port cities. Fort McHenry will play a key role in Baltimore's lineup, planners say, because it's associated with a turning point in the war against the British.

Sometimes it's comforting to look back. The vaudeville era evoked in "Just a Song at Twilight" (West End Players Guild) promises old-fashioned pleasures; so does the comedy and music revue "A La Carte" (Black Cat Theatre). Or how about the comics-colored future of "The Intergalactic Nemesis" (Ovations). But life is always more complicated than we remember or hope. Just ask the gender-bent heroine of "Victor/Victoria" (Stages St. Louis).

In June, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce's chairmen said it was BP that made five crucial decisions before the Deepwater Horizon well blowout that "posed a trade-off between cost and well safety." One of those decisions: BP opted against conducting a certain kind of test of the integrity of a cement job at the well.

I took several photos on the T-Mobile One S and then captured the same photo on the iPhone 4S—the gold standard for smartphone cameras. Though the iPhone did a bit better in a couple of photos, like capturing more detail in the foreground of a sunset, I was drawn to the colors and quality captured on the HTC One. After a week, I found myself reaching for it more than the iPhone.

But by the time Marley - "the youngest and hottest vice president in advertising" - is told she has late-stage colon cancer, that innocuous opening seems almost forgivable. Now Marley has fallen in love with her doctor, played with a lost look and a lab coat by Gael Garcia Bernal. And he's fallen for her jokes about rectal thermometers. This is not only inadvisible, it's unethical.
First-choice lineups – There are too many lineup sheets around MLS that look like what you’d see with five weeks to go in the season, not five weeks in. But a lot of clubs already are being forced to test their depth. The Galaxy welcomed back Landon Donovan (quadriceps) over the weekend, only to see David Beckham miss the loss to SKC with back spasms. The absence of central defenders Omar Gonzalez (knee) and Leonardo (knee) continues to hurt.

It's a gratifying way to see old friends I used to work with. It's an excuse to catch up on old times. Obviously, I've visited my parents over the years, but I've had a couple of the most amazing trips having to do with the recent awards, where I've seen people from my professional past and it felt so good, I could hold my head up high. It was the kind of thing I had never dreamt for myself, ever. I had long ago decided that my life had taken this irrevocable path away from that world. And I don't really miss it, but I miss a lot of the people in it. And it's nice to see them again.

The future first lady was born in Ely, Nev., in 1912 and grew up — quickly — in Artesia. At age 13, she lost her mother, which meant added responsibilities at home; five years later, her father died. She and her siblings juggled work and school, but when the opportunity presented itself, she took a road trip to New York City and stayed, working as a secretary and, improbably, as an X-ray technician.
As the name implies, a fire is always roaring somewhere at the similarly consistent Forge in the Forest in Carmel, just far enough from the throngs on Ocean Avenue that we could nab a parking space nearby on our last lunchtime visit. A blacksmith operated here at Junipero and Fifth, starting in 1944, but by the 1970s the site had turned into first an art studio and later a tavern. The actual anvil, vise and hearth used in its smithy days are on view in the restaurant's Forge Saloon, but we usually opt to eat outside on one of two patios warmed by fire pits and heat lamps when needed (on sunny fall days, the shade umbrellas are also handy.) The outdoor dining areas are also open to dogs, whose owners can order from a special "dog pound" menu. Non-canines can choose from an even broader selection, with local flavors including a grilled Castroville artichoke ($10.50) and a fried panko-crusted sand dab sandwich ($12.50).
Who doesn't want flawless skin with pores that are barely visible? It's no surprise that there are countless products with "pore-shrinking" claims on store shelves. When the GHRI Beauty Lab tested pore minimizers in the past, we found they didn't live up to their claims. But since it's been a number of years since our last look at them and there are lots of new ones on the market, the Beauty Lab decided to reevaluate, focusing on products that claim to instantly (and also, just temporarily) reduce pore size.

The investigators are not as rigid concerning a year or two difference in age. They believe age is more of a concern for the team interested in signing the player. The Indians follow MLB's investigation with one of their own on every Latin American player they sign. They avoid players labeled "inconclusive" and administer steroid tests to every player they sign. It is not a fool-proof system.

In a note to clients, Sterne Agee analyst Ben Elias cut his rating on the stock to "Neutral" from "Buy," because of slowing growth in its core business and lower global growth predictions.

Field has sold more than three million tickets in each of the past eight seasons, the ballpark, like Fenway, still ranks in baseball's lower third in terms of seating capacity. And baseball's second-oldest ballpark is also in need of massive renovation, as illustrated by the team's repeated attempts to secure state funds for a project that could cost a reported $350-400 million.

"Yes, 'The Sopranos' gets a lot of credit for inspiring the quality shows of today," Bianculli said. "Once 'The Sopranos' succeeded in driving the discussion, TV let its imitative bones take it where it wanted to go, so we now have more anti-heroes than we have pro-heroes. Television was constrained from doing this for so long, that once something breaks the barrier and shows it can work, it encourages all these other writer-producers. This is the good part of imitation. It encourages people to try bold things."
