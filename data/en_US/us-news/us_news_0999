“One of the key things to keeping a healthy lifestyle is laughter,” she said.
"He is very sad about what has happened to his college career and Ohio State," Rosenhaus said. "I can tell you that he is extremely, he is responsible for the mistakes that he has made. He has owned up to that. There are no excuses here, guys. No excuses at all. But the past is now the past for him and we have to move ahead. There is no point in him looking back."

The paper's critic found that "the one vice of his previous novels was a certain dense ambiguity, a dreaminess that, done well, made for shimmering layers of story ("Remembering Babylon") and done too much made for lyrical confusion ("The Conversations at Curlew Creek")." With "Ransom," however, Malouf succeeds "with a wonderful grace and simplicity" that "boasts all of Malouf's capacious talents for imagination, for grace of line and image (he has written seven books of poetry), and for lean and piercing storytelling."

Consider giving a gift to anyone who provides you service throughout the year if you feel the two of you have established a relationship: the landscaper who visits monthly, a housekeeper who cleans weekly, the pool guy who visits regularly, your on-call handyman.

Beer is rightfully getting the same respect as wine these days. It's an endlessly fascinating beverage, and its beauty is that it can be made almost anywhere if you have the right ingredients.

"I'm in hell now," she replied, and took a bus 75 miles to Rochester, N.Y., to obtain contraceptives. My parents had no more children. My mother made certain her four daughters had no qualms about using birth control. Still, I wonder whether having such a large family so quickly contributed to her death in her 50s.
The 5:1 match is far greater than the typical private sector benefit. A 2011 survey of 401k plans by Deloitte Consulting LLP, showed the most common employer match is 50 cents for every dollar the employee contributes, up to 6% of earnings. That makes Wayne Countys match 10 times higher than typical private sector plans.
"We're just a little spot across the street from Pok Pok," he says. "Some people, just when they find out they have a 45-minute to an hour wait there, they say, 'Oh, I'm hungry, and hey there's this Thai place across the street that sells pad Thai.'"
A: These wonderful things I couldn't have foreseen keep happening to me. The Marsh seems to bring us together, like my working with Dan (Hoyle) and now this crazy idea that three people can write a play together. And I do think the sum is greater than its parts.

It's a good idea, Berea.
Addressing access to dental care will not only help to relieve pain and improve health for millions, but it will save money, too. The Pew Center on the States recently released a report that said that there were 830,000 visits to emergency rooms across the country for preventable dental conditions in 2009, a 16 percent increase from 2006. Emergency room care is extremely expensive. Access to dental care can cut back on these visits and save significant sums of money.

KEEPING the blues fresh in the digital age is no picnic. This young trio at least cooks up riffs authentically ragged, raw and Dixie-fried on its latest album (due Tuesday). Two of these players are the progeny of Muscle Shoals vet Jim Dickinson (who returns as producer) and it shows. Singer-guitarist Luther Dickinson fires up a solo of wild jazzbo on "Soldier," and later wails a sad lament: "I'd love to be a hippie, but my hair won't grow that long . . . " The chooglin' is breezier on "Mizzip," another righteous salute to bona fide southern rock 'n' blues. --Steve Appleford
Regardless of price, Americans seem to enjoy the amber liquid, from the Beverly Hills Hotel, where patrons sip Remy Martin sidecars, to midtown Manhattan's Brasserie Cognac, which features nearly 100 varieties.

We conducted our own scouting mission and agreed that McCormick & Kuleto's seafood house in Ghirardelli Square is a solid candidate. Note the restaurant is part of the Portland-based McCormick & Schmick's nationwide chain, which includes a unit in Sacramento and  here's a surprise  the formerly legendary Spenger's Fresh Fish Grotto in Berkeley (1926 to 1998). It was absorbed in 2000 by M&S, which wisely decided to keep the Spenger's name.

After being mostly bashed during 3½ hours of testimony, the council looked pasty and shocked as it filed off the dais.

It's a rare restaurant that could coax me out of my winter den to drive enthusiastically across town for . . . a bowl of soup. That's the power of Michaelangelo's. For all of Michaelangelo's discreet sophistication and handsomely understated environs, chef Michael Annondono shows the same respect for the humblest dish on his menu as for the grander creations. He does wonderful things with braises such as osso buco and lamb shanks, while sauteed dishes receive robust treatments. It's the pastas that especially warrant repeat visits to Michaelangelo's. The Sacchetti al Tartufo is a showstopper. A study in shades of white, its mild looks belie profound flavor; black-truffle-laced ricotta fills the small pasta "sacks," which are doused with truffle-scented cream sauce. Two other pastas vie for honors. The Agnolotti di Zucca, little half-moons stuffed with butternut squash and parsnip in a light fontina cheese sauce, are so cunningly understated, they sort of sneak up on you until you're hopelessly in love with their nutty-sweetness. Swoons came in the wake of lobster ravioli scattered with al dente rock shrimp. The desserts are pleasant, but the savory dishes are the real stars here.
However, within weeks of taking office, the Obama administration discarded that plan and promised to delay for two years and come up with its own plan for 2012-2017 instead. Then, last March, the administration announced the opening of these offshore areas for oil and gas production. The BP oil spill caused another stoppage.

Ms. Jones has always expressed mixed feelings about her instant fame, and by all accounts has followed her artistic gut. She now writes all her own material, and has steadily branched out from piano balladry to guitar playing and sometimes urgent grooves. She has recorded with elder statesmen (Herbie Hancock), but also rockers (Ryan Adams) and rappers (OutKast). Still, she acknowledges her lingering image as the darling of Starbucks.

When Britney Spears and Ke$ha pad their tracks with robotic effects and ear-catching electro-hijinks, we understand why: They’re doing what they can to keep their brand names relevant, and they’ve got to take steps to stand out. But Lady Gaga is the best vocalist on hit radio. Sometimes we forget that, and when we do, it’s at least partially her fault. She keeps distracting us with extra-musical nonsense. One of these days, she’s going to realize that she never needed the meat dress, or the cigarette sunglasses, or the raspberries blown at the steeple. All she ever had to do was sing.

The suburb's Planning Commission and Zoning Board again gave permission. But City Council voted 5-1 against the turbine.

Other menu choices also worked out well. We liked the mixed plate of tempura ($6.95) with a light, crisp batter, and we thoroughly enjoyed the pan-fried potstickers known as gyoza ($5.95). They were tender and tasty, with extra flavor from contact with the very hot pan. We also strayed from the ramen and went with the rice-based dishes called donburi. The chicken curry ($6.95) was full of complex spice and tenderness.
"It's something of a puzzle that a Canadian commercial boat would fish on the border and risk being cited," said Gino Barna, the head of Lake Erie law enforcement for the Ohio Division of Wildlife.

Mitt Romney, by contrast, wants to increase military spending to 4 percent of the overall GDP. He'd like to add, among other things, 100,000 troops and 15 Navy warships. Over the next decade, his spending increases would amount to $2.5 trillion over the Pentagon's current projections.

• But the Post wasn't done with Melo. George Willis, who also covers boxing, got a few good shots in as well: "It was time to play the role of hero. Instead, Anthony laid a dud, shooting just 7 of 23 from the field en route to 22 points in the Knicks’ disheartening 87-70 loss at the Garden... Some might point to a fourth quarter collapse as the reason the Knicks are down 0-3 in the series and set a NBA record with a 13th straight playoff defeat. But the tone for Anthony’s miserable night was set early when he made just 2 of his first 10 shots. Had it not been for some stirring play by the Knicks’ bench (22 points) and some inept shooting by the Heat, it wouldn’t have been as close as it was, 58-56 Miami, heading into the fourth quarter."
"They don't have anything to lose," Brown said of the Warriors (20-30). "They'll come in here, free and loose. If they shoot the ball and it goes in, we'll end up giving them confidence. If it doesn't go in, we may end up stretching the lead. Who knows."
The Rothrocks decided to start over—together. They treated each other as if they were the people they would date if they had divorced.

Like the Crowes, they're steeped in gospel, Southern-rock, and mild psychedelia. The guitarist uses his wah-wah without irony. They love the Stones.

Character witnesses at his trial called Paul Schurick a nice guy. But in political campaigns, even nice guys find themselves tempted by dubious tactics and cynical ideas, especially at desperate hour.

One team may never say a word to you and that’s the team that drafts you. So it’s really tough to say right now. I think a lot of teams have shown interest, but you never know until that draft day.”

While scouts are wowed at Griffin's all-around skills, Luck also has checked out with great athleticism to match his passing prowess.

The Cardinals and Diamondbacks exchanged big innings and big shots, but by the end Arizona had the bigger score, winning 13-8.

It's unfortunate that this issue has come up at a time when U.S.-China relations are already strained over a broad range of disagreements regarding trade and security. Yet the U.S. must remain firm in its commitment to human rights, however much China may insist that its internal affairs are none of our business. We need to make clear to the Chinese that we expect them to abide by the terms of the agreement they reached with us regarding Mr. Chen's status. Otherwise, how can we ever trust them to negotiate in good faith? They need to show us they can be trusted to keep their word, and if they are unwilling to do that, we should demand that Mr. Chen be allowed to return to our embassy immediately and stay there until the matter is resolved.

“At his 90th birthday celebration at Holy Trinity (he died at age 99 and would have turned 100 on Nov. 22), I kiddingly said in a mild roast that I only hung out with Claude because I wanted to find out the secret of extended life. It wasn’t the genes, because nobody in his family lived particularly long lives. It probably wasn’t his diet, because at some games he would disappear several times to gobble a variety of junk food (funnel cake was a staple).
Nobody should minimize the uneasiness -- to put it in the mildest term -- Detroiters may feel as their elected leaders enter into a financial consent agreement with the state. It is a very difficult situation.

With free agency set to begin on March 13, there have been a lot of questions about where the Ravens sit with the salary cap. That cap hasn’t been officially set, though it’s expected to be similar to last year’s number. Either way, all indications are that the Ravens are in decent shape with the cap, certainly in better position than they have been the past couple of offseasons. That doesn’t mean that the Ravens have the room to go on a free-agent shopping spree, because that won’t happen. That doesn’t fit with their organizational philosophy anyway. But it does mean that they should be able to keep a couple of their higher-priority free agents (Ben Grubbs will probably price out of their range) while also filling one or two needs with outside free agents. And they should get a little more flexibility by either releasing or restructuring the contracts of cornerbacks Chris Carr and Domonique Foxworth, and wide receiver Lee Evans.

"The guys stayed with it and didn't change because we didn't score goals," Brodeur said of Tuesday night's dramatic win. "We didn't change the way our coach wanted us to play.

Congress just finished a raucous, weeks-long debate over a new highway-funding bill, which transportation leaders hoped would supply more money for roads and bridges.
With the success “The Sims” has brought EA, the style and tone of their related titles have gotten more kid/casual gamer friendly. “SimCity” was the last bastion of true nerdhood in its arsenal, but the tone and look of the “SimCity” early footage suggests that casual gamers are in its sights. And why wouldn’t they be? If people will spend weeks of their life on Facebook managing a virtual farm, isn’t it conceivable that EA could sell a lot of copies of “SimCity” to those same individuals? It seems as though the multiplayer bug has also finally took hold of the franchise, interlinking players’ cities into regions, much like the transferable content in “Farmville”-type games.
Friday night's storm system was termed a supercell thunderstorm, and was far worse than the squall line thunderstorm that hammered Sunset Hills and other areas on New Year's Eve, Sieveking said. Squall lines are famous for their damaging winds but don't usually produce tornadoes - and when they do, the twisters are short-lived, he said. Supercell thunderstorms are known for long-path tornadoes, hail and damaging winds.

Activists were outraged by scenes showing cops manhandling suspects. Kelley took pride in scenes where his men acted honorably and humanely. Critics loved the show's gritty realism. Wiseman, who went on to air more than 30 of his films on PBS, always believed he had been fair to the KCPD. But he also said his approach was much more novelistic than journalistic.
The retrial, resuming after a five-day break and expected to last several more weeks, still seems light years away from addressing the principle question that could matter most to the jurors when they decide whether Clemens lied to Congress: Did he use steroids and human growth hormone during his remarkable 24-year career?

"The toys are all designed to be subtle satire of things that were being marketed to children in the '80s and '90s," says MacLane, who's 36, which means these things were marketed to him.

Super Pirate and Bozo the Ninja Clown are other examples.

Of course, there is not much the ECB can do if Greece decides to reject the bailout and leave the euro. But the ECB believes the bailout can be made to work and will continue to push Greece and other euro-zone countries to try to make it work. That may not please national governments, who can feel themselves being sucked deeper into the crisis. But until they can resolve their differences and unite behind a clear political agenda to fix the deficiencies in the euro zone's economic and monetary union and reduce their reliance on the ECB's liquidity, they have little choice but to defer to the one European institution that has shown itself able to act in the crisis.

There is even a multimedia "Walking with Buddha" attraction that explains the life of Siddhartha Gautama, on whose teachings Buddhism is based. Gautama was born a prince more than 2,500 years ago in what is now Nepal. Not fulfilled by palace life, he eventually left to become a monk, studying, fasting, meeting the sick and the poor.

His score, rendered in a two-piano reduction by the Zofo Duet (Keisuke Nakagoshi and Eva-Maria Zimmermann), is an intoxicating collection of chugging motoric rhythms, chiming harmonies and lyrical vocal lines.

De'Anthony Thomas, Oregon's superstar freshman, electrifies the crowd of 91,245 and evens the score on the quarter's final play as he takes a handoff up the middle for 91 yards. The play, coming on 2nd and 6 from the Oregon 9, breaks the Rose Bowl record for longest rushing touchdown, previously set by Michigan's Tyrone Wheatley in 1993 with an 88-yarder against Washington. It was also a sign of the great day to come for the player known as the Black Mamba. He finishes the game with 314 all-purpose yards -- 155 rushing, 125 on kick returns, 34 receiving. He closes the season with 2,235 all-purpose yards, second only to Jonathan Stewart (2,481 in '07) in UO history.
Much like the ravioli, the miso-glazed sea bass ($27) was in need of a third element to bring the flavors together. This time the rectangular plate held a hunk of fish on a sticky pool of miso glaze on one side and a mound of gummy green noodles on the other; they were refrigerator-cold and had the one-dimensional taste of jalapeno.

Don't expect any fancy optics. There is just a small, clear plastic disc below the shutter where a lens could be. There are a few tricks to advancing the film that didn't make it onto the tiny instruction sheet that came in the box.

Above all, the automobile's increasing speed, range and comfort would endow the city with its distinctive mega-scale. Which, in retrospect, may have been not so great a mega-idea. One hundred and twenty years into the automotive experiment, the wisdom of putting nearly every living soul in 500 square miles on wheels and letting them run all over the place is clearly debatable.

Immigration is not a high priority for most Latino voters, as Republicans are quick to point out. Jobs and education are considered far more important. But tone matters. And by talking tough and taking a hard-line stance on illegal immigration during the GOP primary season, Romney has made it much more difficult to steer the conversation toward other issues he now wishes to discuss, such as the high rate of Latino unemployment.

These reactions are most commonly reported in agricultural workers, cooks, bartenders, and grocery store workers, but also may be seen in gardeners and other inadvertently exposed individuals.

Christie, who has previously said he "can’t see eliminating binding arbitration" for police and fire personnel, received cheers from mayors who said rule changes could mean major savings in a system they claim favors labor unions.

From its first paragraph, the complaint paints a damning portrait of JPMorgan: "The story has been told time and time again how Madoff duped the best and the brightest in the investment community. The trustee's investigation reveals a very different story -- the story of financial institutions worldwide that were keen to the likely fraud, and decidedly turned a blind eye to it.

The Jayhawks have been living dangerously throughout the tournament, falling behind Purdue by 13, North Carolina State by 10 and Ohio State by 13. I have a feeling if Kentucky gets a double-digit lead the Wildcats will be able to pull away as they did against Baylor. So keeping the score manageable seems critical. Kansas has shot better in the last two games, but the Jayhawks continue to be lacking from the perimeter, making only 24 percent of their 3-pointers in the tourney. This is not a great perimeter shooting team, but if ever there was a night to get hot, this is it. That is especially true for Tyshawn Taylor, who is now 0-for-20 on tourney 3s, has missed 23 in a row overall and has never made one in a dome. This is his last chance.
He allowed a leadoff single to Jeter, his fourth hit of the night, and then walked Curtis Granderson. Mark Teixeira followed with a liner to second base, but Chris Getz snagged it in the dirt and fired to Alcides Escobar covering second to start a double play.

The bottom line is that reducing or eliminating the pickup is analogous to a pay cut, a new insurance co-payment or a furlough. Eliminating or reducing it without any offsetting compensation would be a tough sell to union negotiators. But any offsetting compensation waters down the savings.

And I'd never seen a grown man bowl an entire frame while holding a cell phone to his left ear. But now I know it can be done. And I suspect that if he'd tried that stunt after 7 p.m., the Lucky Strike dress-code enforcement officers would have tossed him to curb for unauthorized headgear.

If Simpson’s game isn’t as classically stylish as McIlroy’s or as colorful as Rickie Fowler’s (who is three back), it’s as doggedly resilient as any in recent months.

It feels unfair to dog all the performers, who included some of the company's notable technical whizzes. Gennadi Nedvigin's innate sense of musical phrasing illuminated a difficult allegro, and Vanessa Zahorian gave clarity to the speedy footwork of her whirlwind variation. But throughout the ballet, in corps and soloist ranks alike, there was a curious contrast between brittle attack into the steps and a markedly mannered use of the arms - flapping, if you will - which led to a sense of forced cuteness.

Such is Whedon’s skilled playfulness that, without the movie getting too self-referential, everyone gets plenty of sharp lines, even the pilot trying to shoot down Hulk, who says, “Target engaged . . . Target angry!” Reaching for a bit of the underlying seriousness of “The Dark Knight,” though, Whedon can’t quite grasp it.

The thick slice of Wagyu beef was excellent, but diminished by the clutter of whole turnips, carrots and an underseasoned pile of maitake mushrooms that needed an element to integrate them into the dish. The splatters of green sauce and swirls of what looked like carrot puree weren't enough to really taste, and did little to improve the main ingredient.
