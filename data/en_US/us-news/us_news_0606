What if their opponent has two great bunters? What happens when Rick Porcello pitches? Porcello induces a lot of ground balls.

Six months after getting spine surgery or receiving long-acting analgesic injections to the lower back, 14 of the original 18 subjects came back for more brain scans and cognitive tests. While several regions of the brain remained thinner compared with controls, one region of the brain--the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex--appeared to have regenerated itself in the treated subjects, and was no longer thinner than the same region in the brains of the control group. During a challenging cognitive test, the differences in brain activation that had separated the chronic pain sufferers from the healthy controls also disappeared.

CSM also ran a no-huddle spread offense, which helped Vaughn adjust (though he said about six times in the span of our 15-minute interview that the pace at Oregon is just a little bit faster).

Where Horn delivers is in his portrayal of an already emotionally vulnerable child who's bowled over by unimaginable grief. The attacks affected everyone, of course, but for most of us not so personally as they did Oskar, a little boy who could ill afford to lose his father, even more so than most little boys. Horn didn't need so much of Daldry's help to reach us, to move us, to break our hearts. He does a fine job of that on his own.

"For most women, predicting breast cancer risk on the basis of possible risk factors can be unreliable. Fully 70 percent of all women diagnosed with breast cancer had no known risk before the time of diagnosis. . . . To advise women age 40 and older to skip annual screening because they have no family history of the disease is imprudent, irresponsible and places their lives at unnecessary jeopardy."
The two also tried to head off concerns that have arisen this week that the bill could allow for a greater expansion than what is spelled out in the legislation.

Next, they taught him "bridge conditioning," a technique that reinforces behavior with a whistle and a treat. After that, comes target training, teaching him to put both paws on a target, in this case, a boat buoy attached to a pole, until he gets the signal – the bridge reinforcement – he can let it go. Once the sea otter pup gets the idea, trainers extend the time he must keep his paws in place.
A broader measure of the stock market, the Standard & Poor's 500 index, closed above 1,300 for the first time since Aug. 28, 2008. And at least one widely watched measure suggests stocks are still cheap by historical standards.

Dixon is richly aware of the heritage he's helping to uphold. As a young businessman, he takes pride in the fact that at lunchtime the restaurant has been packed with guests happy to return -- and $5 sandwich specials, including fries and slaw, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. are helping to rebuild traffic. In turn, he expresses concern that the first evenings have been considerably slower, with mostly takeout orders. (The restaurant also delivers food within the neighborhood.)

"We just can't afford it," said Miller from his shadowy book-lined office off the sanctuary. He told me the church had made a good-faith effort to bring the building into compliance, spending $130,000 to fix the roof and parapets in 1998. But the estimates for the interior work -- around $2.5 million -- are far beyond the community's means.

After Thursday's extravaganza, it might be the right time to think about the lightest meal of the day — or the meal that affords us the rest of the day to burn off some calories, anyway. Forget pancakes. How about savory Taiwanese crullers dipped in super-fresh soy milk, house-made longaniza sausage with eggs, sweet Belizean ducunu (they're like logs of unfilled tamale made with fresh corn grated off the cob) or poached-egg soup with hand-patted tortillas? Whether on La Brea Avenue or Bolsa Avenue, early-morning options abound. Here are several places to try from recent Find columns.
IEPA attorney Tom Turner said that the successor to American Zinc, Blue Tee, and the company that purchased the property after the plant closed, trucking company XTRA Intermodal Inc., would be considered responsible parties for the cleanup.

The Port Authority already had decided to scale back one aspect of the redevelopment, scrubbing plans to fully open the bird-like wings of the PATH hub to the sky. Instead, only the narrow roof of the station will open.
The comprehensive variety of Foss' compositional career is sometimes held up as a virtue, but, in hindsight, it looks more like opportunism. Like a Mitt Romney of 20th century music, Foss never encountered a stylistic trend he couldn't champion enthusiastically, at least until the next thing came along. "Echoi" is full of the tricks of its period - a little improvisation, a little theatricality, some cheesy electronics - without ever making a case for any of it.

In California last year, 91,009 low-income students took 160,605 exams. At schools and districts that participate in a state program that provides additional funds for AP fees, those students will pay $5 each for the first three tests, as required by California law.

But most importantly, there is something about losing in such a public manner that strips away any delusions of grandeur and leaves the world staring at the person you truly are. Sure, I could have blamed my loss on the difficulty of the questions, or the goofy format that randomized the money amounts, or how the sun got in my eyes. But in the end, the loss is mine and mine alone.

But a few factors are different this spring, scientists said. Spring rain typically pours fertilizers into the bay, spawning the algae blooms, but this year rainfall totals are about 5 inches below normal.

That makes for more hiding power than ordinary paints, a leveling of the ridges and valleys left behind by brushes and rollers, and it cleans easily.

I followed the tuskers to the edge of the Zambezi River. Crouching behind a thornbush, I suddenly had a front-row seat to a pachyderm party. As a column of moms, juniors and javelin-toothed jumbos neared the waterline, each would first bob its head, flapping huge, veiny ears, then kick up a knee, twirl a foot and back-step in a rubbery soft-shoe. These lumbering leadfoots were dancing, breaking it down as if they were soloing in the "Soul Train" line. I learned later that their moves are a ritual of ecstasy. The prospect of a bath sets off "happy feet."

"What we're facing today is a much, much larger global threat," said Seth Jones, an expert at the RAND Corp. who has advised the Pentagon on Afghanistan and Pakistan. "It's a more dispersed threat.

Angry Birds Space: Beloved by millions of mobile gamers, "Angry Birds" dropped workers' productivity (kidding!) and helped you avoid eye contact with strangers on the N Judah (seriously). The latest "Angry Birds" heads into space, combining its addictive gameplay of physics-based puzzles with a gravitational twist. Now your little birdies propel and orbit around planets and asteroids. While the original "Angry Birds" has predictable gameplay, "Space's" various planetary pulls and atmospheric speed-ups are major challenges, creating that "lucky shot" feeling. Honestly, most of the time I feel like Deanna Troi crashing the Enterprise for each level. But it's a joy watching your little birds hooking around planets knocking over obstacles. Though the space theme isn't a reimagination of the original or different enough to set itself apart from "Angry Birds" clones, "Space" does live up to its hype, delivering warp 9.8 fun.

For this was a night when it all could have ended, right here in Game 5 this magical hockey season could have been bagged for good, and instead the Wings skated to a magnificent win, their best of this series. They shut out the Maple Leafs and forced a return to Toronto in this best-of- seven second-round playoff. No dreams would die tonight. Not here. Not in Detroit.

This has essentially become the ideology of the zealots in charge of the Republican Party. Paul Ryan is perhaps the biggest joke the media has played on us in some time. A guy who is for some reason taken seriously despite being a complete fraud, delivered a budget plan in which our government would spend $4.6 trillion over ten years on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% alone. Ryan’s basic math is so ostentatiously awful (for instance, assuming that as soon as his tax cuts take effect, unemployment will immediately shoot down to 2%, which, to put that in historical perspective, has never even come close to happening except for World War II, also known as the biggest stimulus project the federal government ever embarked upon), you could literally write an entire doctoral thesis on what a joke his budget is. Paul Ryan is like the bastard love child of Herbert Hoover and Scrooge McDuck.
Let’s also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child’s success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom. In South Korea, teachers are known as “nation builders.” Here in America, it’s time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect. We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones. And over the next ten years, with so many Baby Boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math.

The program works best for people in dire straits - those too sick to work or needing expensive medical care.

"I believe the quiet car idea is a great concept, as many regular commuters want to enjoy some quiet time in their morning trips and also when returning after a long day at work," he said.

Lambrusco had the very small but important cachet of being imported, giving it a slight edge over Boone's Farm Apple Wine or Andre's Cold Duck. At the time, I thought that my mornings were painful because of the alcohol or the jarring ride in Bill's Monte Carlo (which had a red leather interior, a stock 350 and a loose transmission).

Republicans know Ohioans almost certainly would repeal House Bill 194 this November. That's why the GOP wants to beat them to the punch.

Roth symbolizes that world with the Winesburg chapel requirement: Students must attend 40 sessions of chapel before they can graduate. To Messner, the weekly, hourlong meetings in the town's Methodist church are unfair indoctrination.

Justice Kennedy set out a three-part test: Would the defendant have accepted the deal if he had known about it, would prosecutors have later withdrawn the offer, and would a judge have accepted it. None of that is easy to establish in retrospect, but the state has a strong case that Mr. Merzbacher fails on at least one count.

"I'm still at the stage where if somebody really likes my work, I want to be their friend," he says with a laugh.

At the very least, state regulators ought to be prepared to closely monitor these new facilities to make sure they do not exceed emissions standards.

How is the family life of these unemployed fathers? Are they spending more time with their children, overseeing more of the household chores, and preparing dinner for the family when Mom comes home?

Director Ron Daum has placed his emphasis on the fact that this production is presented as a yarn. It is narrated by Buffalo Bill, from his memory. Like his Wild West Show, it plays to the sensations of the moment, not inviting any emotional connection with the characters (in fact, the attraction of the warm and charismatic Annie to the stiff and arrogant Frank is difficult to fathom). What it does offer is a chance to engage with its themes, and their expression through its characters and music, in an exciting and entertaining way. Like any traditional theatrical comedy, "Annie Get Your Gun" confirms our sense of who we are, and reinforces that those things we hold dear are good and valuable and true.

Almost since the beginning of the commercial Internet - at least as far back as 1998, when Priceline.com launched - consumers have been bidding on travel. That model frequently benefited the travel industry, because customers didn't know how much to pay and often overbid for their rooms, rental cars and tickets. But now, BackBid, a Canadian startup, is flipping that idea on its head by asking hotels to bid for your business.

Q: What am I missing in the Manning/Tebow either/or discussion? It's John Elway's, John Fox's and Brian Xanders' job to put the best possible team on the field, and that means if a significant upgrade can be made to any position, you do it — quarterback included. If Peyton Manning is available, you try to grab him, no questions asked. In the short term it makes perfect sense, and any mature player understands that he's always going to be in competition. I suspect Tim Tebow understands this perfectly well. At the same time, there is the long term to consider. And if the Broncos can help Tebow to significantly improve his play, that's also an upgrade to the position, no? It's just not clear to me that the two are mutually incompatible, and that Elway in particular is unable to commit to both courses simultaneously. ... Do you think they have it in them to work through this for both the short- and long-term benefit of the team?

Among the first to recognize the importance of Hollywood photography, Kobal started collecting when movie memorabilia was cheap -- or free, since he also got material through gifts and through salvage.

Had it not been for Kobal, some of these stunning pictures might have been lost -- dumped or incinerated.

A lot of what most of us do all day is make decisions, big and little: what to have for lunch, how to get a project done at work, deciding whose calls to return first or who is going to pick up the kids, and many others we're barely aware of.
What's the deal: Subtitled "Stories, Recipes and Lyrics from Hawai'i's Favorite Folks," this anthology could be considered a "Saimin for the Soul" companion to the "Chicken Soup" series. Longtime Maui chef Mark Ellman, a self-described "haole boy from the Mainland," says in a promotional video for the new book that customers at his Māla Ocean Tavern restaurant often asked him what "aloha" really means, which in turn intrigued him. "I really wanted to know what Hawaiians, kama'āina and kūpuna (elders) thought it meant, as opposed to what musicians, or a chef, or a schoolteacher, or surfers thought it meant," Ellman says.

"He's not a great scorer. He's a great player," 76ers coach Doug Collins said. "Sometimes, we equate dollar signs with a guy's contract to how many points is he giving you. I equate it to, `What was a man's impact on the game?' And Dre has had an impact on every one of these games."

Joseph Hardwick, the young mechanic, did not usually board a flight himself. But he did on Wednesday, likely just "tagging along" on a "nice trip on Thanksgiving Eve," said Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, whose emergency crews mounted the search effort.
Not everyone found the series to be comedy of any stripe, however. Of the 1,400 newspapers that carry Doonesbury, about 70 pulled the strips and instead ran substitutes provided by Trudeau's syndicate, Universal Uclick. Ten other papers temporarily moved the strip from its customary spot on the comics page to another part of the paper. And 10 more responded in some other way, a few opting to run all of the strips except the Thursday one.

ø"I'll never forget in the early '80s, we played them all the time at Louisiana Tech, and she told (Louisiana Tech coach) Leon Barmore after a game: 'I'm going to keep playing you until I beat you.' And, boy, did she keep playing us. And then she developed, and look at the product she's put together at Tennessee. And now everybody wants to emulate her program," Mulkey said.

Jim Tressel can't specifically comment about players who haven't signed letters of intent, but he did reference a situation that he couldn't talk about and talked about the class having 23 players "at this point." It's fair to say that Ohio State was very surprised by the recent charges, and no decision about his future will be made until the potential legal issues are fully investigated.

The homestead credit's cost has ballooned to a degree never imagined by the state lawmakers who passed it in 1977, as a two-year measure to insulate homeowners from spiking home values. It was projected to cost less than $7 million statewide for both years combined, which comes to about $25 million in today's dollars. Now it's keeping $120 million out of the budget-strapped city's coffers just this year alone, according to The Sun's analysis and budget documents.

The options for oral appliances fall in two main categories: prescription devices you can get from a dentist or orthodontist and do-it-yourself products you can order online. All work by moving the lower jaw forward to create extra space in the airway, but they vary wildly in terms of cost.
Republicans think (and some Democrats may agree) that Ohio's "tax problem" isn't so much a state tax problem as it is a local tax problem, via piggyback county and mass-transit sales taxes; city, village and school district income taxes; and the endless parade of property-tax levies, mostly for public schools.

Posted in the 1980s in Detroit, Sullivan worked late nights on surveillance missions, said Michael McManamon, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent who worked with Sullivan. At one point, there was a string of rapes in Detroit where young girls were being kidnapped off the streets in the morning on their way to school, McManamon recalled. Even though they were not working on the rapes case, Sullivan and McManamon would stay in the area after their shifts and see that children got on and off the buses safely.

Metro took over Glendoveer from Multnomah County in 1996, one of many services or facilities, such as the Oregon Zoo and recycling, that it inherited from other agencies.

Gore's senatorial campaign had been something of an education for me. On the verge of 30, I was beginning to eke out a living freelancing opinion pieces under my name and for others in need of a certain rough eloquence. Having actually read a fair amount of Gore's work, I attracted the candidate's attention with questions perhaps a little more thoughtful than he had come to expect. With no need to impress a grumpy city editor, I deemed it unnecessary to mime the institutional skepticism of "real" reporters. This won me a certain hanger-on status when the campaign came to San Francisco. Gore--we were on a first-name basis by then--would occasionally communicate to me his disappointment at the varying degrees to which other writers would sup at his brainy banquet and then question his electoral bona fides. Inevitably, a newsworthy campaign appearance would be chilled by the stopper: "But really, Mr. Vidal . . . are you serious?"
Swelling from whispered intimations of guilt and heartbreak to orchestral eruptions of joy, the Wrens effortlessly melded achingly beautiful guitar lines and languorous sonic soundscapes with outbreaks of pure dissonance, urged on by the explosive stage presence of Kevin Whelan, who whips up the frenzy with huge arm swings and sudden bass thrusts into the crowd.

"What worries me is that businesses are deriving their strong earnings growth through productivity gains, limited wage increases and foreign activities," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. "While that may be good for an individual firm, when most companies do that, income gains become so limited that spending and ultimately growth fades. That is the problem we are now facing."

"Not getting enough sleep has been linked to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity and depression," says Jennifer Chubinski, director of community research for the Health Foundation of Greater Cincinnati, which conducted the Ohio poll on sleep habits.
To solve this problem, we must strengthen the agencies that oversee our food. Right now, the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture -- the thin blue line between our kitchens and a host of food-borne diseases -- cannot adequately protect us. These agencies are underfunded and understaffed, lack the authority to hold food companies accountable for the safety of their products, and can't keep pace with our increasingly complex food production and distribution system.

Stapleton: I would like to start by saying times like this I would not want AD Tim Pernetti's job, but i must say he handled it like pro! There were two great and qualified finalists, but i am extremely excited for Coach Flood. I truly believe he will continue the growth and the development of the program that Coach Schiano started 11 years ago and will help lead Rutgers to its first Big East championship. What I want Rutgers fans to understand and believe is that we are not "settling" for Coach Flood; I have been reading the papers and press and all they keep saying is "Rutgers settles for Flood', which is far from the case. Coach Flood is more than qualified for the position and we are lucky to have him as the program’s 29th head coach.

Warren claims that his views are mainstream, pointing out that in 30 states, the majority of voters have banned gay marriage. Popular doesn't mean right, of course, but regardless of what Americans think about gay marriage, on other so-called social issues, he's way out in far-right field.

But the highlight is the newly introduced "Taste with the Count" experience. For an extra $10, a costumed gentleman complete with stovepipe hat, brocade vest and lavish gray beard with sideburns will lead you on a 45-minute tour into the cellars, followed by a tasting. I admit, I worried it would be goofy - yet local actor George Webber does a spirited rendition of Haraszthy as he leads guests among "his" gardens, explaining "his" 19th century life.

When he thinks back on his annual visits, Halcisak said his thoughts are less about the cars than what the cars meant. For example, when he thinks back to shows from the late 1980s, he remembers the minivans he and his friends were considering as they started having children. Now, he and most of his friends are downsizing to sedans or sporty cars now that the kids are leaving home.

American Colonel Jack Knowles (the always excellent Roy Scheider) and Soviet Colonel Valachev (the also always excellent Jurgen Prochnow) are two obsessed war heroes. War is in their blood, it is what they live for, it is what gets them through their day. But there is no war to fight. Glasnost prevents it. So when Knowles is assigned to his new border post and witnesses the murder of a potential defector before he could reach the Americans, he takes it upon himself to start a war. And Valachev is more than happy to accommodate.
"New Jersey is going to be a battleground well into the future and long after other areas are given up on," said David Robinson, the state climatologist at Rutgers University.

May 21: Lane Community College Forum Building, Eugene
But a Gallup survey last fall showed how much things have changed: Support for capital punishment was down to 61 percent. Among the many reasons for the drop are a decline in crime rates, which has increased public confidence in the criminal justice system, and a stream of reports casting doubt on the guilt of some who were executed. In addition, significant groups of libertarian Republicans and opponents of abortion have crossed to the repeal side. An important test of the new politics of capital punishment will come this November in a California death penalty referendum.
