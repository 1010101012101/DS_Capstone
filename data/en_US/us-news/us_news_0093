To analyze who gave to 527 committees and how those groups spent their money, The Denver Post downloaded contribution and expenditure data from the Colorado secretary of state's office for the 2008 and 2010 election cycles. Unlike 527 organizations, contribution and spending data for independent expenditure committees cannot be downloaded. The Post went through the hard copy of roughly 25 groups who filed with the secretary of state's office to determine the spending patterns in the race for governor, state attorney general, treasurer, secretary of state, state Senate and state House. A 2010 Colorado law requires all independent expenditure committees to disclose their donors and disbursements.

The songbird cadences of Indian music and the whirling dances of the Roma became infused in multicultural mélange of Andalusia.

Cary Williams Sr. will admit, right up front, that he struggled to keep his head above water as a single father. He was confused, overwhelmed, and occasionally angry. He was too proud, he says now, to ask for help. At some point, he told himself the most important thing he could do for his sons was keep them away from drugs, and keep them alive. He had been a high school track star growing up in Dade County in the 1970s, and Cary and his brother never tired of hearing the neighborhood urban legend about the day their father outran a car in a street race. Sports, Williams Sr. believed, provided the only chance he had.

When the danger of frost has passed and you are clear to prune, we at the Desert Botanical Garden advise pruning to accentuate the plant's natural shape. Many native species are not easily molded into formal shapes because they don't grow as quickly as tropical or Mediterranean trees and shrubs. Seasonal pruning will promote a fuller growth and, in some cases, increased blooms. It is important that you know the best time of the year to cut, because some plants bloom on new wood, others on old wood. Pruning at the wrong time can mean loss of flowers for the season. For shrubs, springbloomers should be cut back after their flowering has ceased. Summer or fall-flowering shrubs can be cut back in late winter or early spring, before buds begin to form. For frost damage, wait for new growth to appear and cut back just above a node.

It's possible few players helped themselves more at the NFL combine than Irvin, who turned heads with his blazing 40-yard dash time of 4.50 seconds - easily the fastest of any player listed as a defensive end. Irvin's future could lie as a pass-rushing end in a 4-3 defense, although he may profile better as an outside linebacker in a 3-4 set. Either way, quarterbacks will want to keep an eye on him after he racked up 22 1/2 sacks in 26 career games at West Virginia, finally coming into his own after some rocky times during his teenage years. Irvin never finished high school and even spent some time in a juvenile detention center before earning his GED and attending junior college, then making the most of his opportunity in Morgantown. If NFL teams are convinced his off-the-field problems are in the past, Irvin's impressive rise could result in a first-round selection, although he's not without some football-related doubts.

Up Cass Hill we climbed, with No. 5 and sister Shay No. 2 churning furiously to conquer sustained grades in excess of 6% (6 feet up per 100 feet forward) that flirt with 9% for short stretches. (With conventional locomotives, steam or diesel, about 3% is considered the limit, and a taxing one.) But even with these steep gradients, scaling the mountain required two switchbacks, or zigzags, the rarest of all railway engineering expedients and a cumbersome last resort in gaining elevation. After the upper switchback, it was just half a mile to Whittaker Station, the site of the Mountain State Railroad & Logging Historical Assn.'s re-created 1940s logging camp.

Their collaboration proved fruitful, with two leads both garnering Golden Globe nominations for "Love & Other Drugs." (The awards were handed out Jan. 16, after Inside Jersey went to press.)

Teens require a certain amount of independence. But that doesn't mean they should have free rein. Adolescents aren't exactly known for their good decision-making, and parents need to impose some boundaries.

Rather than trying to break up a friendship, parents might want to "ground" a teen's social life, allowing the child to see friends at home under watchful parental eyes but not to go out with them.

The whole setup is bizarrely ad hoc. It's also not ideal for kids, especially the children of parents whose lower-wage jobs and unpredictable shifts make it hard to arrange high-quality, consistent child care.

At my place of employment, I interview all new hires. We get into all kinds of conversation. I am not only interested in what work skills they have to offer, but life skill as well. Simple mechanical skills, problem solving, other life skills. Many have no idea about simple stuff. It’s sad. Just take a look around and see what our government has done for us. Our education of our K-12 is failing. We have become a nation of welfare and unemployment. Third World status, where our government is to provide everything for all. Tax the rich to pay for unemployment and welfare for those too lazy to go out and work.

Ultimately, however, a disclosure-based approach may strike the best balance. Federal law already provides safeguards for sensitive personal information, such as health and credit data. The Federal Trade Commission and California prosecutors have the power to crack down on companies that make misleading statements about their privacy policies. And pressure from users has forced companies such as Facebook and Google to be more protective of other types of personal information they collect. Like Harris' move, the White House initiative will not only give consumers a bit more control over their information, but also shine more light on what companies are doing with it so users can make better choices.

It reminds me a little of a work stoppage in sports. In the NFL, the owners and the players dragged it out, but got it done in time to save the entire season and not do any damage to their sport. In the NBA, they stood firm until Thanksgiving weekend and cost themselves games, money and fan interest. If you knew you were going to get it done all along, why did they run the risk of hurting their game? If the Lions knew they were going to get this done all along, why did they run the risk of hurting free agency?

The governor's proposed budget isn't perfect — it's hard to imagine how it could be under the circumstances — but it does two important things.

Most studies examined the compounds' effects when given in conjunction with another drug, such as the antidepressant fluoxetine (Prozac) or lithium. In several studies, the folate compounds appeared to improve the effectiveness of the prescription drugs and in some cases to reduce unwanted side effects.
Josh Elston, general manager at Oceano, would only confirm that the restaurant was looking "west" for a second location, but he added that nothing had yet been finalized.

Cautiously, too, because there are seasonal perils to deal with. Hunters fire loud weapons in the fall.

And in summer, you'd best bring bug repellent, because no one is bombing insects with chemicals.
Main courses were equally well crafted, including rabbit three ways ($31), which consists of two loins wrapped in bacon and cut into coins, a confit chunk and a beautifully prepared rack. The diced carrots in the well-sauced lentils underneath were cut in perfect same-size squares, further showing off the chef's careful technique.

In college, he tended to lock onto a primary receiver, according to one front office man. If the primary was covered, Griffin would take off. He isn’t going to make Mike Shanahan happy if he’s doing that in Washington. The only way Griffin is the better player quicker is if his team is considerably better than Luck’s.
