Of all the great American between-the-wars writers — "the three kings," as Richard Ford referred to Hemingway, Faulkner and Fitzgerald in a 1983 essay, although I'd also include John Dos Passos in their company — the one who most spoke to me was Faulkner, with his flowing sea of language, his sense of the past, of history, as a living thing. Next to him, Hemingway seemed flat, two-dimensional. Where was his appeal? If only I kept reading, I might find out.

Standing on the floor in front of the approach, readying myself for the tenth frame, I picked up my bowling ball from the ball rack. As a left handed bowler, I held the bowling ball in my right hand, resting it against my body. As I began to step up onto the approach, I looked both ways, and found that bowlers on each side were already stepping up for their delivery.

Matt Vensel, reporter: It’s tough to forecast how good each NFL team will be when the schedule is released in April. The draft has yet to go down, there will still be free-agency tinkering, and injuries start to come into play as soon as the pads come on at training camp. Plus, all it takes is a couple of early-season wins for an overlooked squad to suddenly become dangerous (see Detroit and San Francisco last year). Here's what I do know: Teams with top quarterbacks are usually formidable. And the Ravens will have to deal with Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger (twice), Philip Rivers, Michael Vick, Tony Romo, and Matt Schaub. Andy Dalton tested the Ravens last year, too. And some are predicting a Cam Newton-type rookie impact for Robert Griffin III. Of course, the Ravens have a pretty good quarterback, too, and one of the most balanced rosters in the league, so five months out from Week 1, I would love to say that the Ravens will probably be back in the playoffs in January. But football happens, so I’m going to pass on making a win-loss prediction until training camp wraps up out at The Castle.

Meanwhile, as the course was being built, so was the hype. I don't know about you, but I was getting pretty tired of hearing how the Grand Prix was going to turn Baltimore into a world-class city, how suddenly we would be elevated into some exclusive club of better municipalities.

First, it should be remembered that unlike illegal drugs today, alcohol was never prohibited altogether. Laws forbade the sale and distribution of liquor, but personal use was not against the law. Second, alcohol prohibition was not enforced in the way today's drug laws are. Congress and the executive branch were uninterested in enforcing the law. Even many prohibitionists felt that the law was so effective, it did not need enforcement. Police, prosecutors, judges and juries frequently refused to use the powers the law gave them. In 1927, only 18 of the 48 states even budgeted money for the enforcement of Prohibition, and some states openly defied the law.

Clinton voters, the women who have been with her since the pageboy 'do, will stray back and forth several times before the election cycle is over, and some of them will settle on Palin. Who knows why? Some will have carefully constructed, well-considered reasons for their decision. Some of those reasons will be void because they're based on bad information. And some will choose her because she seems like the kind of woman who doesn't give a damn about wearing white shoes after Labor Day.
Since January, he said he's conducted meetings with representatives of about a dozen community groups to talk about the North Point/Sollers Point land "swap," as some neighbors call it. He said "there's a lot of support for it," but added that he hasn't formally proposed anything to the county.
Bryant sat in the interview room moments later nodding his head and smiling when a reporter relayed to him about Bynum's self-critical comments. He clearly understood his teammate's sentiments.

With the Blazers not in the postseason for the first time in four seasons, are you still interested in the NBA playoffs? If so, who will you root for? Are you going with the Eastern Conference or do you have a west coast bias?
So they come out in the second half, put Glen "Big Baby'' Davis on West and place Anderson on Roy Hibbert. That's a signal to Hibbert to dominate, and he did that against Anderson, forcing the Magic to put Anderson back on West.

• When using containers for vegetables such as tomatoes or blooming annuals, go for a foot wide or larger (especially for vegetables). Small containers dry out too quickly. Drill or poke holes in the bottom for drainage. Cover the holes with a coffee filter and fill with quality, store-bought, fertilizer-free potting soil (garden soil is too heavy; fertilized soils tend to have too much). Add fertilizer pellets per package instructions and fertilize regularly all season.
value-oriented funds have rules against buying companies that don't pay dividends, and own few Apple shares, he said. He, too, thinks it's likely that Apple will institute a dividend, which would raise the stock price by broadening the range of funds that will own Apple.

Edison spokeswoman Jennifer Manfre rejected Gundersen's premise. "When you change the alloy," she said, "it's less susceptible to corrosion but there's less heat exchange. The entire industry adapted to that new alloy."
As novels became a regular part of culture, authorship became clearer — that is, until the modern era. Again, readers wrestle with the intersection of fiction and truth-telling, as in the case of Bret Easton Ellis — whose "Lunar Park" features Bret Easton Ellis, who is both like and unlike the author himself. And then there is Philip Roth, whose protagonists have followed close at his heels. "Disentangling Roth from his fictional characters is like trying to scrape sauce off spaghetti," Sutherland writes.
The Olympic qualification process for soccer is awkward, at best. The U.S. team was put together solely for this tournament. The team it would have sent to London, had it qualified, would have looked much different. The United States and other national teams aren't playing with their best players, many of whom are tied to their European clubs at the moment. The Olympic teams can add three over-age players, and presumably other age-eligible players currently employed professionally. So the likes of Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan weren't on the pitch against El Salvador, which really shouldn't have mattered.
Old fashion gumshoe and a black lab with a fine-tuned nose helped seal the case.
According to league bylaws, students who live within Wilsonville High School boundaries must play on Wilsonville's youth football teams, even if they attend a West Linn elementary or middle school.

"If we're doing it right, no one ever sees the milkman," he said.
The lock box "eliminates any concern that we won't get paid," said Councilman William H. Cole IV, one of the deal's architects. "Only the city of Baltimore can authorize release of it. They can't get loans against it. They can't charge against it. They can't pledge against it. They can't dance on it. It's our money."
"I think that argument is flawed because it fails to take into account that charter school students are disproportionately students from challenging economic circumstances," Cerf said.
For vegetarians, Brussels sprouts are also a good source of vegetable protein; 31 percent of calories come from protein. But because it is an incomplete source, it must be complemented with whole grains throughout the day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“Hey, I've been there before,” said Torii Hunter, who went through something similar when he left the Minnesota Twins after 11 years and signed with the Angels. “I did feel that pressure on me. But my personality — I get along with everyone so I felt like I fit in right away. And I didn't change leagues.”

Denver cut the lead to four points late on consecutive hustle plays by Faried, but Bryant scrapped for a loose ball on one end and led the break to the other, feeding Bynum for a dunk—his first points of the fourth quarter—and a foul with 2:15 to play.
The biggest roadblock is the lack of credit, said Rebecca Sutton, the city's chief financial officer. Tourist-tax collections fluctuate too much to support bond financing. So, to finance the venues, the city so far has used the credit of the downtown Community Redevelopment Agency to issue bonds. County tourist taxes are then used to make the debt payments on those bonds.
Clemens' legal team used the book Wednesday to try to raise doubts about an old, torn label that Radomski said was used for a shipment of human growth hormone to Clemens' home about 10 years ago. Clemens' Houston address is on the label — a seemingly tangible connection between the seven-time Cy Young Award winner and performance-enhancing drugs — and the name on the label is that of Brian McNamee, Clemens' former strength coach.
"When we got on the phone, I was the first one to say 'I want to be a Tar Heel,' " Mavunga said.
It's February -- although you're excused if you hadn't noticed. At the risk of jinxing us all, the weather has been so ... kind. So maybe we'll all be inspired to fight the temptation to stay in and curl up with a book this weekend (or whatever people curl up with these days) and take advantage of some of the finest Portland events our fair city has to offer.

But the argument can't be that we all are somehow entitled to have everything we want given to us for free, or that we're somehow being treated unfairly when that doesn't happen.
Other economic data released this week has been positive. The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group, said Tuesday that the manufacturing sector grew in August for the first time in 19 months.

City planners hope to boil all of that down in time for the council's April 6 executive session, Bowers said.
And then there's Broadway star-turned-country singer Laura Bell Bundy. She graced the red carpet wearing a spangled bathing suit, which would have been oh-so-very-Katy Perry of her, but she apparently made an attempt toward decorum by draping it with a bright blue skirt. And then thought, screw decorum, and threw the skirt aside like it was a curtain and her thighs were the opening act.
At our dinner for six, we had a minor setback when the goat cheese ravioli starter came out with four on the plate rather than the half-dozen we’d been told. That led to some awkward knifing and passing, but with their light tomato and garlic surroundings, the raviolis went fast.

At trial, BNSF offered another ladder as evidence to demonstrate that the equipment was in working condition. But the judge refused to admit it as evidence after Early testified that the facsimile was in no way similar to the ladder he was using at the time of his injury. In 2003, a jury awarded Early $5.5 million. Two years later, a Missouri Court of Appeals panel upheld the award and said the judge "properly found that admission of this evidence would have been prejudicial to Early."

Indeed, Johnson-Weiss is a gifted singer, but she approaches Holiday from an actorly perspective. In between such familiar songs as "The Joint Is Jumpin,'" "T'ain't Nobody's Business If I Do," "God Bless the Child" and the ever-chilling "Strange Fruit" and some lesser-known tunes, her patter opens little glimpses into Holiday's attitude (good-natured sarcasm tinged with real bitterness), her life (fraught with bigotry, addiction and exploitation) and her times ("Strange Fruit" says plenty about that).
"There are so many nuclear plants, but not a single one will be up and running today, and that's because of our efforts," Ishikawa said.
"There's nothing I can do but stand there and watch. It's a miserable feeling to see it," Phelps said. "I didn't think it was that bad. I was just hoping he caught it funny or sprained it or something, and then we came in here after the game and found out the news."
Herzog and de Meuron are as highly regarded as any of their peers, yet their 180-member firm doesn't have a predictable design style. The lifelong friends are more concerned with how a building functions than how it looks, and they often use familiar materials in unusual ways. Consider their two other projects in the United States: The Dominus winery in Yountville has walls that consist of rock-filled wire baskets, while the new Walker Art Center expansion in Minneapolis is wrapped in crinkly aluminum.
In an interview Wednesday evening, Williams said she did want the Senate District 21 reconfigured in the manner suggested by Republicans and fully supported the changes initially offered by Republicans.
And Quayle concedes that secession probably is too complicated to accomplish this time, as well. The path to secession is a migraine, not a mere headache -- the state Legislature must approve the U.P. seceding and then Congress must OK a 51st state. Which peninsula would get the Mackinac Bridge -- and its tolls? What would be the new state's capital?

Garcia’s clunker capped off what’s been an unimpressive beginning for the starting rotation as a whole. Through 10 games — or two full turns in the rotation — Yankees starters have managed just two quality starts.

Scoring Summary:
Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller were two money magicians who migrated from a mastery of insider trading -- the foundation of the era's great market-based fortunes -- to the invention of systematic philanthropy, though not, as is so often assumed, to assuage troubled consciences. As Lears puts it, "Despite vast differences in personal style, Carnegie and Rockefeller had much in common. Eventually both migrated to systematic philanthropy, contributing to the common good even as they disregarded it in their business practices. Both shared a tendency to conflate their own interests with those of society . . . as well as a talent for self-deception that dissolved moral ambivalence in a warm bath of ideological certitude. In this they were no different from captains of commerce in their time and ours."

The reasons Glickman and others don't recommend the "live high, train low" method espoused by some athletes are complicated.

Oglesby helped organize teach-ins and rallies, and his power peaked in November 1965 with his speech at an early, and massive, antiwar rally in Washington. In an address titled "Let Us Shape the Future," Oglesby spoke as a disillusioned patriot and liberal who rejected not just the war, but much of American foreign policy since the end of World War II and the free enterprise system he believed demanded endless conflict. He was equally critical of Republican and Democratic presidents as victims, and enablers, of the corporate state and insisted the country's founders would have been on his side.

Reyes describes Lewis' admiration for the poem (this may be why there's a Roman flavor to many of the scenes in his "Narnia" series, especially the sea journeys and battles); he enjoyed his own version so much that he read it aloud to his Oxford friends, including J.R.R. Tolkien. After his death in 1964, his brother W.H.

We're told, in the introduction, that the author's secretary, Walter Hooper, saved them. Whew.

The way it used to be, on almost any given evening an irrepressible assemblage of Mexican food vendors would flood a Boyle Heights parking lot in what seemed like seconds. Empty tables suddenly were covered with tubs of masa and astringent salsas, and griddles glowed with immediate heat. Before you knew it, diners would be perched on plastic chairs and crumbling curbs, their fingers stained an inky, huitlacoche-rich black. Couples quickly huddled around cups of goat consommé as kids eyed the cinnamon-dusted ridges of freshly fried churros. It was a mesmerizing sight, one that transformed a patch of otherwise-empty asphalt.

"But I have been clear that the communities that get federal help will be those who have their act together. They have to get together, or we're going to lose out on the next reauthorization, which is coming at us very quickly. Everyone here reads the press.

Mexican food is not, by nature, unhealthy—or not more so than French or even Chinese food is. Yet Taco Bell romanticizes the most fattening character of both popular American and Mexican food. It cannot be only a historical irony that this business symbiotically evolved out of and alongside the hot dog and hamburger culture. (Like Bell's original taco stand, the first McDonald's opened in San Bernardino. Meanwhile, an early Bell business associate became a cofounder of the Del Taco chain, and Bell's wife supposedly came up with the ungrammatical German name for another friend's fledgling business, Der Wienerschnitzel.)

The tape surfaced during settlement negotiations with organizers of the Miss California USA pageant, which fired Prejean. Prejean had filed a lawsuit alleging, among other things, religious discrimination, saying organizers punished her for saying she opposed gay marriage during the Miss USA question-and-answer segment.

It's clearly not working!)

Mr. Paterno deserved the opportunity to serve as coach for the remainder of this season.

But in the end, for me, the answer couldn’t be simpler, which is that there are some things you can’t support. … Politicians can’t take away our rights. We own those.

To some extent, though, we all have to decide for ourselves what’s useful. So, dear readers, which is it? Are you looking for help with consumer choices -- whether to buy or not? Or are you interested in reviews as a way to compare your own interpretations of the art, or perhaps as a kind of proxy experience for the art itself? Do you read reviews to learn what to think about a show (or book or whatever)? Or to discover options for how to think about it?

"This is a real touchy issue," said an agent who would only speak on the condition of anonymity. "It really comes down to how aggressive the team leader wants to be.

I decided to stick to the city's ubiquitous street stalls, and I vowed to eat whatever was set before me, no matter how mysterious. I did, however, sample some upscale noodles aboard an overnight junk cruise on stunning Halong Bay. The UNESCO world heritage site is a three-hour drive from the city and home to an otherworldly web of limestone islands, caves and emerald waters. And I dumped an entire bowl of soup in an alley when the old woman who served me wasn't looking because I thought I spotted an eyeball staring up at me from the broth.

This is progressives' idea of "progress." They've railed against every economically viable form of energy -- coal, oil, natural gas. Now, post-Japan, they'll be crossing atomic power off the list, too. Leaving . . . no viable energy options at all -- besides conservation.

He suggested consumers look for the label "picked by an American citizen." I would make a minor change to the label wording by printing, "picked by E-verified workers." The growers who abide by the E-verify employment laws will soon find their products are the choice of the American consumer and put non-compliant growers out of business. I am writing my elected representatives now.

The creative planning might mean putting a more convenient spin on a traditional dish. Cioppino, for example, is an expected Christmas Eve dinner - loaded with fresh, local seafood that fits the season.

The book musical came into its own after George Gershwin's heyday, but could shows pre-"Oklahoma!" really have been this much of a chore when characters weren't belting or hoofing? The only thing holding my interest was the question of when Estelle Parsons, who plays Jimmy's mother, would finally appear. The suspense over whether this Oscar-winning veteran had been cut from the production (but not yet the playbill) surpassed even the excitement of how Jimmy and Billie's romantic fate would unfold. (Parsons does eventually come on the scene, deus ex machina style, to help resolve the impossible plot.)

Kennicott celebrates the “relatively small representation of Eisenhower” because “there were other Eisenhowers right behind him, other men who could have done what he did, who would have risen to the occasion if they had been tapped.” How sweetly democratic. Greatness can be tapped hither and yon. But if greatness is so abundant and assured, it is hardly greatness, so cancel all memorials.

Today, they account for nearly 10 percent of births nationally.

"That's my family, man. I had a lot of fun with those guys. That's what you build out of this game. Just because you're wearing a different uniform, that doesn't mean the relationship is going to change.

I'm sick of suburban Republicans complaining about money spent on "nonessential" trains and bike paths that "a fraction of the population use," while beating the drum for taxpayer bailout of millionaire sports players and owners with a Vikings stadium.
