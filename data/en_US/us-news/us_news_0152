And how about the joke the final week of the regular season became? Is the NBA proud of that? A lot of people paid good money to see the Heat with James Jones, Udonis Haslem, Dexter Pittman, Mike Miller and Mario Chalmers lose to the Wizards with Chris Singleton, Jan Vesely, Kevin Seraphin, Jordan Crawford and John Wall. You could see better games than that on most weekends at Garfield Park.

As any economist worth a quarter of their Wall Street salary will tell you, there's no way to gauge the yuan's true market value so long as capital is barred from flowing freely into and out of China's economy. And, in the next breath, that same economist will likely explain that for all its emphasis on "internationalizing" the Chinese currency, Beijing is in no hurry to break open the capital account. To allow true convertibility would be to concede an even more important power: The ability to tightly control the interest-rate spread that Chinese banks operate under.
Bigford was the biggest impact player for Washington, which finished 12-13 overall and 3-4 in the GAC North. As a senior shortstop, he led the team with a .435 batting average, 24 RBIs, 21 runs scored and 37 hits, 12 of which were doubles.

Staggs, 49, was known as a favored executive and is considered a potential successor to Iger, but the former Wall Street analyst lacked operational experience.

Our first fish fry at Holy Angels Church was a memorable one. After a tremendously successful season, we noticed a horrible odor developing in the parish kitchen. Assuming we had not adequately cleaned out the stoves, fryers and convection units, we scrubbed and de-odorized every appliance. To no avail. The smell kept getting worse and worse. Eventually we'd close the kitchen doors and open up the windows to let fresh air in. It seemed unimaginable that we could not reach whatever it was causing the potent smell. After three weeks, I happened to see something strange above the warming oven. There were stacks of baking pans, which we assumed were clean. However, the bottom pan was oozing liquid. When I separated the pans, the bottom one contained a whole lot of baked fish -- now three weeks old! Clean baking pans had been placed on top of the full pan, and no one noticed -- until the smell was unbearable. Needless to say, the pans are the first thing we check after each fish-fry night! Lesson learned! -- Father Dan Schlegel, Chagrin Falls

Many of the officers who defected from the army in April used to be part of the Tutsi-led CNDP rebel movement that swept across large swaths of eastern Congo at the end of 2008 until a peace agreement was signed in January 2009. The rebels were speedily integrated into the national army that became a conglomeration of numerous rebel groups and militias along with mutinous soldiers. Congo endured back-to-back civil and regional wars that erupted in the aftermath of neighboring Rwanda's 1994 genocide and ended in 2002.

Last year, in one week, I witnessed two people jump to their death from the bridge. The first landed in the water near Fort Point. I was at the end of a bike ride, and people started yelling that there was someone in the water. In spite of huge waves, a Good Samaritan jogger jumped in, swam out to him and pulled him back in. The surge made it very difficult to get him out of the water, and in fact pulled another rescuer into the water with him. Finally, I had to get in up to my waist to help lift the man out. He didn't make it, and the reaction of people's goodwill put their own lives at risk, too.
According to Kristina Austin, director of community relations and marketing for the Gathering Place, before the Richman Family Wellness Center was opened, exercise was a component of the Gathering Place for survivorship.

6. Earlier this week, I wrote a story about Molina's penchant for pickoffs and whether having a new first baseman would alter his gunslinger approach. The short answer: no. The long answer: Of Molina's 37 pickoffs that have ended with a swipe tag at first base, Pujols' hand has been in that glove 35 times. As I researched all of the pickoffs Molina has initiated, I was surprised how many involved Pujols through the years. Maybe, I shouldn't have been. I won't repeat the whole article here, but one point that didn't reach that story was made by manager and former catcher Matheny. He thinks there could be more pickoffs early this season for Molina.

The secret to designing a theme park ride: When Goddard was in college in the 1970s, he visited Walt Disney Imagineering in Glendale, the design and development arm of the Disney company. Marc Davis, a top attraction designer, showed Goddard a painted model of a ride that was never built called the Western River Expedition.

"That 10- to 15-minute walk-through of his ride with him was the master's thesis in what goes into designing a ride and what you do and don't do."

To deny such proficiency would push them back in opportunity's line.

The numbers that once defined baseball immortality -- such as 500 career home runs or 60 homers in a season -- were cheapened by steroid cheats. In their place came "sabermetrics," new statistics devised by specialized analysis.

Longstanding, untreated high blood pressure can result due to weakness and abnormal muscle stiffness. Toxins, including large amounts of alcohol over a prolonged period of time, can damage the heart. This condition often improves or resolves when eliminating alcohol intake. Certain chemotherapy agents can have a similar effect, so patients being treated with these medicines should be closely monitored. Some viruses can affect heart function. Rarely, following pregnancy, women can develop weakness of the heart muscle. These conditions usually respond well to treatment and, in some cases, are completely cured.

Because Republicans have mastered the art of political jujitsu.

Jean-Jacques Taylor, ESPN.com: "Larry Brown, who professed his interest in the job about three weeks ago after saying he wanted to return to coaching in some capacity, is close to snagging the gig because Orsini can't persuade someone else to take it. Sad, isn't it? Brown is reportedly going to be accompanied by some dude named Tim Jankovich, who's currently the head coach at Illinois State. Jankovich will reportedly be SMU's coach in waiting, a necessity because of Brown's age and his propensity to leave jobs soon after he gets hired. Don't forget, Brown hasn't coached a college basketball team since 1988."

And the economy may be growing only slightly better in the current quarter. Consumers remain squeezed by gas prices, scant pay increases and a depressed housing market.
But other statements contain factual assertions that can be easily debunked if they are wrong. For example, FactCheck.org has disputed an ad by a candidate for the U.S. Senate in Michigan claiming that President Obama's stimulus "lost 2.6 million more jobs." In fact, the figure was 428,000 jobs. Other misleading ads rely on insinuation. Take "Facts," an anti-Rick Santorum ad produced by Restore Our Future, a pro-Mitt Romney super PAC. Showing an image of a prisoner in an orange jumpsuit, the ad claims that Santorum "even voted to let convicted felons vote." The irresistible implication is that Santorum enabled prisoners to vote while they were incarcerated. In fact, they wouldn't regain the privilege until they had served their time. Rather charitably, PolitiFact Florida, a project of the Tampa Bay Times and the Miami Herald, rated the ad "half-true." Half-true should not have been good enough for a responsible station to air it.
Yes. That's the question. And I am not implying that you should climb behind the wheel of your automobile this morning, and start honking for Kevin Durant until it comes true. It's not going to change a thing. The billboards, and that opportunity, faded away long ago.

His desire, he says, was to "open a lodge, a showplace with an Out West feel, and cater to people."

A. I thought that was important, particularly as I realized how much influence we had. By the late ’60s, I was doing a lot of appearances for Marvel, going to a lot of high schools, colleges, and I realized, these students were really into it. They would say, “So, Stan, Thor being a Norse god, how does that relate to Judeo-Christian ethics?” I mean, these kids were really deep!

In those days, the predominant tensions were between Native American tribes and French settlers, who were succeeded by the far more brutal British before the area passed into American hands.

“We are the Devils. We are New Jersey’s team.” It’s now more than just a marketing tactic; it’s a statement of unequivocal truth.

The team name is based on a Jersey urban myth. The horn-tailed “NJ” monogram functions much like the Yankee “NY.” Fans are encouraged to “Show your Jersey pride!” and “Get your Jersey on!” Moreover, the Devils assumed the ambitious task of leading revitalization efforts in downtown Newark with their move to the Prudential Center in 2007.

Others testify to the wearer's faith like a gospel chorus: Below a silhouette of the radio-topped hills a slogan reads, "Bernal Heights: I breathe it, I love it, I live it." Another appeals to our growing population of baby-toting mamas. Superimposed against the hillside is a picture of a baby in a stroller, accompanied by the words "Maternal Heights."
