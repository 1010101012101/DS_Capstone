Cherry Creek principal Ryan Silva insisted "we wanted to be very comfortable with Coach Logan and we wanted him to be very comfortable with us.

The Blazers were complicit here, too. They bubble wrapped Oden from the start. They reduced expectations. They apologized for him. When he planned that unfortunate private bash on his 21st birthday, complete with a car-dealer sponsorship, beer sales and a $10 cover charge at a downtown club, it was the Blazers who scrambled to cancel the thing.

But even if you believe the question is appropriate, the bigger problem in this case is that it's hard to imagine how the state can use the data. With 40% of respondents declining to answer, the survey is an incomplete measure of diversity anyway. This was an ill-conceived attempt at promoting diversity on the part of the Legislature.

To celebrate, why not take a trip? When you arrive at the airport, all of those silly Transportation Security Administration agents will be gone.

YOU Docs are on record saying that for folks 50 and up, the vaccine called Pneumovax reduces inflammation that damages blood vessels and makes your brain foggy and your thinking fuzzy. Dr. Oz got this high-caliber shot when he tuned 50; so did Young Dr. Mike! Does Prevnar do the same? Probably, but frankly, preventing pneumonia and possibly reducing your risk of heart attack by 50 percent is more than enough reason for us -- and you -- to go ahead and get vaccinated. Medicare and most insurance companies cover it. If yours doesn't, SWITCH; they are demonstrating just how much they do not care about you. * * *

Revenue at Denali Marketing more than doubled from 2008 to 2009. The company had 60 employees and had hired 35 people in the 12 months that ended in February, when it completed the Workplace Dynamics survey.

Murphy said she's confident that Denali's culture will remain largely unchanged after the merger.

World Peace's latest act shouldn't wipe away the goodwill he's built in largely keeping his emotions in check with his near three seasons with the Lakers. With exception to clotheslining J.J. Barea in the waning seconds of Game 2 of the 2011 Western Conference semifinals, World Peace toed the line in providing physical play but not letting the emotions overtake him. Still, World Peace's intentions don't always correlate to bottom-line results, and no one can fully anticipate if he'll provide the same value he had done in April until he steps back on the court and proves it.

Not everyone agrees with the Public Affairs approach. And the calendar has sparked a debate about whether the politicians' poses are more likely to break down walls or reinforce stereotypes. The Public Affairs women "should be presenting themselves by showing what they want to achieve, not by showing off their looks," says Zuzana Graczova, a human-resources manager at Czech consulting company Brain Logistics. Ms. Graczova says she doesn't expect much change in government policy despite the greater female representation in parliament.

The Kings’ penalty killing has been a key to their success to date — they’ve killed all 12 disadvantages and have scored twice while short-handed in this series — and they’ve continued to benefit from the stellar play of goaltender Jonathan Quick. He has stopped 55 of 58 shots for a .948 save percentage and 1.50 goals-against average.

Though Vikings owner Zygi Wilf had never explicitly threatened to move the team -- and was already committed to play in the existing Metrodome for one more year -- Monday's vote was driven by a sense that the team would leave without a new, taxpayer-supported stadium.

The glowing lanterns bob slowly in the water as the nearby skyscrapers reflect the last rays of the sun.

Attorney Muyyiad Obeid al-Ezzi, the head of al-Hashemi's defense team, told reporters that the Iraqi constitution allows the nation's president to demand that parliament create a special court to hear cases against senior government officials.

The Carnegie Mellon research demonstrates why identifying photographs isn't a simple process. In part of the study, computer scientists recruited and photographed 93 volunteers, all of whom had Facebook profiles, entering a university building. The software compared those images with a database of Facebook photos of people on the Carnegie Mellon network, and generated potential matches for all of the study volunteers. But only one out of three people in the study, when shown potentially matching Facebook photos, said they actually appeared in the images. In other words, even when the software was searching for matches from among a narrow pool of images, it was still wrong two-thirds of the time.

The growing problem comes as a byproduct of Americans and food manufacturers swapping trans fats for polyunsaturates in their products during the past 10 years. This has resulted in a whopping 58 percent drop in trans-fatty acid consumption in the United States in the past decade, according to a recent government report. But for all of their artery-blocking evil, trans fats had at least one big benefit: They were very stable, meaning they took forever to go rancid. The same is true of highly refined white flours.

Martin Scorsese making a film from a children's book is as improbable as, well, Martin Scorsese making a film from a children's book. But with its beautiful panoramic shots of 1930s Paris, the director's visually thrilling "Hugo" has real moments of 3-D magic.

Playwright Luce has declared himself a specialist in one-person plays. He wrote "The Belle of Amherst" about Emily Dickinson, which had a nice run for STC in 2011, prompting the company's return to the well of Luce's profitable pen. While it's tempting and easy to go on about the fascinating wreck of Barrymore himself, the play is more of a conundrum.

Please, purists, spare me the "human element'' argument so often advanced in baseball. Are mistakes going to be made by all parties in all sports? Yes.

"The 'NO BICYCLES' sign is so small and so high that no one seems to notice. The sign should be larger, lower, and state 'NO BICYCLES ON SIDEWALK.' The bicycles are supposed to be on the street. This is unsafe for everyone. There is virtually no automobile traffic on the street so there is no reason to be on the sidewalk." Carroll's suggestion was forwarded to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, which says it's not responsible for the signage, and to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which did not respond but seems to have jurisdiction over the area.

Redmayne again proves himself an extraordinary young actor, especially because he is called upon to portray, in effect, two characters. There's the young, love-struck boy that Stephen is in 1910, and the walled-up military man he becomes. Much of Stephen's transformation is conveyed not through dialogue, but, instead, with silent stares and glares. In fact, a lot of Abi Morgan's script seems to consist of characters staring meaningfully at each other, especially in the first half of the two-part film. Redmayne and Poésy stare convincingly.
