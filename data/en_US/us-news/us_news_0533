Your front-page analysis of the recent federal court decision striking down Maryland's "right to carry" handgun law conveys the misimpression that the law is ill-conceived and too "restrictive" ("Gun ruling likely to be upheld, say legal experts," March 7). Nothing could be further from the truth.

That he's turned to a proposed amendment shows more than Bishop intends. It's an act like nullification or secession, rooted in despair -- a way to get around the House and Senate rather than engage in legitimate governance. Would it not be better and more honorable for Bishop to resign his seat and to push the matter in the states from outside the Congress whose will he wishes to thwart?

In Boston, Samarov painted self-portraits, right there in the car, using rearview mirrors. In Chicago, he paints and writes mostly at home, from memory, taking notes by tweeting the details back to himself. Asked what he would do for a subject if he did well enough as an artist or writer to stop driving, Samarov had no clear answer. But he doesn't want to drive forever, he said. Fitzpatrick, who has heard Samarov say this often, said he understands wanting to be successful enough to stop driving a cab, "but I would miss Dmitry's eye if he stopped, his tales of the city. One of the reasons I had him on call was I liked those stories. Because he always had some misadventure. He sees the world for what it is, yet keeps a curiosity about it, and that's rare." Said Patrick Monaghan, owner of Saki: "Some artists take a snapshot of a moment and store it in their heads. But there are a billion cab drivers, and how many are aware enough to spot those moments?"

Watching Bacon, Stern, Rourke, Reiser, Guttenberg and Daly play Mobtown guys who think they can reach manhood on an installment plan — and Barkin as the odd woman out (the Stern character's wife) and Michael Tucker as an elder statesman among diner guys — you understand why they became marquee names for film, stage and television.

Obama may succeed in getting Republican support for trade pacts on a new education law that insists on school reforms.

And Huff is only the latest ballplayer to become overwhelmed and show that even the best athletes are still human.
Abraham Washington made his return to WWE television, trying to sign Henry as his client. Washington will likely be better suited as a manager than a talk show host. The only confusing thing is Henry being so upset; he won the match and has a rightful claim to another title shot. Hopefully he'll take Washington's advice and get what's coming to him. If not, maybe there's a Harvard Law grad lurking in the hallways somewhere.

I think moms like myself and people who are really busy on weeknights still want to cook, but they really need simple, easy, tasty ideas. They're looking for simplicity, and that's what our lives need. I have a 4-year-old, and she's not a picky eater, but keeping her interested is a whole other game. I've had to come up with ways to keep her having fun at night and looking forward to dinnertime, which isn't always easy. You have to get a little gimmicky, so I do things like breakfast for dinner. My daughter loves pancakes, so I just swap it and instead of giving it to her for breakfast I give it to her for dinner, and that excites her.

Rose wrote irresistible verses as well as shoutalong choruses, and Slash matched them with leads that emphasized phrasing and long held notes rather than speed. Duff McKagan, too, took a melodic approach to his bass parts, adding near-symphonic richness to the songs. Rhythm player Izzy Stradlin wasn't the group's most prominent member, but he penned much of the group's most famous material.

The Prospect was founded in 1990 by Robert Kuttner, Paul Starr and Robert Reich partly to provide intellectual competition from the other political shore to the neoconservative Public Interest. It blossomed into a magazine that honors and invests in long-form journalism, "the deeply reported piece that requires a huge amount of time and effort from a writer," says Kit Rachlis, the magazine's current editor. "There's a strong need for this in the age of Twitter," argues Rachlis, who had successful stints at Los Angeles magazine, the LA Weekly and the Village Voice, "since print venues for long form have been dwindling." No kidding.
Ducks coach Chip Kelly told me last week that he's never met Brown. And the head coach and I discussed all the mentors in the Oregon program who are wonderful influences on a kid who needs one badly. Gary Campbell, James' position coach at Oregon, is solid. So are other assistants such as Jon Neal, Don Pellum and Steve Greatwood. As well as Kelly and many teammates also who give the running back all the support he needs.
Tracy offered $50. The men settled on $75, he said. And since that day, Tracy figured he'd get the ring back to Webster because "if it was my ring, I'd want it back."

The problem was most acute at Chapeau, where Gardelle's wife, Ellen, continues her role at the front of the house.

I tested an idea that aims to change that practice: Appy Couple. It functions as a couple's official wedding app and guides guests through a wedding. They can use it to track information about the bachelorette party or other pre-wedding events, and on the wedding day to find their way to the venue and post photos that they take. While many existing wedding apps help brides and grooms plan things like seating arrangements, dress selections and registry creation, this app is a mobile aid for guests.

The situation is even worse in business class, says AlphaFlightGuru's Tim Gibson. He and I agree that the best use of frequent flyer miles is for international trips in business class, and here, he says, a typical traveler's initial success rate is less than 10 percent. His company (www.alphaflightguru.com) specializes in helping business travelers get the most from their miles, and he says his company can ultimately "help 80 percent of the people." But his agents really have to work at it, sometimes mixing and matching airlines within alliances or even use different alliances. But the strategy with the best odds of success, notes Gibson, is to wait to confirm seats until three to seven days prior to departure. That's the time when airlines finally decide how many seats they really aren't going to sell and release them for frequent flyers. Even when clients have to set firm travel dates well in advance, AlphaFlightGuru helps them by providing highly discounted consolidator tickets when the mileage awards don't become available.

Massie deals briskly with the increasingly younger and dumber favorites who succeeded Potemkin in Catherine's bed, though not in her government, noting that such arrangements were hardly unusual at the time. This is indeed a "Portrait of a Woman," as the subtitle declares, with plenty of attention paid to Catherine's emotions and psychology. It is also an adept portrait of a ruler, sympathetically assessing Catherine as a worthy successor to Peter the Great in the effort to modernize and westernize the vast Russian empire. Historians may wish Massie had devoted more time to underlying forces in Russian society that defined the limits of Catherine's achievements, but general readers will find this an absorbing, satisfying biography of the old school.

Since that first "gift" at age 30, I've tried every diet available. The grapefruit nightmare turned me into a sourpuss. After drinking ice water nonstop, all I got was brain freeze. And the cabbage soup diet - fat chance! Switching to a smaller plate only made me wonder if going back for seconds counted as exercise. Instead of speeding up my metabolism, green tea only sped up trips to the bathroom. In desperation I joined a fat club, but after three weeks all I lost was 21 days.

I'll be preaching this Sunday, which happens to be Mother's Day, but I won't be preaching about motherhood. I'll stick to the lectionary, and preach on the story of the disciples who encountered Jesus on the Road to Emmaus. When I mentioned this on Facebook, a friend wrote back that I don't need to preach about motherhood, because my presence in the pulpit says it all. That struck me, hard. I grew up in a church that does not ordain women, and while I am very grateful to that church in many ways, I do wonder how my life would have been different if I had had even one female role model in church.

DiNizio conducted the rest of the nostalgia trip himself. The frontman led the band through versions of the Who’s "Behind Blue Eyes" and the Youngbloods’ "Get Together," and reminded the crowd several times that his band had hung together for 31 years. He introduced each song clearly, often reporting the date it was recorded and the record label on which it was released.

What I knew was this: Every Mozingo in America probably descended from Edward Mozingo, a "Negro man" who lived in the Tidewater region of Virginia in 1644. I could trace myself only as far back as Spencer, who first showed up as a white adult in a 1782 census in the Piedmont, about 80 miles west. Who his parents were, whom he married, where he came from were mysteries.

“England Keep My Bones” is loaded with specifics: people Turner has met and landmarks on the map where he’s been, and sharply drawn characterizations of emotional memories he’s had.

Although the Band drew frequently on American Southern archetypes, Helm was the only authentic Southerner in the group (the rest of his mates were from Ontario.) With his scruffy beard, his blue eyes, and his weary dignity behind the kit, Helm looked like he'd stepped out of a Matthew Brady photograph from the Civil War.

Efron, who wears an "All glory is fleeting" tattoo on his back and a soulful look on his face, gets to be more of a grown-up in The Lucky One than in most of what he's done before, although he still seems callow in the company of the toothy, sun-streaming-through-her-hair Schilling. The actress casts moony eyes in Efron's direction with conviction, and goes through the various stages of a Sparks heroine (hurt, happiness, hurt, happiness, let's rip off some clothes and get down) with similar attention to the task.

Service is among the most focused I've seen at a casual restaurant. Ask for a wine suggestion and the waiter will probably lead you to an unusual bottle, which might be as little as $15. Plates are automatically changed out between courses, and servers treat everyone like their best customers. Attention to detail is evident, too, from the paintings on the walls to the photos and thick paper towels in the restrooms.
Perry and his husband, Leon (they married in Toronto), opened the Brown TLV Urban Hotel, with 30 designer rooms, less than a year ago. "The location is probably the best one in the city for gay nightlife, being within minutes from all major gay bars," says Perry.

Hotel amenities include free drinks and snacks, a rooftop sundeck and a spa with signature treatments, like the Brown Chocolate massage for two, with real chocolate.

"We are all for getting illegal bad guys off the street. But since the federal government refuses to give us the names of the supposed bad guys, we can't tell if it is true.

His hair was shaved down to stubble, and he had a thin goatee.
"There is still a strain of class resentment, a legacy of Cleveland's long history as a factory town. But since my return, I've never been embroiled in a strident political discussion or a show of unfriendliness.

Currently, the 6 percent contributions go into each employee's individual retirement account. These accounts are like the 401(k) defined-contribution plans held by most private-sector workers, with the employee taking all the market risk. They belong to public employees and will pay retirees benefits in addition to the generous pension benefits they get from the "general" PERS fund, which has a current unfunded liability of $7.8 to $13.3 billion, depending on how one does the math.
Freeman: Only new loans, right. Nobody's getting a rate cut on anything. And even on the new loans, going forward, it's not everybody. It's not all categories of student loans. But it's enough.

Findlay said the MOSERS board this summer would discuss whether to reduce those assumptions. Cutting them to 8 percent could cost state taxpayers as much as $30 million more per year starting 2014.

The races, too, are artfully, breathtakingly filmed, using Santa Anita Park as the principal set. There are undeniable riches here, but getting to the place where "Luck" really starts to pay off will require patience. That's not a good bet in a cable-drama universe crowded with quality choices. That makes this series, despite its obvious breeding, a long shot.

At the Ritz, Nucky barks out orders to butler Eddie Kessler (Anthony Laciura) and Ward Boss Damian Fleming (Victor Verhaeghe) for Mayor Bader's party. It's hilarious how he instructs "not to make a production of out it... He's not the Prince of Wales..."
Willis McGahee, RB, Broncos vs. Bengals. He and his teammates did little against the Raiders, but McGahee could have the backfield to himself against the Bengals if Knowshon Moreno's hamstring doesn't heal quickly. McGahee is always a good bet for goal-line carries, and he proved Monday night that he can be an effective receiver as well. He's a decent flex play this week if Moreno sits.
The Maplewood Richmond Heights School District was named one of three grand-prize winners in the American School Board Journal's and National School Boards Association's 18th annual Magna Awards program for Joe's Place.

Right now, as you ask questions of the people in positions of influence with this team, you understand that there isn't a plan in place. The plan was Oden and Roy and lots of backslapping. But that blew up in surgery. The half-court team that was supposed to grow into a formidable bunch now looks like it's too old in key spots, and too hobbled in others, to compete much longer.
OTHERS SAY: "Thetis Island is a hidden gem," says Deb Wilson of Sutton West Coast Realty. Greg Rowland of Sotheby's International Realty Canada in Victoria, who has the listing, thinks "they might have to wait awhile" to sell, but "it's a very unique and beautiful property."

Douglas Ready, an author and education professor at Columbia University, says many small schools that shared one campus found that their themes and programs could segregate students. Some schools in Boston, for example, found that high-income students migrated to certain themes. Once that trend started, other high-income kids tended to follow, regardless of theme. The schools also found that some themes attracted more whites, others more Latinos.

Newbie says: Scene from a barbecue restaurant: Waitress brings ribs. I take one. Sherpa takes one. "Pretty good," I say. "Not bad," Sherpa agrees. More bites. "I don't see what all the fuss is about," I say. "Me either," Sherpa concurs. For the first time during our "research," we leave food on the plates.

The Cleveland Browns were boldest. Less than an hour before the draft began, they engineered a trade with the Minnesota Vikings to move up one spot to pick No. 3.

If you have a topographical map, try a loop hike. Turn north into the sanguine walls and slick rock floor of Red Tanks Canyon, then northeast into Randolph Canyon, which curves eastward to the JF Trail.
