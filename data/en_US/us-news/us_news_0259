One was of Shea making necklaces and bracelets in the hobby room, and the other was of Shea fishing with her grandfather with a fishing rod in one hand and her cellphone in the other, texting.

If she wants to add a hometown twist, Jessica could do Rod Stewart's version of "Downtown Train," which was written and first recorded by Hilltop High School grad Tom Waits. Or she could play it safe and perform The Beatles "Let It Be" or Elton John's "Your Song," both of which would suit her very well.
"The shape was taken from some Italian lighting the architects saw," says Reilly. "We just made it a little flatter and bigger than they had." And they had to be blown so that more light would leak through at the bottom.
The newspaper describes Bartoli as "the great cheat" who has defrauded investors of $125 million. An Interpol representative told La Republica that Bartoli probably is living in rural Peru using a false passport.

Conditioning tax exemption for churches on refraining from speaking about certain things is just as dangerous as taxing churches outright. Those conditions break down the healthy "wall of separation between state and church" articulated by Thomas Jefferson in his letter to the Danbury Baptists. The conditions allow the state, through its discretion and power, to punish disfavored views and to reward favored ones. The free exercise of religion cannot survive in such conditions. The camel has had its nose under the flaps of the church tent for far too long. It's time to push him outside, where he belongs.
You can never rest on your laurels, and you have to get continually better with those things, Vermes said.
The economy is still problematic, but it’s not as suffocating as last year, said Frank Belluscio, spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association.

Mills has refused to identify his co-conspirators, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracy Berry said.
They didn't let up in the second, as they once again struck for three quick goals, all on the power play, in the first two minutes of the period. Ross potted his second of the game just 52 seconds into the frame, followed just 13 seconds later by Reid's second. Then 52 seconds after Reid's goal, Petan picked up the hat trick to put the Hawks up 8-1.

Two turnovers by David Perron - one in the neutral zone and one on a pass from behind the net - put the puck on the stick of the Bruins' Johnny Boychuk. His point shot was knocked down by Lucic and centered to Kelly for an open-net snap shot. At that point, Elliott, who entered the game with an NHL-best 1.56 goals-against average, had surrendered three goals on six shots.
Former University of Oregon golfer John Ellis and South Eugene High graduate Jeff Quinney also played in Murietta but withdrew before Saturday's final round.

Apart from the usual transportation, lodging and meal expenses, $50 for a floor seat at a Republican debate and $40 for a barbecue that was supposed to include U.S. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), it cost me nothing. Between events, there was time for meatloaf at the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester, a stroll under the turning leaves and tall church steeple in the town of Amherst; and a seaside lobster roll lunch at Harpoon Willy's in Portsmouth. And I haven't even begun to tell you what I learned about Social Security "regressivity."

Marylanders remember snow piled into mountains in parking lots two winters ago. This season, the white heaps are tons of rock salt stockpiled in the port and around the state to melt the missing snow and ice.
Stubbs' niece was in that house at the time of the shooting, and though neither she nor anyone else was injured, Fuqua sees the incident as just another sign of a city out of control.
Dunstan and officials holding more than one position in local government are responsible for monitoring what irons they can have in the same fire. It's a tricky balancing act.

"There was no one like Shifra," said artist and Cal State Northridge professor Yreina D. Cervantez. "She was an advocate and a scholar on Chicano and Chicana art long before it was recognized and … she put it in the context of the larger art world. Her commitment was unmovable and constant."

Weflen went on the TV program "Unsolved Mysteries." And after persuading an outdoor advertising dealer to donate space, saw to it that his wife's face graced 75 giant billboards from Canada to California, asking, "Have You Seen Julie Weflen?" and offering an $80,000 reward. Half the money was raised by BPA, half by Mike and Julie Weflen's families.
Don Yatkeman, who died Saturday, specialized in rehabbing city real estate in various states of disrepair. He was fixing up homes in the Central West End years before that part of town became trendy.

øComplicating matters, a significant number of 1099-Cs issued to taxpayers contain errors, says IRS Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson. To comply with Treasury regulations, some lenders issue 1099-Cs for debts they haven't tried to collect in 36 months, even if they haven't forgiven them, she says. In other cases, taxpayers have received duplicate 1099-Cs for the same debt, she says.
Part of the move to capped data is to get consumers accustomed to the idea that data isn't a limitless resource. If carriers didn't move to usage-based data plans while rolling out newer speedy data networks, the networks would get abused, Zachary Investment Research analyst Patrick Comack said. And while the pricing of Verizon's network is higher than AT&T's, its service is speedier, so it can charge a premium for now.
"We're excited that Romona is joining our team and she'll be playing a prominent role in our newscasts," Salamone said. "Denise is a very important part of our anchor team, and she will be called on to play a pivotal role."

The 81-year-old man entered a Placerville courtroom at 8:30 sharp Tuesday morning, eased into a spectator seat with his hand-carved cane, and softly declared:
If it takes having a dozen people sit around a table (hopefully without a bowl full of snacks) for a year to figure that out, so be it. For the rest of us, Dr. Kelly's report may well be a good reason to get an early start on a new year's resolution and have an apple instead of an apple pie when the choice presents itself.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- When a black bear climbed a tree in a central Arkansas city and refused to come down, authorities turned to unconventional rescue tools: bouncy houses.
"We noticed he was acting funny," said Pete Schenke, 17, the brother of the teen who took his life in April. "He wasn't the regular, outgoing, always-ready-to-do-stuff type of kid that he had been. It started to bother him more as time went by."

Alliance Democratic Rep. John Boccieri, an Air Force Reserve major who served in Afghanistan, said the U.S. must establish political stability in Afghanistan and Pakistan to keep the region's nuclear weapons from falling into terrorist hands.
As the investigation continued, Blakely told police she wanted to go home, then put her vehicle in drive and fled the scene, nearly running over Cacciabeve’s foot, according to Giuliani. The two officers pursued Blakeley and stopped her again at the intersection of Route 10 and Route 46.
"In many cases, you don't find out about the charges until you have walked in to pay and they've already put the gas in the car," said David Sugerman, a Portland lawyer representing Scharfstein. "And now, with prices so high, it's not like you have much choice. You were pulled in" by that lower posted price, he said. "It's sort of a gotcha."
What takes my breath away is the willingness of these people to spend tax dollars on something that makes no economic sense and they would never do with their own money.
Volume three, Master of the Senate, didn't arrive until 2002. It described how Johnson rose to power in the Senate and transformed that institution, securing the first civil rights legislation in nearly a century.

Instead, the legislation allows businesses to skirt the very penalties intended to discourage fraud. "Right to cure" would let a firm sued by a scammed consumer offer only a refund and nominal attorney fees.
The new service fits into a broader convergence trend. U.S. Special Operations forces are increasingly engaged in intelligence collection overseas and have collaborated with the CIA on missions ranging from the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan to ongoing drone strikes in Yemen.
More than 75 percent of Wagner's students live below the poverty line, but the school scores well above district average on state exams. Violence has dropped from 27 incidents in 2005-06 to 11 in 2009-10, for a rate decrease from 3.6 to 2. Single-school culture is a big part of that success, Johnstone said.

"Legend" is often overused, but the word truly does apply to Shaver. Johnny Cash described the Corsicana, Texas, native as his favorite songwriter. Kris Kristofferson has said Shaver may be the best ever to put pen to paper. The late Waylon Jennings became a star singing Shaver's songs.

"She was not a self-promoter. She cared about others and was extremely modest," he said. "Connie was unaffected by her prominence."
The shrimp? That can be jarring, too. The salt and pepper shrimp, lightly battered and fried, includes the tail, the thin but not so toothsome shell, and the head. You pick them up, plump as can be, and eat them. There's no peeling. You'll find the shell is a distraction the first 150 times you try it, but they're darn good once you are willing to shift your viewpoint.
Indeed, Intel credited the established knowledge base of its researchers Tuesday with drawing it back to Oregon for D1X.
Café Primavera was the first tenant in the back of the building, in the space now occupied by Siena Bistro.
Rows of tall turbines have already remade the landscape on wheat farms and ridgelines on private land around the region. But so far there have been no wind farms built on public land in the Northwest.
The treaty is an essential tool for dealing with today's security threats. The age of a superpower nuclear arms race is over. Instead, world leaders must focus on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to additional states, blocking advances in their nuclear weapons technologies -- and not letting nuclear weapons slip into the hands of terrorists.
To be sure, the United States does have a strategic anti-missile system. Interceptors now sit in their silos in California and Alaska. But the technology remains iffy  the last two tests have been failures  and these installations are oriented toward threats from the west, meaning North Korea. There's little coverage for missiles launched from the east.
Rubio has everything Romney seems to lack: charisma, the common touch, genuine humor, eloquence, and a record of consistent conservatism supplemented by an informed emphasis on foreign policy. Moreover, his joining the Republican ticket should energize Hispanic voters, including his fellow Cuban Americans, in the electorally important state he represents.

1. ACCELERATE COMMON STANDARDS. Most of our industrial competitors have rigorous national standards in education. The United States has a patchwork of largely inadequate standards whose expectations for student learning vary wildly depending on whether children live in Albany or Albuquerque. (This because, the joke goes, the right hates "national" and the left hates "standards.") The accountability regime set up by No Child Left Behind likewise left the design of standards to the states. The result has been what many consider a "race to the bottom," as states eased requirements to create the illusion of progress. State leaders have recently forged a consensus on a path to Common Core Standards in English language arts and mathematics.
Gensler long ago built close ties to Corzine -- and eventually worked for him -- as they rose through the ranks of Goldman Sachs. Later, they collaborated on Capitol Hill to pass an anti-corporate fraud law.
Voters in South Euclid last November approved rezoning 63 acres of the former Oakwood Country Club to allow big-box stores like Walmart.
Driven by public policy changes, U.S. prison populations have increased eightfold over the past four decades -- with little or no effect on crime rates. Mass incarceration has severed social networks, left one in 14 black children with a parent in prison, and created lifelong employment barriers for the 95% of prisoners who eventually return to their communities. Hundreds of thousands of young urban men grow up on blocks where going to prison has become a norm, maybe even an expectation.
The all-Stravinsky program began with conductor David Robertson leading the orchestra in the composer's arrangement of "The Star-Spangled Banner." Then it was down to business with "Petrushka." A program insert pointed out that this was the first of four programs this season that celebrate the Ballet Russes (Russian Ballet) whose groundbreaking productions lit up the artistic universe about 100 years ago. A synopsis of the story as well as still photos from the original 1911 production were projected on a screen over the orchestra.

In 2011, Scott Wolstein stepped down as executive chairman of DDR's board. Wolstein, the company's former chief executive, was employed by the company until July 1. His departure triggered nearly $8.6 million in payments. He also received a salary and matching contributions to retirement plans in 2011.
Pants often can be taken in to accommodate a smaller size because they have mostly straight seams, Gunn explains, but jackets and blazers are trickier for a tailor to fix if shoulder seams start to creep down the arm. Men especially have an issue with collars.
Also, low-cost carrier Spirit and regional carrier Allegiant Air have asked a federal court to block the new disclosure requirements, as well as several other consumer protections proposed in April. Southwest Airlines, which carries more passengers than any other domestic airline, has asked the court to block the government from requiring airlines to disclose taxes and government-required fees in their airfares. Southwest, which doesn't charge any ancillary fees, said including government required taxes and fees would force the airline to make complicated adjustments to its frequent flyer rewards program, which is based on airfares.
Things will be kept close to home on opening day, which the bar has dubbed "local bitterness" night, featuring India pale ales from nearby brewers such as Eagle Rock, Bootlegger, Smog City, Cismontane and Ladyface. Alex P. Davis helps oversee the bar's beer roster and said he'll be tapping a cask of Ladyface's Chesebro IPA on Feb. 15. Though it has a high alcohol content, the cask presentation should showcase the beer's sweeter side.
Role model: "Kerri Walsh is one of my biggest role models because she has accomplished so much despite people telling her differently."
Affton disincorporated in 1935, just two years after it was formed. A special state law provided for the disincorporation of Times Beach in 1985 as part of a dioxin cleanup project. Bridgeton absorbed Bridgeton Terrace in 1988 after the St. Louis Airport Authority bought and razed nearly all of Bridgeton Terrace.
The delegation spent two days in Afghanistan visiting with military and intelligence personnel in Kabul and rural areas around the country. Their visit overlapped with President Barack Obama’s surprise trip to announce a new accord with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, but Chambliss said no one in his group was invited to Obama’s events “even though we had a couple of Democrats with us.”
Pros: Sometimes the lilt of a new language can distance you from the worries back home. Then there are the stories, the humor, the handshakes. Travel is an education, and it all starts with chatting up the locals.
Riverview has found slipshod accounting practices and poor oversight of expenditures and payroll.

Doubles wins by Kelsie Sanborn and Losole, Caroline Eversman and Caitlin Railson, and Anna Hughes and Victoria Towers gave Notre Dame a quick 3-0 lead. A win in the singles made it 4-0 before Losole finisjed it out.
Only seven agencies satisfied all of the comptroller's benchmarks, which also included posting mission statements and lists of officials in charge: Mount Laurel Township Fire Department; Camden Housing Authority; Joint Insurance Funds for Atlantic County and Burlington County; Gloucester-Salem-Cumberland Joint Insurance Fund; and Improvement Authorities for Mercer County and Passaic County.
"It's crazy how the momentum changes. You feel like you're on top of the world and then you feel (terrible) after," Nagbe said. "It felt good scoring two goals, but I just wish we won the game."
A. I'm married to someone who grew up with Hank Sr. and Johnny Cash. Those were singers he liked, and my father-in-law was big into country music. He can't wait to see this movie, but I hope he's not disappointed (SPOILER ALERT FOR THE NEXT THREE WORDS) by the ending. (RESUME READING).

The real estate company, based in Cleveland, expects the deal to close by the end of the year. The new, two-year credit facility will be provided by 15 banks, 14 of which already were part of Forest City's bank group.
There are several area bed-and-breakfasts brimming with Southern hospitality, including the Beaumont Inn, built in 1845 and originally a school for young ladies and later known as the Daughters' College. Its popular eatery, the Old Owl Tavern, was named for the owner's Kentucky Old Owl Bourbon distilled along the Kentucky River before Prohibition.
The GOP's effort overall and in the six states in particular  Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina and Virginia  will focus on jobs and the economy, said the Republicans' top Hispanic outreach director, Bettina Inclan. But when Inclan was asked what the GOP would tell people about Romney's tough immigration talk, she demonstrated the party's chief weakness with Hispanic voters:
That is, the two of them will go to voters and say: Either approve mine or approve the other, but do something.

You can tell. The occasionally odd editing and the don’t-blink appearance of a number of actors (Will Arnett, Michael Shannon) hint at censored details and missing scenes. The arty padding (flashbacks, hallucinations and, finally, flashbacks within hallucinations) suggest a desperate editing-room attempt to make it all work.

Thursday's revelations provide some context as to why, during the trial's first two days, both the prosecution and defense seemed to focus more on the victim's widow, and her relationship with the Neuman, rather than on the man on trial.
Three major bipartisan efforts in Washington offered long-term solutions to our astronomical indebtedness, but none resulted in up-or-down votes in Congress that would have provided a measure of accountability for the folks at home.
The toughest part of that race - as if running approximately 1.5 miles wearing only one shoe wasn't tough enough - was the water jump near the end of each lap.

Jones will make a rare club appearance Saturday at Nighttown in Cleveland Heights, with shows at 8 and 10 p.m. The engagement happens to fall on his 67th birthday.
Now I've turned up another egregious case of official tolerance for taxpayer abuse. In winter 2005-06, $23 million worth of TV ads touting "preschool for all" appeared at the same time "preschool for all" initiative petitions were circulated. The ads were paid for by the First 5 state agency. It was created by a 1998 ballot measure orchestrated by Rob Reiner, who was also overseeing signature gathering for the preschool measure. The ads ended when the measure qualified and the three consultants who were paid $206,000 in public money to run the TV campaign immediately went to work for the proposition campaign.

I have always felt that the key to success in your profession is if you are broadening your understanding of the organization and you are taking on new challenges and you are continually learning through what are sometimes very difficult times. I wanted to make myself a better Coast Guard leader. All of what I was required to do to work through that significant change and then blend into the new unit was professionally enhancing. I think it helped keep me fresh and it provided me with a perspective I didn't have before. As I have moved up in my career, I think I have become more versatile and more useful to the Coast Guard because of the broadening I received during that assignment.

The details: It's only too easy to sneak Cabernet into Tuscan fare like Chianti. But the traditionally minded producer Montesecondo took the opposite approach - showing what Bordeaux grapes can do in Tuscan soil, unimpeded by the stylish winemaking that accompanies so much of the region's modern mind-set. Silvio Messana's biodynamically farmed Chianti estate includes plantings of Cabernet and Petit Verdot, which go into the 2009 Montesecondo Rosso del Rospo Toscana IGT ($25, 14%, Louis/Dressner Selections). Aged in steel tank, it shows beautiful loam and briar accents that radiate Chianti's calcareous terroir - through a different grape.

There was really no downside to the proposed hotel. It is really a shame that uninformed residents under the banner “Beachwood Residents for Responsible Development” didn’t do their homework and were either misinformed of the real estate office market or unaware of the benefits to the city of Beachwood.

A. Funny you should ask because I actually have no idea. That’s the beauty of it all — you don’t have to keep track and no one else is keeping track either. Maybe four weeks?

The proclamation is a request, not a demand, the appeals court said. The president frequently calls on citizens to do things they prefer not to do, possibly on religious or political grounds, the court said.

As an example of just how phony the surcharge is, let's take a closer look at the figures. The fine print says that the price of a "land only" hotel/touring package, without any airfare, is $1,099. Subtract the land only price from the supposed land-plus-air price and you're left with $100 as the base airfare. Now, do you, does the tour operator, or does anybody else really think that if the price of fuel dropped from the present figure around $3 a gallon back to the 1979 to 2005 range around $1 a gallon, Air France would actually sell you a round-trip from Newark to Paris for $100? The sad part of this scam is that the real fare, of $520, is a good deal, without any trickery.

The received wisdom so far has been that Town Halls are better for McCain because he can loosen up and relax and make direct contact with what are nowadays called "real people."

Katherine can't say that Mark wants her to "shake her naughty bits" without dissolving into some very charming laughter. All this talk of the "sexy" moves Mark wants to put into their jive makes me worry that Len is going to haaaate it. They have a whole craps table on the dance floor for the start of their routine. And the lights are flashing slot machine symbols on the floor throughout their routine, while screens show slot spins behind the stage - it's all so very busy, but the song, Robert Randolph and the Family Band's "Ain't Nothing Wrong with That" is going on my playlist and soon. At the end of the routine they throw around some of the chips from the table. So much "extra business."

The mere existence of this parallel world, just across the border - a "mongrel metropolis" thronged by raucous crowds and thumping to the syncopated beat of mariachi music and trick car horns and come-ons from girlie-show barkers, yet somehow shadowed by an ineffable, pre-Columbian sadness - taught me that much of what I was told was "normal" and "right" was in fact culturally relative and historically contingent.
More than 50 people spoke at the hearing on the Rowan campus in Glassboro, most of whom were affiliated with Rutgers-Camden and vehemently opposed the merger. In a familiar refrain, they said they were attracted to Rutgers because of its reputation as a world-class research institution.

Matta did tweak his rotation, playing backup point guard Shannon Scott for 22 minutes after he didn't play him at all against Michigan State. He used Scott often with starting point guard Aaron Craft, as well. That was unusual, but Matta wanted to get another player on the court to attack on offense and create more open shots. Scott missed all five of his attempts, but he did have four assists. It's a look that could help as the postseason approaches, but Tuesday the Buckeyes were already up, 15-4, when Scott came in with 15:25 left in the first half.

"It would be much less of a controversy if the treatment was just given to CAH girls," said Heino Meyer-Bahlburg, professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University Medical Center and a prominent researcher on disorders of sexual development in children.

"There is nothing, Mike, you can identify that you would have done. . . that would have furthered the game or advanced the ball," Cordray shot back, noting that the federal investigation was underway long before he took office. "They didn't really want state or locals involved because they really weren't sure where all of this led. I've conducted myself so as to be useful to these investigations, not to grandstand or score political points."
During a meeting Misher attended in the 1990s, Synthes executives were discussing whether to develop a new product that might not bring in large profits. Wyss stopped the discussion and asked whether patients needed it. The answer was yes, so Wyss told his team to go ahead, Misher said.
In Wailea, the Fairmont Kea Lani's Ko restaurant, for example, now serves its own purified sparkling and still water in reusable glass bottles, which decreases the use of plastic bottles, the energy used in shipping bottles and the waste created from packaging. In Kaanapali, Honua Kai is already known for its stewardship of marine life such as the honu (sea turtle) and native birds that frequent its restored wetland pond, the only one of its kind on a Maui resort. Now it's turning its sights to the uninhabited island of Kahoolawe, which was deforested by ranching and long used as a military bombing site. Working with the Kahoolawe Island Reserve Commission, the resort will begin a reforestation project on the rugged island in May.

Now that the petition is filed, TriMet's Board of Directors will research the impact of a withdrawal on the area. Then they'll hold a public hearing and make a decision. Fetsch said there's no way to tell exactly how much is paid to TriMet from Boring businesses. The budget for the bus is $135,000 per year, and the door-to-door paratransit service costs $256,000, which works out to about $30 per ride given.

Barring a 25 percent property tax hike, what would be that largest in the past two decades, neither the council nor the mayor offered any detailed alternative plans to get revenues on to the city’s books by December. If the money isn’t found by then, the city risks an unbalanced budget which could result in the state interceding, enacting its own layoffs and raising taxes as they see fit.

After scrambling to find continuity on their offensive line because of injuries in 2011, the Bears will have plenty of competition at guard heading into training camp.

Chris Spencer replaced Louis at right guard and started the last 14 games.

If not for NJIT, the Hawks would hold the distinction of the state’s worst team. After a shaky start, Dave Calloway’s team sank on the back of a 4-10 finish. But the offseason brought worse news as four players — including star Travis Taylor — left the program. One, Justin Sofman, quit because he couldn’t take the "culture of negativity." Ouch.
I'll conclude by saying that it may not be appropriate to refer to the Republican slate as a joke. I'm sorry I take it back -- they are, more fittingly, pathetic. In times like this there is nothing wrong with the nation having a good laugh, just as long as it's not at the expense of a major political party. The 1980 field in comparison to 2012 reminds me of the recent LSU vs. Florida game.
