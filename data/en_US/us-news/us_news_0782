Fox, which is releasing the film internationally, is hopeful that the movie will be a hit abroad, because theaters were sparse in many countries when the original debuted 15 years ago. For instance, when "Titanic" opened in Russia in 1998, it played in only 32 theaters and grossed $5.1 million. By comparison, "Titanic 3-D" was screened in 10 times as many Russian locations and made $4.9 million — 97% of the original's lifetime gross in the country. Yet despite the seemingly impressive figure, Russian moviegoers responded more positively to the naughty antics of the "Reunion" guys than "Titanic 3-D," as the comedy sold $5.1 million worth of tickets there.

Take, for example, the figure of a mounted, armored knight with an angry stare atop a 27-foot-tall pedestal in Newark’s Lincoln Park. Art historians would recognize it immediately: It is a replica of the Bartolomeo Colleoni monument in Venice, Italy, dedicated to a Renaissance condotierre (mercenary) who left 260,000 gold ducats to the republic if its leaders would erect an equestrian statue in his honor. Since equestrian statues, even in bronze, cost much, much less than that, the Venetians, predictably, agreed.

Of course no show about degradation and the body would be complete without the work of Chris Burden, represented here by documentation of classic performances in which he crucified himself on a car, had himself shot in the arm, and lay naked on the floor with flaming sheets of glass propped on his shoulders. However, when seen as figurative art, his work comes across as more vulnerable than macho, making it oddly sympathetic with the work of some of his feminist contemporaries. Conversely, the show provides a welcome broader context for works by Chicago, Buchanan, Barbara T. Smith and Carole Caroompas, in which the general frailty and mutability of the human body emerges alongside specifically feminist concerns.

The film's 144-minute running time gives a sense that the filmmaker couldn't let a single frame fall to the cutting room floor. Mr. Macdonald's new documentary is neither as polished nor—unavoidably, given the subject—as powerful as "One Day in September," his Oscar-winning account of the Palestinian terrorist attack on the Israeli team at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. Still, too-muchness is no sin, and no one can accuse "Marley" of not-enoughness.

South Korea would allow the U.S. to lift a 2.5 percent tariff on Korean cars in five years, instead of cutting the tariff immediately. The agreement would let each U.S. automaker export 25,000 cars to South Korea as long as they met U.S. safety standards. The U.S. could continue a 25 percent tariff on trucks for eight years and phase it out by the 10th year. South Korea would be required to eliminate its 10 percent tariff on U.S. trucks immediately.

"People that wonder how Kobe Bryant would have handled this have short memories. He strung everyone along before his opt-out summer of 2004, just as LeBron did. He had the Bulls, Knicks and Clippers come meet him, just as LeBron had teams meet him. (Although at least Kobe's pursuers got to go to Newport Beach instead of Cleveland). Two year later, Kobe changed his number, just as LeBron will next year. So it's a mistake to say Kobe wouldn't have done it the way LeBron did it. He has. He also went on radio to demand a trade, then appeared on another show to retreat from that position, then charged forward again in a different radio appearance. That was followed by the secretly taped parking-lot conversation in which he took swipes at teammate Andrew Bynum and Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak. Kobe didn't use technology; technology used him.''

"I appreciate the professionalism demonstrated by two law enforcement agencies, IMPD and MCSO, in dealing with this most unfortunate situation. Investigators from both agencies are working with the Coroner's Office to ascertain the cause of death. The Deputies that were involved were placed upon administrative leave with pay until the investigation is complete. This is standard procedure. I have tremendous respect for the men and women of law enforcement who work extra duty. They as well as those on full duty help keep our community safe, and many times they are directly in harms way. For example, of the ten Marion County Sheriff's Deputies who have lost their lives in the line of duty, three were working extra duty at the time they were slain. I keep those fallen Deputies in my prayers, and I shall also keep the Butler family in my prayers. Every life is precious."
His paintings craft a perceptual void.

After all, Rubio is young (40), attractive, articulate and smart. I interviewed him last year and found him well versed on national and international policy, and quite capable of framing his "tea party" ideology in relatively moderate tones.

Smart distribution grids could generate zero-emission and high-efficiency power and integrate wind and solar at low cost. All of the new demand for electricity could be met by increasing efficiency.

Favorite book: "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius" by Dave Eggers because the narrator isn't afraid to be honest. He is bitter about losing both parents to cancer, and sometimes wishes he wasn't left with the responsibility of raising his brother. But what makes it a good book, in my opinion, is that although he admits to having those feelings, he loves his brother more than anything else. His love is stronger than any of the sacrifices he has to make while coming to terms with the loss of his parents.

I'm amazed by the writer who claims that extending in-state tuition to the children of illegal immigrants will do no good because they can't ever work in Maryland. He needs to read the Maryland Dream Act. One of the conditions of receiving in-state tuition is applying for citizenship. Which is the very thing that the writer complained about, namely illegal immigrants busting in line ahead of those on the pathway to citizenship.

Just as the Secret Service trails the president at all times, New Jersey's governors are constantly protected by a state police detail. During the 1993 governor race, Republican Christie Todd Whitman pledged to sell the state helicopter, promising to travel the state solely by road. She did not after winning, however. Her successor, Democrat Jim McGreevey, had the state Democratic Party reimburse the state for personal use of the chopper during his brief term. Jon Corzine, who Christie defeated in 2009, personally paid for use of helicopters to travel the state.

It was like a scene from "Omega Man," the sci-fi movie in which Charlton Heston is the last (normal) soul on the planet. As he drives through a deserted metropolis, he goes into offices where time has seemingly stopped, forever � work still piled up on desks, the coffee pot still plugged in, even the odd skeleton - all of it illuminated only by the defused early morning sunlight streaming through dusty windows. That's exactly what the old Star newsroom looked like � a maze of mismatched metal desks no one would ever return to piled high with yellowing newspapers and phone books, stuff spilling into the aisles, electrical cord strung like trip wire. Everything but a dead city editor propped up in his chair. We have a reporter in here?

Language on the back explains that the wine is called claret to honor the heritage of wines made by Captain Gustave Niebaum from grapes grown in his California vineyards dating to 1910.

Now it sounds like I’m defending the emcee on social or literary grounds, which is just about the last thing Tyler would want: he’s trying to make provocative records without redeeming social value. He wants to render you incapable of turning off his voice, even as you’re pissed off and squirming in discomfort. He plays evil: He’s a nihilist, peddling the thrill of contamination. That’s the sales strategy, and it’s one that’s working well for him.

The initiative would impose a quarter-cent sales tax increase and increase income taxes on those earning more than $250,000 a year. But higher tax rates discourage economic development and motivate high-earners to shield income, offsetting hoped-for revenue increases.
How was it, shooting in Hagerstown?
In November, Martin Weiss, a longtime talent manager who specialized in representing young actors, was arrested on suspicion of child molestation.

What would you say if Heckert asks you if you want Hillis back? “Again, I think it’s important that we investigate everything and again, it’s like our players, Tom’s comments and my comments we’ll keep those private. We’ve got to have a couple things that everybody doesn’t know about (joking). Although, you folks do a good job of finding out the answers.”
like Scoot & Doodle, Google is cribbing a page from Facebook. When CEO Mark Zuckerberg opened Facebook's platform to independent developers in 2007, no one knew it would trigger a revolution in social games that spawned successful companies like Zynga. More recently, Facebook also has offered shared-experience services, such as a feature launched in January that allows friends to listen to the same song at that same time. Facebook has also partnered with Skype to provide video chat.
BEIJING—A Chinese Communist Party leader who led a revival of Maoist ideology was removed from his post as leader of a southwestern mega-city after Premier Wen Jiabao dealt him an unusual public rebuke, exposing deep rifts within the party elite ahead of a once-a-decade leadership change this fall.

Orange County comptroller Martha Haynie read scripted introductions to the scenes (and a rotation of evening gowns showed she's ready for a red carpet).
Of course, coaching in Corvallis, Ore., where the Beavers have missed two consecutive bowl trips, is a little different than coaching in Indianapolis, where the Colts won the 2007 Super Bowl. College players have a handful of other responsibilities — like school — and time limits on practice. They’re also teenagers, which can cause a few headaches, though Perry is quick to point out with a laugh that “they’re some teenagers in that league too but here, they’re teenagers who listen.”
The board determined that a "significant delay" had passed between Chen's adverse reaction and the 911 call. It also said Rutland had "failed to recognize lidocaine toxicity," didn't begin resuscitative measures quickly enough, and that the facility was inadequately equipped to deal with an emergency.
Caribou posted net earnings for the quarter of $1.2 million, or 6 cents per share, down from $24.1 million, or $1.17, a year ago. However, 2011's first-quarter earnings included a $21.3 million tax benefit. Caribou's first-quarter revenue was $80.5 million, up 11.4 percent.
That we're consuming artificial sweeteners is clear. Whether we'll ever do so with total ease is not. Suspicions about the safety of man-made sweeteners started soon after saccharin was invented more than a century ago. Studies, later disputed, led to warning labels on one sweetening product, the banning of another, intermittent mistrust of others.
That’s because director George Miller has returned for this effort, and as eclectic as his résumé is — he did both “Mad Max” and “Babe: Pig in the City” — there’s still a kind of hippie through line in his work, touching on everything from vegetarianism to ecology and fascinated by the balance between community needs and individual ambitions.
A friend mentioned that there is a medicine to take for alcoholism. What is it?
The settlement does not affect the ongoing lawsuit against the Mortgage Law Group, which Searns said his firm will continue to fight.

Ritz management did not return phone calls Tuesday asking for comment.
While the Sharks won 54 percent of the draws in Game 3, they lost seven of 11 "critical" faceoffs -- those in the defensive zone while killing penalties or in the offensive zone while on the power play.
Allison may be, behind her façade of professional accomplishment, one more child about to have a child, but having her child is a given; she never considers abortion as an option. (The birth scene is both stirring and shocking.) Ben may be, behind his slob exterior, a hapless boor and a quintessential slacker -- he and his goony buddies are trying, in their cyberspace-cadet fashion, to put together a soft-core Web site -- but he's also tender, gentle, and vulnerable, an overgrown, under socialized boy with a touching potential for commitment and growth.

Their 2012 draft class showed us, really, what they believe in as they rebuild and reorganize the Raiders in the post-Al Davis universe.
The new motor makes a healthy 155 horsepower to give this car zip, yet it has also been finessed to get the most out of the gasoline that feeds it. By using multi-hole fuel injectors for optimal combustion and a newly shaped piston cavity, the 2.0-liter four-cylinder has helped this car attain the magic "40 mpg" number, in this case for highway. City mpg is rated by the EPA at 28 mpg.
Vitt, who will be coach Sean Payton's replacement for the 2012-13 season after Payton was suspended for the entire season, did confess the team had a pay-for-performance program for big plays. All non-contract bonuses are against NFL rules.

The NHL’s judge and jury obviously already had decided before Friday’s sham of a hearing that Duncan Keith would not be suspended for more than five games despite having thrown a concussion-inducing elbow to Daniel Sedin’s head on Wednesday night, so how in good conscience could the vice president of player safety feign objectivity entering Friday’s alleged fact-finding mission before in fact handing down — what else? — a five-game sentence to the Chicago defenseman?
FBI agents this morning searched the home of Deandre Lane, father of 2-year-old Bianca Jones, the missing toddler who reportedly was taken during a carjacking last week, the Free Press has learned.
So here's a modest proposal. Instead of simply condemning the alternative-route programs -- or trying to compensate for their deficiencies with tack-on evening courses -- why don't education schools offer recruits a full year of training before they start on the job?

A federal jury found Bryant solicited a job at the School of Osteopathic Medicine in Camden County and used his influence to help the school acquire $10.5 million in state grants. It also found him guilty of mail and wire fraud stemming from the scheme to land the $35,000-a-year “low-work” job at the school and boost his pension. He is serving a four-year sentence in West Virginia. The state pension board recently voted to revoke his $83,688 annual pension.

The Times reported that Father Champagne received "psychiatric counseling after being accused of fondling a boy in 1979," and resigned in 2002 when the same accusation was made again.
The fact the Epstein deal hasn't been closed reveals the naivete of the Cubs' management team, specifically president Crane Kenney. A major-league source said Kenney has bragged since September that he is leading this process, despite claims from Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts that the former Tribune Co. executive wouldn't be involved.
"By combining this charged word with 'pension' in the title, all in capital letters, the city council has implicitly characterized the existing pension system as defective, wrong, or susceptible to abuse, thereby taking a biased position in the very titling of the measure itself," the justices wrote. The city instead should use "Pension Modification," they added.
But, in the second quarter of 2010, sales bounced back to nearly the same level as 2008. Paul Crum said demand has returned across the board, in industries such as automotive, construction and oil and gas. Timken supplies manufacturers in those and other sectors with specialty steel that is engineered to withstand heavy extremely heavy loads.
"We've seen nothing with obesity that compares to how we've addressed the H1N1 flu in terms of the amount of resources and . . . effort," he said. "What the results call for is an even greater priority placed on the problem -- so that hopefully things will start to turn back."
He said the grants from the highway safety office have been vital.
"Patient is sedated," Rosenow wrote. "He is in a cervical collar. He does not open his eyes. He does not follow commands. He will localize painful stimuli with his left upper extremity. He will withdraw his right upper extremity. He will move both his legs symmetrically to stimulation."
"I’m not sure if it was because I’m a girl and they are guys as much as they had been here longer than me," said Beveridge, 20. "I think the more I started paddling out and catching some waves, the more I was respected. It’s all about earning your respect."

"Statistical information provided to City Hall management to demonstrate the success of the (Unified Call Taking) project contained errors and does not provide a clear picture of the effectiveness of UCT related business processes," the report said.

The focus remains on Jews, and Central Florida isn't exempt. In early June, the Anti-Defamation League released a report called "Extremism in Florida: The Dark Side of the Sunshine State." It listed a half-dozen kook groups right around here that advocate extermination of Jews and noted that a St. Cloud member of the neo-Nazi skinhead group called American Front pleaded guilty last year to vandalizing a Jewish synagogue in Norfolk, Va.
Farmers who expressed serious concerns about land use issues in our county are being kept from serving on a rural roads advisory committee.

And speaking of Democrats, the surprising shining star of the night was Robert Rush, even though he got off to a rough start.
For once in the more than 3-year-old county corruption case, Dimora is playing second fiddle to a defendant facing more serious racketeering charges. Forlani, ex-president of the former Doan Pyramid Electric company, is charged in the 18-count indictment with operating a continuing criminal enterprise in cahoots with Dimora.
When those revelations first appeared in print, they sparked outrage and soul searching. How could we allow this to happen, especially so soon after the Legislature dramatically toughened penalties for drunk driving in 2005?
On job creation, I challenge President Obama's opponents to come forward with a plan that creates at least 1.9 million jobs without adding to the budget deficit. So far, that hasn't happened. I have urged the supercommittee to make sure that job creation is included in its list of recommendations. I also have urged the panel's members to put aside partisan differences and come up with a plan that is bold, comprehensive and balanced — or, as some would say, a plan that involves "shared sacrifice."

That may have come as a bit of a surprise to Republicans in Washington who have taken a more skeptical view of the student loan program. Mr. Romney had already wholeheartedly endorsed Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan, which contains no provision for keeping the lower rate. Apparently, he didn't mean he liked the whole thing (or read the fine print), or perhaps he changed his mind.
“He always had the potential, he was just in back of some pretty good football players,” Perez said. “In the offseason, he took advantage of our weight program. … Moving him from outside linebacker to defensive end was a big difference. He became a very athletic defensive end.”

Nilaja Sun portrayed dozens of characters — and herself — when telling of her experiences teaching an inner city 10th grade class. “They’ve had five different teachers in seven months,” she said ruefully. But they also endured physical, emotional and sexual abuse in their 16-year-old lives — and Sun didn’t shy away from telling about all of it.
And it easily beat out the previous auction record for Munch, also held by Sotheby's. In 2008, the auction house sold the 1894 Munch painting "Vampire," a melodramatic image of a red-haired, bare-armed woman kissing a man's neck, for about $38 million.

Shalom Park is kosher all the time, supervised by a team of mashgiachs who make sure the kitchen staff (not all of them Jewish) and the foods they serve adhere to Jewish dietary laws. One of those laws, the separation of meat and dairy, comes from three passages in the Torah, commanding not to "boil a kid in its mother's milk."
According to Sören Stark, ISAW's expert on Altaic or Turco-Mongolian matters, we can begin by classifying the nomad culture as sui generis—not hunter-gatherers, sedentary urbanites, farmers nor seagoing folk. Their horse-borne mobility allowed them to range widely, but real expansion began around 1000 B.C. with the development of mounted archery. "The show reveals an early moment of globalization with cross-cultural influences, the early Silk Road perhaps," Mr. Stark says. "The tribes were a little cosmopolitan, perhaps not as monocultural or monoethnic as the popular perception goes. In fact, over time, it seems that the elites broke tribal limits and gathered retinues from outside." He is reluctant to infer too much from the evidence, but he feels that "the recurrent animal motifs, purely animal with no humans in the picture," suggest a religious cosmology of animal worship. Shamanism? Perhaps.

OSU player who must be locked down: Still Deshaun Thomas. I don't know if Thomas said it or not -- because I didn't hear him say it -- but a Kansas TV reporter told the Jayhawks' Thomas Robinson that Thomas implied he would be too quick for Robinson. Robinson, who talks like Batman, sounded peeved. "He said he's too quick for me?" Robinson asked. "Nah. I don't think he's too quick for me. I don't think he's nowhere near quicker than me."

Turner, a former Cleveland city councilman and the clerk for more than 14 years, appears as comfortable as a happy monarch. He collects a public pension worth about $60,000 a year while receiving about $95,000 for his current work.

The first quarter is a seasonally weak one for contract-based plans, and the industry is likely to show some subscriber additions for the whole of the year.

Sprint Nextel Corp., No. 3 in size, has mostly lost subscribers, while No. 4 T-Mobile has done so consistently. That poses a conundrum for regulators who want to preserve vibrant competition in the industry.

While you're scanning Dutch-born decorative painter Willem Racké's credentials - more than two decades' worth of impressive feats of gilding, wood graining and Venetian plastering in Bay Area homes, hotels and restaurants - your eyes lock on a few iconic San Francisco destinations, and you realize that as a cultured urbanite, you've unknowingly been in the presence of the artist's work.

Maryland already has a progressive tax structure, and I never spoke out against that structure. It is fair to have a debate about the best rates within that tax structure. But what transpired on the floor of the Senate went far beyond an economic debate and policy question. In an attempt to "stick it" to the high-earners, the Senate didn't just adopt a new rate. The Senate adopted a provision, for the first time in Maryland's history, where the tax on high-earners would be applied to every dollar they earn, unlike every other tax bracket. The effect of that provision would be that an individual making $500,001 would pay close to double the tax of an individual paying $500,000. One dollar more in earnings costs close to $3,000 in taxes. That, of course, makes no sense, which is why the Baltimore Sun, in its editorial "Tax policy on the fly" (March 19), roundly criticized that same provision. But in Mr. Rodricks' world of inflexible party-first politics, does it not matter whether something makes sense at all?

Now, it would be one thing if the population of Ohio happened to be distributed in a way that made Democratic districts difficult to form. And, indeed, for the last two decades, some voices have tried to suggest that that's the party's problem. They've said that Democrats are too heavily concentrated near big cities. So, this theory goes, the Democrats face an overwhelmingly high number of districts in which they have no chance, while they get a few districts in which they have overwhelming control.

In trying to plan a meal for almost 200 guests that would be exciting, whimsical, and most importantly delicious, we decided on something a little controversial. Perhaps it is just me, but my favorite food offerings at any wedding I have ever attended are the passed hors d’oeuvres during cocktail hour. Something about a perfectly packaged amuse-bouche served from a glistening, silver tray evokes the feeling that you are somewhere special. This led us to the decision to forgo the 90 minutes of boring salads and dry chicken for a dinner entirely comprised of passed small bites. To avoid hunger and confusion from the guests who have never experienced this before, food will be served in four waves with four options, each progressing from light to heavy as the night, and consumption, go on. Just thinking about it is making me giddy with anticipation.

Nobody in this sweet-natured, low-testosterone trifle is out for blood. Hall gives an agreeable portrayal of a man-child not unlike David Fisher, his character on "Six Feet Under."

Aspell said there's a name for what she does - urban exploration, the recreational reconnaissance of urban sites off limits to the public. The internet has helped turn local curiosities and provincial oddities into regional, even national hot spots, with websites and YouTube travelogues devoted to moldering mansions, abandoned prisons, forsaken factories, forgotten infrastructure and industrial detritus - and the creepier, the better.

"I think it's a little bit frustrating some times," Jonathan Ericsson said. "I think some are really kind of weak calls. We just have to not worry about that, because we can't do anything about it. But of course, it's a little bit frustrating with the inconsistency of some calls. We slashed the stick and it's laying there and the stick doesn't even break. They do the same thing to Mule, but no call is made. I think it's a little bit inconsistency from the refs."
This time, there are a series of deadlines this year, starting with the CVC's mandate to deliver a plan by Feb. 1. The Rams could counteroffer and would have to do so by May 1.

An arbitrator can't force the CVC to fund improvements to the Dome but can determine whether the plans pushed by either side - or a combination of the two - would make the Dome a first-tier stadium.

If your new goal in life is to join the United Auto Workers (saved by Mr. Obama with your parents' taxes) or work for a government agency somewhere for the next 40 years, the president is your candidate. The modern Democratic Party from top to bottom is the party of all unions, hardly different than the European political parties whose union members and unemployed college graduates filled city squares Tuesday in forlorn May Day demonstrations. If a career inside an American union is what it's all about, then an Obama vote ("Forward") is a no-brainer.

It's easy to forget how confounding the events of that spring were for Los Angeles. Angry mobs of blacks chose targets by the color of their skin and Asians were not getting a pass, mainly because of tensions surrounding Korean American store owners in the historically African American neighborhoods of South L.A.
