When asked for advice he'd give to aspiring designers, Gunn says, "I always say to young people, you need to be a barometric gauge of your society and culture.

A U.S. official says Washington is trying to help the blind Chinese activist who took refuge in the U.S. Embassy and then left under what the activist now says was pressure from the U.S.
But it's probably bad sociology and terrible psychology, given the general disgust with conventional politics. If I were in the campaigns, I'd want to detach from the current rules of engagement and change the nature of the campaign. If I were Obama, I'd play to his personal popularity and run an "American Idol" campaign. If I were Romney, saddled with his personal diffidence, I'd run a plumber campaign.

The festival — named after Williams’ indie record label, whose "Potatoe" is intentionally misspelled in honor of former vice president Dan Quayle’s infamous 1992 gaffe — takes place outdoors at the museum, on two stages. One uses a picturesque limestone quarry as its backdrop, the other overlooks the south branch of the Raritan River. About 500 to 800 people usually attend, per day.
At first glance, the measure appears strict: It would reduce the overall amount of time a lawmaker can serve in Sacramento from 14 years to 12. And its greatest political selling point is it wouldn't benefit any current politicians, unlike two previous initiatives that voters rejected.
In his record 46 years on the job, he's never faced a crisis quite like the one now hovering over Happy Valley like a dark cloud. While other programs were plagued by controversy after controversy -- Ohio State and Miami this year, for instance -- Penn State, one of the storied programs in the college football history, seemingly just rolled right along with about as much buzz as their plain blue-and-white uniforms, holding true to its slogan "Success with Honor."

"Tonight we didn't count on him completely," Doan said. "We actually made it so he had a little bit of breathing room instead of having to be perfect."
The notion of penning so many letters is almost unfathomable in an age of electronic communication. For O'Keeffe and Stieglitz, who spent a great deal of time apart, writing was essential to keeping up with each other's art work, daily activities, emotional swings and sexual yearnings. And write they did, in a more or less stream-of-consciousness style with lots of dashes.
The identified relatives likely just scratch the surface — only about 10 percent of the region's nearly 300 districts were investigated and usually only employees with the same last names as board members were examined.

The Fed regularly reviews its bond-purchase program. It could buy fewer securities if the economy were to grow more strongly than anticipated or if inflation showed signs of breaking out. Or it could buy more if the economy was in danger of weakening. Most economists believe the Fed will spend the full $600 billion on schedule.
Also, consistency being key, on my next visit I order the house beef-blend burger, mixed with Chicago Style Steakhouse spice (which I'm now dubbing eau de Gene & Georgetti); it's delivered medium-well with only a touch of pink. So while I appreciate the offer to grill to my desires, the ability to meet that demand still needs some work.
Like any proud Peruvian (well, halvsies), I can't get through a conversation about the country without waxing nostalgic about my favorite foods: conchitas a la parmesana (scallops baked in Parmesan cheese), lenguado con mantequilla negra y alcaparras (sole sauteed in black butter with capers), ceviche de pescado (chunks of fresh fish "cooked" in the acid of key limes) — all eaten, preferably, beach-side while getting drowsy on pisco sours.
Creagh said 137 scouts and about 30 adults are participating this week as part of a series of one-week sessions. He said that workers have checked for other damaged trees and that this group will stay for the rest of the week.
And with that, the governor sat at his desk, and signed his name. "We have a bill," he said to instant applause.
Current situation: Builders got swamped when the wave finally broke. Some firms failed or had to reorganize. On Wall Street, homebuilders got slammed, with a Dow Jones index of home-construction stocks losing 70 percent of its value since its inception in May 2006. But industry employment hasn't suffered as much as predicted because commercial and public projects have taken up some slack.

And if you're a farmer, whose commodities are helping fuel Brazil's export boom, you'd better count on up to a third of your harvest falling out of trucks navigating bumpy old roads on the way to market. Then you might wait for days at overwhelmed ports to unload the rest.

The final vote came after a day of high drama and a weekend of intense lobbying by Gov. Mark Dayton and the team, and produced a relatively easy 73-to-58 approval in the House. Though Republicans hold a majority in the House, DFLers did the heavy political lifting on the final vote, producing 40 of the 73 votes. The victory was also noteworthy because House Speaker Kurt Zellers -- the leading Republican in the House -- voted against the project.
U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, who’s up for reelection next year, 43 percent positive to 34 percent negative approval rating. But when put up against an unnamed Republican candidate, he beats him or her 47 percent to 35 percent.

MetroHealth's Chief Executive Mark Moran announced in December that he would not renew his contract. The news came after a year he called particularly "tough." His four-year tenure has included a overhaul of the management staff and operations, layoffs and, most recently, struggles to keep the health system's finances in the black.
I don't like 14 years of losing any more than anyone else. I'd like Cal Ripken Jr. to own the team, too. The bad news is that Peter Angelos is still the owner, but the good news is that I don't think that Mr. Angelos has had his fingerprint on this team since the hiring of Andy McPhail. He finally learned to let the baseball people make the decisions and do their jobs.

Local investigative reporting is the heart of our mission, and the Chicago Tribune is doing more of it than ever before. You expect us to hold our leaders and institutions to a high standard of competence and honesty.

No punter has been drafted as high as the third round since the Chiefs took Dustin Colquitt with the 99th overall pick in 2005. Ray Guy remains the hero of every punter 39 years after the Raiders made him the only player at his position to be drafted in the first round.
A few minutes later during a backstage interview, Lynn hailed Lambert: “Nobody in country music is more country than Miranda.”
As directed by Sara Staley, using a revised, more compact script than the '09 version, it seems fairly haphazard if well-meaning at first. The set looks hastily thrown together (the easier to tour with, perhaps). The eight-person semi-pro cast doesn't deliver as in-depth characters or nuanced line readings as did the high-power Rep ensemble (after only one short rehearsal).

"John Q" (2002): And another man pushed to the brink, this time by a more contemporary foe -- the insurance company that won't cover his son's heart transplant. So his character, John Quincy Archibald, takes a hospital emergency room hostage until he can get his son's name on the transplant list. Not a critical favorite, which is somewhat rare for a Washington movie.

This has all been tried before. The fuel economy standards that got us to the current 29.6 mpg were supposed to free us from OPEC in the 1980s.

"If you want to see something that will actually effect the economy of this state in the most positive way imaginable, it's to make sure we have a transportation system that is adequate, that is well maintained and that allows people and commodities and goods to get from point A to point B. . . Do you wonder ever if it's still okay to spend about 60 percent of all the money we take in for transportation for the transportation needs of 4 percent of the population? Because that's what we're doing with Fastracks."
For her hard slog through third grade, Katrina was allowed to pick the family's first vacation trip. Katrina's surgeries and expenses had made vacations an impossible luxury.

The bellboy and amateur composer from Sebastopol had been in the throes of bipolar disorder when he was charged with threatening the lives of co-workers. His family encouraged him to plead not guilty by reason of insanity, thinking that in a mental hospital he would get the treatment he needed.
øGiven that a sector fund is primarily for short- to intermediate-term investing, you need to take a fairly coldhearted view of the fund. The easiest way is to set a stop-loss limit, selling if the fund falls by 10% from its most recent high. If you're dead wrong, you'll only lose 10%.

Of course, north-south commuting families may have to leave one car on each side of the harbor to take full advantage of it.

"I look at it as a 29-year-old guy who had his struggles and was traded, and started to figure out who he was, especially toward the end of last year,” Showalter said. “Talking to [Rockies manager] Jim Tracy and some people I trust over there about where he was, we're basically trying to pick up on what happened with him the last month and a half of the season over in Colorado, where they put him in the 'pen and did some other things with him, started.

The main attraction, of course, is Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, which as everyone knows, belongs to Jersey (okay, so no one "owns’’ it, but it’s closer to our shore than New York’s). Dedicated in 1886, it remains a powerful, enduring symbol of freedom, and you’ll get a great closeup of it from the park. The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island can be reached on ferries operated by Statue Cruises. Tickets are available in the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal building.

Among its recent graduates is the current mayor of Yangzhou, a city in eastern China with a population of more than 4 million.
For the 55-year-old Kandasamy, the stakes are high: Prosecutors have argued that as the top U.S. representative for the Tamil Tigers, he deserves a lengthy sentence — the maximum is 20 years — for raising money for the separatist group.

Sullinger, 20, said making the Final Four helped finalize his decision, and that he's at peace with it now, just as he was last season when he decided to stay after his freshman season, believing he wasn't mature enough for the NBA.

Can they get out of this hole? Yes. Will they? Not unless they can hit a higher gear than what we've seen so far in this series. It was no secret to anyone that the Kings were one of the hottest teams in hockey over the final month of the season. And LA proved it was no fluke when it quickly dispatched top-seeded Vancouver in the first round. The Blues knew what they were up against coming into this series yet they allowed themselves to be outworked and appeared over-matched on home ice in Games 1 and 2. I mean, seriously, TWO shorthanded goals allowed? Now the Blues must not only match the Kings' intensity, they must exceed it ... in the Kings' castle. We know the Blues are a resilient team - they've played through multiple injuries all year - but now they face their stiffest test. As Hitch likes to say, they need to play a 200-foot game. And they need to stay out of the box.

What might strike you first is that the town looks spanking-new, despite being about 120 years old. There's not a lousy roof to be found, and the paint looks barely dry. Then you might remember that Hurricane Charley nearly obliterated Punta Gorda in August 2004. The Category 4 storm slammed into the town with winds of 145 m.p.h., leaving 11,000 destroyed homes and 300 leveled businesses.

Perhaps fall's most-anticipated novel is "The Marriage Plot" by Jeffrey Eugenides, which also takes place in the past.

If you were expecting the National September 11 Memorial to turn out to be a visionary or uncompromising monument to human tragedy and architectural destruction, you probably haven't been paying sustained attention to the process that created it.

Hi, Carolyn: I am still in shock over a recent incident between a party guest and the host.

Some say the city's current policy isn't good enough. In St. Paul, inspectors were required to visit all apartment buildings every two years. But after working through the entire list of properties with at least three units, the city revised its policy in 2007. Now, the most troubled properties are inspected each year, while the best-maintained buildings are on a five-year schedule, according to Steve Zaccard, the St. Paul fire marshal. Zaccard said the city also began inspecting all one- and two-unit dwellings.

Irony and thinly veiled anger rang out in many tales, such as that of Army counterintelligence agent Josh Simpson, who spent a year in Mosul. There, he'd follow hundreds of tips from paid Iraqi informants about supposed terrorists, he said. They'd raid a suspect's home to find nothing, he said, still -- as his commanders prided themselves in detainee counts -- they'd usually arrest the suspect and pay the informant more money.
In addition to the business park are commercial centers at Walerga and Elverta roads, Watt Avenue and Elverta, and Watt and Antelope, said Keith Weber, president of the Antelope-Highlands Chamber of Commerce. As a child, Weber said, he lived on Larchmont Drive in Antelope, which he characterized as the end of civilization in the 1950s. There were only fields and farms, he said. I've lived here since 1954 when my dad was discharged from the Navy and moved here for a civilian job as an aeronautical engineer.

Wild Hibiscus is simple, really, in that edible wild hibiscus flowers are infused in cane sugar and water. When you drop a Wild Hibiscus "bud" into a champagne glass and fill it with bubbly or sparkling wine - the Australian Yellowglen and Cava complement the flowers quite nicely - watch the fizzy magic begin. Your drink turns a delicate pink as the hibiscus spectacularly opens its petals, and then when you're done sipping, you eat the tasty flower with its velvety raspberries-and-rhubarb flavor.

Demographics have always played a big role in the rise and fall of the labor force. Between 1960 and 2000, the labor force in the United States surged from 59 percent to a peak of 67.3 percent. That was largely due to the fact that more women were entering the labor force while improvements in health and information technology allowed Americans to work more years.

He also said he's disturbed by the multiple allegations of excessive force brought against Humphreys in recent lawsuits, and that the bureau hasn't acted to deal with him until now. "Hopefully, this is the straw that will break the camel's back," he said.
A You're right in saying that I'm a fan of investing in equity index mutual funds, bond index funds and comparable products such as broad-based exchange traded funds or ETFs. A majority of actively managed mutual funds typically underperform the so-called passive index strategy. A major reason is that you aren't paying a steep fee for a high-priced professional manager and a team of analysts. Instead, you'll do as well -- or as poorly -- as the underlying index minus a low annual charge. Nobel laureate William Sharpe rightly called indexing "a dull, boring way to be a better investor than many of your friends."
2) Another "must see" would be the escorted or self-guided walking tour of important trees and gardens on the College of William and Mary campus. This is the first time in 79 years that the campus tour has been offered, and it will include The President's Home and The Wren Building and Chapel. Important Civil War history will be discussed.

Though religions are "claimed" to be the source of teachings for honor killings, this practice is going on for thousands of years. It stems from the belief in patriarchal society that woman is a property and her sexuality should be controlled. In Latin America it is called "crime of Passion" and treated with minimum sentence; in India brides are burnt for lack of dowry. Usually many male and at times female members of the family are part of this atrocious act. Cultural norms play a major role in these acts to go unpunished. Unfortunately laws in many countries in Middle East and South Asia are very lenient for this crime and even with persistent efforts of human rights groups the governments at times have not been able to change it due to cultural/political pressures. Though historically this terrible act is practiced in different parts of the world, now days it is seen more in Muslim countries. There are many factors contributing to this; strong male controlled societies, governments not taking steps to match the punishment to the crime and in some cases lack of education play a role. Islam has given equal rights to men and women; each adult person is responsible for his/her acts and family does not have the right to take the life of a woman based on their perception of right/wrong and "honor". Sadly some religious leaders in Muslim countries also condone these acts and try to justify according to our faith.
Trucks, sport utilities and crossovers tend to do much better, a trend seen in numbers from GM, Ford and Chrysler. GM's pickup sales were up 25 percent while its car sales were up only 1 percent. Chrysler's car numbers were better, mostly because of the launches of redesigned sedans.

And then you realize the Brasa Catch-22. At $30, the salad bar alone is wonderful but a bit expensive. If you are plunking down the extra $10 for meat, it's easy to fill up on salad-bar offerings before the roasted slabs start arriving. (Another hurdle to mass consumption, if that's your goal, are the side dishes that come with the meat. Mild salsa is a welcome accompaniment, but cheese-filled bread rolls, french fries, rice and batter-fried bananas all are starchy and filling.)

• With Cory Calvert out of the lineup, we were curious to see who would step up for Chaparral. No surprise in Josh Adams (35 points), Brandon Malone (20) and Wil Keyser (13) leading the way for the Wolverines in a 74-60 win over Thomas Jefferson. Great news for Chaparral fans, though, was the way senior Reece Elliott stepped up for 22 points (3-5 from 3-point). We may be calling this crew the Big 5 when Calvert returns. Chaparral put the game away with a 30-19 fourth quarter. Senior Antonio Clark (19) and sophomore Treyvon Andres (16) led the way for the Spartans with a combined seven 3-pointers. Check out some action photos from this game. Chaparral is getting ready to travel to Vegas for a Holiday tournament and it's a shame Calvert won't be able to participate, but what an opportunity for the rest of the Chap crew to step up.

The performance of all the supposed main players in the Classic was downright disgraceful. Uncle Mo, one of the most talked about horses in the land, bet down to 5-1, chased Game On Dude all the way till they reached the stretch when the real galloping began.

When Marquette (18-13, 9-9) tried to make a game of it in the second half after the Pirates opened an 18-point lead, Willard’s team always found an answer, even when the lead was down to 63-55 with 7:13 to play. It helped that Hazell made one of those acrobatic, desperation 3-pointers that he seems to have a patent on with 5:32 remaining. That was Marquette’s last gasp.

Useless because the level of offensive nuclear weaponry, the subject of the U.S.-Russia "Joint Understanding," is an irrelevance. We could today terminate all such negotiations, invite the Russians to build as many warheads as they want, and profitably watch them spend themselves into penury, as did their Soviet predecessors, stockpiling weapons that do nothing more than, as Churchill put it, make the rubble bounce.
The structural problem is the state's massive underfunding of pension benefits. There's a $17.6-billion difference between what the state has set aside to pay for school employees' retirement benefits and what the state expects to pay for them. This unfunded liability is a 6,500% increase from the $246-million gap in 2000. Numerous attempts have been made to scale the benefits back over the years, and the latest call for increased employee contributions continues the trend.

To David Halberstam (the ever-reliable Stephen Kunken), a rising New York Times reporter, Alsop is just a "preening D.C. socialite with a press pass."

I'm going with the in crowd here, and voting for Belle & Sebastian, but only provisionally. My initial impressions of Write About Love weren't wrong: it's definitely going to go down as a minor entry in a major discography. But after God Help The Girl, Stuart Murdoch probably felt the need to reassure his band that Belle & Sebastian was a real band, and not just a vehicle for his May-December sex fantasies. So I think he eased up on the accelerator just a bit, and let some of his mates shine -- and they do, especially the rhythm section. Sarah Martin gets to kick the album off and sing the big production piece toward the end. Mick Cooke plays more trumpet than he has since Tigermilk. Everybody gets into the game -- it's like one of those late Creedence records where, to avoid a mutiny, John Fogerty turned the band into something like a democracy. Mr. Murdoch, remember Tris McCall axiom #1: nothing good ever came of a vote.

He does not seem to recognize that while he recruits the elite, he fails to comment on the high attrition of Hispanic high school students or the fact that the majority have few advocates working to connect them with the area job market. Nor does he share his position and that of the chamber on current immigration policies that are causing great damage and fear among thousands of undocumented Mexican families. The chamber, according to the chairman, is policy oriented - and very singular - if it helps business, it is good for the entire community.

So I set off to find it, walking through deserted weekday afternoon streets until I ran into the river. The old bridge that crosses it leads to the Dutch town square and St. Paul's Hill, surrounded by a massive fort built in the Portuguese era. But I obstinately turned away from these landmarks and kept following the river west. I must have walked for almost an hour before realizing that the wide flatland I was crossing was reclaimed from the sea, meaning that historic Malacca is no longer on the Strait of Malacca.
