I've watched Knight rumble out of the team locker room after Ducks victories for the past seven years. Once, a couple of seasons ago after an overtime victory over Cal, he was carrying the game ball.

Hales: Yes. I'm supportive of the idea. I want to see specifics of the proposal and the measure, and the funding mechanism, and make sure we address these issues of equity. Are we supporting school grants for just the kids on the Portland city limits side of the line? Just the Multnomah County side of the line? The specifics matter. But as I've said before, I'm supportive of moving forward with some version of this, and I'll be an advocate for it.

It doesn't seem so long ago that every place in Mexico was cheap; all you had to do was look at a few and pick one you liked.

"He is not a happy man, but we got some good news," Showalter said of Johnson, who spent his third night in the hospital. "It looks like that's heading in a good direction. We feel a lot differently about it today than we did yesterday. They said if he can hold the food down that he's going to be eating here shortly, they might be able to release him in the morning.

Sibelius only wrote one concerto, the Violin Concerto in D minor, composed in 1904. It calls for amazing virtuosity from its soloist, particularly in the first and final movements.

His technique is flawless.

The council has a curious sense of priorities. With a persistent structural budget deficit and a looming shortfall in July of at least $150 million, and with basic services such as graffiti abatement and one-call access to City Hall through the 311 telephone system slashed, the city needs the cash that absconders and rip-off artists refuse to pay. But even more basic than the money is the all-too-accurate perception that Los Angeles is an easy mark. The failure to collect money owed merely encourages other deadbeats to rob the city and then, in an act of supposed generosity, agree to some kind of deal in which outstanding debt is written down or written off.

If his touch-sensors determine that he has walked into a wall, he is programmed to shake it off with a quick "I meant to do that." He is also programmed to flinch whenever Ms. Knight pats him on the head. "Don't touch me!" he always barks at her in response.

Ross segued easily to disco anthems "Love Hangover," "It's My House" and "Upside Down." It's intriguing that Gaynor's "I Will Survive" earns an endorsement from Ross. Perhaps she isn't territorial about chart battles of the late '70s and she simply likes the song.

Hey, Rick: I respect your opinion on Mangini. One of his downfalls was loading his roster with older players who were familiar with his "system." Many coaches with experience on other teams frequently do that when they start with a new team. This tends to make the team older. That's OK, as long as you win.

Since topping the rap charts with his double-platinum breakthrough "Best I Ever Had" in 2009, this Canadian rapper has sent two platinum albums -- "Thank Me Later" and "Take Care" -- to No. 1 on Billboard's album chart.

In order for historic agreements to be reached, many currents of history have to converge. First, the right people must emerge.

In the governor's dreams, green jobs will replace all of the "tangible jobs" that the state's losing in agriculture, manufacturing, warehousing and construction. But "green energy doesn't create enough energy!" Mr. Kotkin exclaims. "And it drives up the price of energy, which then drives out other things."

"Smash" (10 p.m. Monday, March 5, WKYC Channel 3): There was a slight increase in viewership for last week's episode with guest star Nick Jonas, but, overall, the ratings have crashed since "Smash" posted big numbers with its premiere on Feb. 6.

It's a time capsule of the 1940s -- period magazines are strewn here and there, piles of paperwork await Bromfield on his desk and a wall of photos documents the celebrities who've passed through.

What makes it different is that director Jesse Peretz, working from a script by his sister Evgenia Peretz and David Schisgall, doesn't have his finger on that movie joke-line button. The one that inserts the punch line followed by a reaction shot to cue the laughs.

Head south to old downtown Melbourne/Eau Gallie to see various galleries and the Brevard Art Museum. You can visit when you go to the beach or on any first Friday night of the month ... like tonight, 5:30-8:30.

"My Little Pony": In the Calendar section elsewhere in this edition, an article about young men who enjoy "My Little Pony" and call themselves bronies (combining "bro" and "ponies") said that members of SoCal Brony, one such fan organization, are planning the first brony convention for the Anaheim Convention Center in November. The event would be the first such convention in Southern California. The article also described the character of Shining Armor as the show's first male pony. He was not the first. The error was detected after the section went to press.

A: There aren't. Because what I've done is made recordings for this show. I mean, I do both. I use backing tracks, and I do things totally alone. It varies. I use special effects as well. It really is a mixture of elements. I thought of having a band, but then, of course, I wouldn't be able to play the intimate places, and it would've all been a lot more expensive. I wanted to do this one in an intimate way, because I think the concept is intimate. They know about my life and the ELP years and all of this. What they really enjoy, I think, is hearing other people in the audience talk about their experiences with the music.

Travelogues abound, of course, and one column can't possibly cover them all. Of the many guidebooks I've read over the years, my favorite remains Kate Simon's Mexico Places and Pleasures. The last edition was published in 1988, but you can still find it in used-book stores and websites. Simon's intricately woven narrative manages to cover hotels, restaurants and social niceties alongside insights on poverty, safety and history. No strictly formatted modern guide can possibly be as comprehensive and accessible.

The higher wage turned Ford's auto workers into customers who could afford to buy Model Ts. In two years Ford's profits more than doubled.

This is your opportunity to ask questions or make suggestions. Don’t wait until the budget is passed and after seeing the impact on your tax bill start yelling. While some expenses are mandated, others are flexible. Those are the ones that you can ask to justify and/or cut. But, after the public hearings and the vote passes the budget, it is too late to complain.
If you feel strongly enough to take time to write a defense, then reach down and find a little courage in there somewhere - and just say it. Make it respectful and well thought out. Give your neighbors something to think about. Civil disagreement is part of the democratic tradition. Hiding behind anonymity while throwing stink bombs is not.

Ken Love: When you talk about exotic fruit in Hawaii, this is the guy. Though his tours are offered just a couple of times a week, by appointment only, this is an excellent chance to visit one of Hawaii's great orchards with the enthusiastic Love, president of the Hawaii Tropical Fruit Growers group and vice president of the Kona Kohala Chefs Assn. One favorite tour is of 82-year-old Margaret Schattauer's home garden, where you can see the famed Archibald Menzies orange tree, planted in 1792 by the naturalist. There you'll also see everything from durian to jackfruit that grow to nearly human size.

Feral cats are born on the streets. They struggle to survive and end up too wild to be handled. They often form colonies or communities, feed on rodents and garbage, and breed without restraint.

We could attempt to figure out who is more right or more wrong in the latest dispute over whether the government should offset added disaster relief funding with cuts elsewhere, but the actual amount of money at stake was so trivial as to render the exercise pointless. All this debate proved was that at a time when the nation is careening toward an even deeper economic crisis, Congress is intent on adding to the panic. No wonder companies aren't hiring and consumers aren't spending when even the most minuscule disagreement in Washington leads to the threat of a government shutdown. Under these conditions, how are we supposed to have any confidence that we won't be right back in the same situation on Nov. 18, or that the deficit-cutting "super committee" is going to come up with a viable plan to avoid draconian cuts in January?

The 50 pounds of muscle the actor put on for the part does a world of good, not merely on the eye-candy front. It gives the actor some substance, offsets his pretty just enough, and grounds his performance in a way that makes Logan feel like the solid, stand-up guy he's meant to be.

One series of studies from Canadian researchers concluded that heavily cushioned shoes were more likely to cause injury than simpler shoes. They also concluded that more expensive athletic shoes accounted for twice as many injuries as cheaper shoes. The data aren't conclusive. It may be that buyers of expensive shoes are more injury prone or more active, and therefore more likely to sustain injuries. A summary of the data on barefoot training can be found at www.sportsci.org/jour/0103/mw.htm.

I went to the softball concessions but unfortunately didn't know the correct code and set the alarm system off. I had to call (athletic director) Mr. (Butch) Zike to turn off the alarm.

We close with another of his journeys from story to story. This one starts with the hope that the folk song era is ending, meaning fewer young "long-faced girls with long, straight tresses who strum guitars and sing melancholy songs." This leads him, naturally enough, to the story of an 81-year-old English woman who rode in an aerobatic plane, and of course that segues into the tale of a Los Angeles lawyer who celebrated his 90th birthday by having himself laid out in a casket before 200 guests, before rising with a yell.

The effort will test whether a state infamous for emphasizing politics over policy and for finding budget shortcuts rather than long-term solutions can change its ways.

Kevin Cowherd, columnist: It’s not the end of the world, even though talk radio is treating it that way this morning. It’s hard to replace a Terrell Suggs, but I fully expect the Ravens to trade for an experienced pass rusher in the coming months. The Courtney Upshaw draft pick looks like a total winner now. And if Sergio Kindle can finally be the player the Ravens hoped he’d be two years ago, the team can weather this storm.

The disc achieves that best by splitting the difference between the manic pace, and ruthless intensity, of their first four CDs and the slower, murkier murmur of their last one, 2009's "Octahedron."

One yearns for more of the delicious thrill of danger faced and thwarted.

As John Hinderaker wrote at the Powerline blog, "In that last observation, Kennedy seems to be channeling Mark Steyn." Which is true. As I wrote in National Review only two or three issues back, "I've argued for years in these pages that governmentalized health care fundamentally transforms the relationship between citizen and state in ways that" – and here's the bit Justice Kennedy isn't quite on board with yet – "make it all but impossible to have genuinely conservative government ever again."
