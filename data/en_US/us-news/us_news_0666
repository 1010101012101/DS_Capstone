A. Florida gardeners can grow great tomatoes during the winter if it stays warm. Cooler temperatures slow growth and keep the flowers from setting fruits. Select the warmest, sunniest spot in your landscape for a winter crop. A porch with limited light is only of value as a place to keep the plants warm during cold days and nights. Even so, some coverings and a heat source may be needed. A few tomato varieties are marketed as cold tolerant. These can probably better tolerate a little chilly weather and keep producing. During the cooler weather, reduce feedings to every three to four weeks and water when the soil starts to dry to the touch.

My mother runs this clinic, striving to provide the best and most cost-effective medicine possible. She must avoid extraneous expenses so that her patients are able to access quality care despite the depressed economy. Without the resources to purchase all the necessary but expensive journal subscriptions, many of which cost hundreds to thousands of dollars per year, she is unable to access the most recent medical discoveries that would benefit her patients. At times, she has had to call upon me — a medical student at Johns Hopkins not yet in clinical practice — to seek out current studies and provide synopses of the most recent science. She should not have to resort to such convoluted means to obtain information that is so vital for her patients' well-being.

The trial's findings, conducted at the University of Basel in Switzerland and published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, might seem counterintuitive. But they are built on two lines of research. The first suggests that fearful memories have become inextricably tangled up with the object of one's phobia, and each time we face that stimulus, those memories get dredged up. The second suggests that cortisol, a steroid hormone that is produced by the adrenal cortex but can be produced synthetically, affects memory in two ways: It makes old and especially emotionally-laden memories harder to retrieve (quick! disregard that oncoming train and tell me your mother's birthday), and makes new memories more likely to stick (which is why we often remember extremely stressful moments in our lives with exquisite clarity).

In a wide world of differences, Romney has always snuggled safely in his own, sheltered by power and privilege. Were all limited by our experiences, but Romneys failure to get out of his own skin, and reach beyond his background, has undercut his ability to understand and appreciate other people. Thats not a good thing for a man seeking to be president.

Notes: Jenkins suffered a concussion in the game and Halahuni sprained an ankle. No word on the severity of the injuries. ... Wulff said OSU "used more tight ends and two-back (sets) than it has shown all year.'' ... OSU was flagged for 120 yards on 14 penalties. ... and still coasted. ... it was the first neutral-site game between the two Northwest rivals since 1941. … freshman defensive end Dylan Wynn set a school record with his fourth and fifth fumble recoveries of the season. … Crichton tied a record with his fourth forced fumble. … for the game, Crichton had 7 tackles and a sack. ... outside linebacker Michael Doctor also had 7 tackles. ... Agnew had a huge impact on OSU’s ability to move the ball with 104 yards on 23 carries. … the Beavers had several second-and-short situations, as opposed to second-and-long. It opened up the playbook and allowed offensive coordinator Danny Langsdorf to utilize his playmakers more. … Tuel took a beating. OSU sacked him three times in the first half, including a crushing hit by defensive end Taylor Henry, who had two sacks. … Wulff said, "right now he's just very sore and we still need to do some scans to see where he's at but we don't envision it being serious.'' ... however, it was the same left shoulder that Tuel injured in Wazzu's season opener. ... Agnew came out in the fourth quarter and gave way to Terron Ward, not because he re-aggravated his hamstring, because Riley felt he had enough carries.

Many members of the Los Angeles City Council think poorly ofWal-Mart, and with some good reason. They fear the giant retailer's reputation for crowding small businesses out of neighborhoods, and they are sensitive to the charge that the company's commitment to holding down prices comes at the expense of salary and benefits for its nonunion workforce. Egged on by their supporters in organized labor, members of the council will take up a proposal Friday to impose a temporary moratorium on retail development in Chinatown. That measure in theory would block any large chain store from locating there; in practice, it is aimed at just one: Wal-Mart, which has proposed a 33,000-square-foot grocery. The council's move may be understandable, but the proposal is unwise and counterproductive.

The show might have worked better with expert actors at the top of their game.

It's worth exploring whether the federal government has enabled colleges to raise tuitions by making loans and grants available to more students, as well as the broader question of how to make college more affordable.

He suggested that the local soccer league was too powerful and commiserated that the city's yard waste pickup "sucks."

"I don't shy away from anything," he boasted to the group.

But the prize monster of these parts is called an abalone. The abalone, if pulled out of the North Sea, would be a coquille, and if pulled out of Long Island Sound would be a scallop; but as it is, it is pulled out of the Pacific, which makes it different. The shell is large, some six or eight inches across, and fluted like a scallop shell, very pretty. The thing itself is a lump of muscle about the size of a small lemon, and so tough that if you tried to cut it, it would jump off the plate and hit the lady at the next table in the eye. So they operate on it with a hammer to soften it up a bit. How many outfielders they have to post, to field it home when it jumps off the block, I don't know; but when they get through with it, it is a sort of Childs pancake, and this they dip in batter and fry. You can have it. I got half of one down once: what an experience that was!
From the obscure to the world famous: The next stop is the famous switchback section of Lombard Street. Unlike most of Courtney's tour stops, this one is swarming with camera-wielding tourists.

Workers using robots have had to grind and re-weld tiny cracks in 24 of the 69 "nozzles" in Davis-Besse's lid.

In older lids, the nozzles crack -- and leak -- over time.
The exotic newcomers have spread across 10 Oregon counties and into Southwest Washington. At several sites, overwhelming numbers appear to be displacing native ground beetles. The gazelle beetles adapt to a variety of landscapes: from heavily disturbed industrial sites in Portland and Willamette Valley farm fields to wild mountain meadows and old-growth forests in the Coast Range. The half-inch beetle, known by scientists as Nebria brevicollis, earned its common name because of its speed.

The better NFL teams that already are moving in the right direction draft to add to what they have. Much of the San Diego Chargers' draft last week was to fix errors, such as giving big contracts to mediocre players (such as linebacker Jyles Tucker, signed in 2008 for five years and $14 million, released before the '11 season) and previous poor draft choices (such as linebacker Larry English, first round in 2009, seven sacks in three seasons). If this year's first-round pick, Melvin Ingram, a linebacker out of South Carolina, is as good as he appears to be, then a major deficiency is solved and future drafts can again be the foundation of long-term planning.
Wendell Maxey: Much like the case with Luke Babbitt, Elliot Williams also receives an incomplete for his rookie season. At least for guys like Babbitt and Armon Johnson the evaluation process played out in slow pace and included D-League stints. Sadly enough, Williams' claim to fame in Portland this season was being part of the Greg Oden, Brandon Roy and Marcus Camby knee surgery club. Hopefully Williams keeps battling back and gets the chance to let his game speak for him next season.
"The heart of the draft is to get teams improved as quickly as possible and to allow for competitive balance. It doesn't put you in as big a hole if the player you choose does not work out; remember that 50 percent of those chosen in the first round do not wind up being good starters in the league for a long period of time.
"In the ‘Me generation,' the lines between entertainment and self-expression become blurred," he said.
The second major flaw is that, for a film designed to show how we are all "one" and "interconnected," the subjects interviewed are either great thinkers or fringe players in society.

As cadets, you volunteered for service during this time of danger. Some of you have fought in Afghanistan. Many will deploy there. As your Commander-in-Chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of your service. That is why, after the Afghan voting was completed, I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy. Let me be clear: there has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010, so there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war. Instead, the review has allowed me ask the hard questions, and to explore all of the different options along with my national security team, our military and civilian leadership in Afghanistan, and with our key partners. Given the stakes involved, I owed the American people - and our troops - no less.

But the savings could be elusive, he said, if the system of dual governance that would be created, involving a nonprofit board and a publicly elected management agency, proved burdensome.

These Brit-pop sensations from Manchester, England, may be best remembered in the States for a pair of alternative radio hits, 1992's "Born of Frustration" and the following year's controversial "Laid," whose provocative sex talk required a radio edit that robbed the song of all its charm.

Among other promised steps, they pledged to pass legislation by June that will cut public spending by an additional 5.5% of gross domestic product. Economists say the cuts will further depress the Greek economy, which has contracted 14% in the past four years and is expected to shrink by a further 5% or more this year.
øA: We have to be grounded in the reality that it will take all forms of energy for us to meet our needs. We have an energy system that's been built up over the last 100 years, and the principle behind it has been affordable energy. And we've seen oil, gas, coal, nuclear and renewables contribute to that energy mix. The idea that we can force energy into the system that's not economic before its time is not the policy that I think this country needs. What we need is open markets, consistent tax and regulatory policy, and to be clear about our priorities. We've seen an emphasis on environmental issues. Those are important. We also have national security objectives. But overriding all of these is the need to have affordable energy. And right now, we're seeing the emphasis in other areas, and we're getting a predictable outcome, which is higher prices, whether it's utility costs or gas at the pump.

Chapters alternate between 1962, with the fair's halcyon futurism projecting global harmony amid the darkest days of the Cold War, and 2001 on the eve of 9/11. Lynch ties these eras together with a plotline involving a political exposé. Roger Morgan, fictional organizer of the fair at age 30 -- and known to the populace ever after as "Mr. Seattle" -- becomes a septuagenarian mayoral candidate in 2001.

Even though it's easy for parents to blame their children's bad behavior on peers and assume that other kids coerce them into doing things like drinking, smoking, stealing or cheating, poor decision-making among teens isn't all about pressure. Kids actively want to emulate their peers. During adolescence, they are looking for ways to separate from their families and begin to define themselves as individuals. To that end, they turn to friends for guidance and direction. They tend to mimic their peers' behaviors and adopt the same attitudes. Conforming to social norms helps them redefine themselves while earning them acceptance and approval. Fitting in simply feels good.

Federal elections law allows 501(c)4 groups to collect unlimited, undisclosed donations as long as a majority is spent on their primary mission and not on electioneering. Issue campaigns are considered voter education while candidate campaigns are categorized as electioneering. As a result, groups that want to spend heavily on candidates in the 2012 elections have an incentive to jack up their spending on issue campaigns, such as Senate Bill 5, to keep their electioneering spending below 50 percent of their overall expenditures, according to Fazekas of We AreOhio.

* Given some of the speculative numbers being thrown around on the pending new contract extension for Yadier Molina, he'd become one of the highest-paid catchers in MLB history. Understand that there's no way this deal happens if Albert Pujols is still here, making more than $20 million guaranteed annually over the next 10 seasons. And I doubt - or at least question - whether the team could afford a new deal for starting pitcher Adam Wainwright with Pujols occupying so much payroll space. One positive to the Angels' power move for Pujols is that it gave Cardinals' management the kind of payroll flexibility the franchise hasn't had for years.

The kindergartners helped pulled down numbers in the elementary schools. As of Sept. 12, there were 879 kindergartners, a drop from 902 last year. The school district has 71 fewer elementary students this year. Stark Haydon said the drop of kindergartners at the district can be attributed, in part, to tuition costs for their full-day program. In 2008-2009, free full-day kindergarten was available at Metzger, Bridgeport and Tualatin elementary schools. Since then, state budget cuts have forced the district to charge $3,600 in tuition per child, per year.

The food is an eclectic mish-mosh of engaging flavors, and the sweeping range of prices invites sampling without taking too heavy a toll on the wallet. Roasted dates stuffed with manchego and chorizo, all wrapped in bacon, is the best kind of bar food, intriguing and seductive. Crispy confit chicken wings with a schmear of yogurt blue cheese with smoky chili sauce were tasty but overpriced. Definitely go for the terrific plump calamari strips mixed with small shrimp in a tantalizing miso glaze topped with radish salad. Unusual small salads, well-executed and fresh, exceed the usual and predictable combos. Seared all-natural chicken hits all the marks -- crispy, juicy and flavorful -- and a modest portion of grouper was similarly excellent. Both sported savory sides that are imaginative yet somehow familiar.

As before, in a testimonial to both Democratic and Republican state budget directors reaching back decades -- most recently, Democrat Pari Sabety, and now Kasich appointee Tim Keen -- Moody's observed that Ohio has "a record of strong financial management."

Willie wasn't the only ASU wideout to have a big day. Gerrel Robinson had seven catches for 101 yards. Their production was a direct off-shoot of Utah taking away the swing pass to Jamal Miles, who had just three receptions for 19 yards. With so much attention paid to Miles, Willie and Robinson only had one defender to beat much of the afternoon.

"I don't think most homeowners really realize how bad the chemicals in the coatings industry really are to the environment," said Bryan Tibbetts, whose Indianapolis company, Fresh Colors Painting LLC, offers low- and zero-VOC paints. These paints have grown in popularity as more paint manufacturers transition from traditional petroleum-based paints.
When the sugar is the correct shade, remove the pan from the heat. Wearing a oven mitt, slowly pour the hot cream into the sugar syrup a little at a time. The mixture will sputter and foam.

To move forward, we, as a country, need to lower the political conflict. Yes, the views found in fundamentalist churches are not exactly the same as those at the National Science Foundation. But we would see less of the polarizing "we real Americans" rhetoric from the religious right if its members were not ridiculed as know-nothings. Conservative Protestants are not fundamentally opposed to all science.
When police arrived on the scene, they found Mr. Martin had been carrying only a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea. Yet they did not arrest Mr. Zimmerman, because they accepted his claim that he had acted in self-defense.

Two years ago, architect Robert A.M. Stern, the dean of the architecture school at Yale, was asked in a video interview for a website called Big Think why there aren't more women in architecture. After seeming to sense that he was moving along the edge of a rhetorical precipice ("Oh, my God," he stammered, "I'm gonna, this is complicated"), he composed himself -- and proceeded to leap right into the chasm anyway.

According to a survey last year, the number of cellphone subscribers worldwide has hit 5 billion, or nearly three-quarters of the global population.
So Michigan coach Brady Hoke has upset some Buckeyes by referring to OSU as "Ohio." This isn't quite Steve Spurrier calling Florida State "Free Shoes University."

His benching caught most observers by surprise, considering he was taking practice reps with the first unit all the way through fall camp. Ultimately, in the week leading up to the Civil War, Katz was not taking reps with the second unit, either – those were handled by sophomore Cody Vaz.
The company says a citrus-based solvent will leave the oil-soaked sands as clean as beach sand. According to Todd, Utah's oil sands are sweeter or lighter with less polluting sulfur than in Albert's vastly larger deposits — he called them "environmentally responsible hydrocarbons." Utah has an estimated 12 to 19 billion barrels of oil buried in its tar sands, though not all of that is considered is accessible.

JOE ARPAIO and ANDREW THOMAS, a showboat tag team as sheriff and county attorney, were responsible for ratcheting up the heat and dimming any light on this issue. Arpaio's immigration sweeps stirred anti-immigrant sentiment and made "driving while Latino" a suspicious activity. Thomas' decision to use a law aimed at criminal smugglers to prosecute illegal immigrants was a perversion of that law-enforcement tool.

After Friday night's game with the Canton Charge, Harangody was told to pack his bags and join the Cavaliers for one night. And, oh yes, make sure he boarded the first plane to Springfield, Mass., on Sunday for a D-League playoff game against the Armour.

Solution: Santana has to improve against right-handers. Last year, he hit .318 (57-for-179) against lefties and .201 (75-for-373) against righties. He's capable of making the adjustment because in 2010 he hit .314 (32-for-102) against righties and .146 (7-for-48) against lefties.

But the law changed four times since the 1990s. Each time the time frame was expanded. This year the law was changed so a victim has 30 years from the time he or she turns 18 to report the crime.
Across America, millions of mothers can't rise because they don't have adequate support systems as they try to improve their skills.

Here's another sardonic look at the hell of the American high school, where countless American filmmakers believe our souls are locked no matter how long it’s been since we graduated.

"The idea is to allow this to reflect in some ways the private sector more," said Sen. Andy Biggs, R-Gilbert. "This gives people who run state agencies and departments more control over their employees, as you would see if you were in the private sector."
The insistent riffing and ear-catching hook of “Help Me” (“You’ve got to help me help myself”) even suggested that some sort of mainstream crossover might be possible. Young women who might be reluctant to pick up an electric guitar could certainly use this kind of role model: a 4-foot pixie who can outshred any guy on the planet.

Presumptive GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney began the week by saying he, too, wanted current interest rates extended temporarily, heaping further pressure on congressional Republicans to act.
In a genre brimming with more-is-more-ists, Chiang is notable for his sparse publication history. The first story in this book appeared in 1990 (remember Omni?), the last in 2002, with only three additional fictions appearing since then. In fact, he has more awards (including multiple Hugos and Nebulas) than published works, suggesting he's that rare writer who waits until a story reaches its ideal state before releasing it into the world. (Chiang's even rarer than that: He actually turned down a Hugo nomination for the final story in this volume, the polyphonic "Liking What You See: A Documentary," because he wasn't satisfied with how it came out.)
"This was just really exciting for us to do at The Q, because to my knowledge it's never really been done by a celebrity chef in a place like that -- and we really like to be on the edge of things," says Symon.
