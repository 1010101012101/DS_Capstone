Connally maintains that no decision was made out of the public's sight. She says she simply wanted to gauge her colleagues' thinking.

Of all the impressive things he did on Monday, I really admired the smooth slide up in the pocket past a rushing DT Chris Canty and the ball to WR Marques Colston for the 50-yard play to change the drive that changed this game.

What this plan will do is to make the insurance you have work better for you. Under this plan, it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. As soon as I sign this bill, it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it most. They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or a lifetime. We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they get sick. And insurance companies will be required to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies - because there's no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse. That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives.

Winston Churchill's famous observation that "this pudding has no theme" applies well to the substance of Mr. Romney's campaign so far. Its prime ingredient up to now has been that the present cook in the kitchen, Barack Obama, has failed to serve up a digestible menu.

It must seem like that every week in Harlan County. Quarles is surely turning out to be a devil in a three-piece suit, and his reputation has caught up with him. Givens quotes his rap sheet to him in the first scene and mentions his "propensity for toolin' up male hustlers. Is that why you're here?" the lawman asks the crook. "In exile?"

He waited until he was 78 to record his first album, but it took Ed Reed only another year to release his sophomore effort, "The Song Is You" (Blue Shorts Records) with the Peck Allmond Sextet. Emerging clean and inspired from decades of struggle with drugs and alcohol, the Richmond resident (and counselor) brings deep comprehension, compassion, self-knowledge and self-forgiveness to his resonant treatments of classics by Ellington, Rodgers and Hart, Hoagy Carmichael, Leonard Bernstein (with Comden and Green) and others. Billy Eckstein, Nat "King" Cole" and Bill Henderson may come to mind, but it's Reed who lives the "Lucky to Be Me" message of these songs.

GEORGE CLOONEY
Changing the direction of the conversation somewhat, I'd like to spend a minute on the more likely "what-if" scenario wherein the central banks and private investors do not radically diversify out of dollar assets. In my view, this will result in a long-term secular depreciation of the dollar; after all, in the coming years, we will paying more in interest and dividends to the rest of the world than we will be receiving, and in order to keep the current account at current levels, the U.S. will need to export (on net) more. In other words, the "exorbitant privilege" that Gourinchas and Rey highlight (we get higher returns on our assets abroad than foreigners get on American assets) won't be sufficient to offset the massive debt we have taken on in the past decade. This will be true, despite the fact that our foreign-currency denominated assets abroad will rise in value when the dollar depreciates, limiting the deterioration in our net debt position (see Klitgaard and Tille). That's not a calamitous outcome -- merely a slow descent into genteel indebtedness, what Martin Wolf called the "comfortable path to ruin."

And the final word goes to Kevin Burns, in Branford, Conn., who says my logic is flawed because college bills typically arrive two decades before retirement, and that those 20 years are "usually the time in which earnings and savings rates climb significantly."

For the most part there's plenty of time and income and savings opportunity to catch up."

But such disapproval lacks context. Without Camden Yards, there was a good chance that the Orioles might have left Baltimore entirely — if not to a location in the suburbs perhaps out of state. Edward Bennett Williams made no secret of his desire to make the team more accessible to fans from Washington. There was no direct threat to leave, but then the organization never had to make one — Baltimoreans were all too aware of that possibility of losing a sports franchise since the beloved Colts left town in 1984.

Once you've stopped prednisone, the signs of Cushing's disease eventually will go away. You might have to diet to get rid of the fat that's been deposited and to hurry the process along. The pituitary gland is a small gland at the base of the brain. It makes hormones that stimulate other endocrine glands, like the adrenal gland. Your pituitary gland has stopped its production of the adrenal stimulating hormone and your body's cortisone production. The gradual reduction of the dose of prednisone will get the production of the stimulating hormone back onto the assembly line. You'll be tested to see if your gland has become fully functional.

He's put his time to good use. Everything on his menus  lunch, brunch or dinner  is reliably delicious. Some, however, are even better than that, like the beef Wellington we had on the special Valentine's menu. Regulars should beg or cajole the chef to serve it more often. It was so tender, so perfectly cooked and so flavorful, this thick steak covered with duxelles (mushrooms and shallots minced and then sautéed in butter) hiding inside a golden brown pastry.

Even now, if your idea of a first-rate general art museum is one that's stuffed with European painting and sculpture dating from ancient Greece and Rome to the rambunctious launch of the 20th century, the Seattle Art Museum is not for you.

There's great porcelain, but you won't find a Picasso painting.

And if Franco looks exhausted in the movie, it's a testament to his acting, yes, but also a natural consequence of the hours he kept while making it. After working six days, Franco took the red-eye from Salt Lake City to New York on Sunday nights so he could make his Monday morning fiction workshop at Columbia University. Then, because there were no direct flights back to Utah, Franco would return to Los Angeles, arrive after midnight, grab a few hours of sleep in the airport terminal and then catch the 6 o'clock flight back to Salt Lake.

Atkins and Yalkowsky performed "Tower," "Heavy Boots" and four more "Mondo Amore" songs on Tuesday. Stripped to its rudiments — many of the arrangements on the album are big and busy — the material felt even more powerful. "The Tower" had no crashing cymbals or piano cascades, but Atkins was at the top of her game, telling her disaster story with wide-eyed vigor. The languor that has often characterized her vocal approach was still there; it still often took her a few slurred seconds to arrive at the vowel she wants to sing. But with no reverb to hide behind, she demonstrated urgency that isn’t always apparent on her recordings. If "Mondo Amore" didn’t make it clear, the show confirmed it: Two-fisted blues-rock suits her very well.

At this point, I'm not aware of similar specific requirements outside Europe. In general, however, Australia and New Zealand are quite pro-consumer; other areas are iffier. That's why I recommend that you arrange as much as you can through travel companies based in the U.S. or with a significant presence in the U.S. Dealing with a U.S. presence is especially important for local accommodations -- hotels, vacation rentals, and such. In the event you have a problem with a small, independent hotel outside the country, recourse is almost impossible.

Things got better when TE/FB Bear Pascoe came in for FB Henry Hynoski, but I’m not going to throw Hynoski under the bus because he’s been pretty good for a rookie. And while it looked like he was running past defenders Sunday, the times I noticed that were when people in front of him whiffed on their blocks. So he either missed the free guy because he was headed for his assignment or, on one play, he had to clean up the mess after a missed block and never got to his guy.

The music has an endearing innocence. And while the keyboards fill out the sound and Matt Uychich can be a monster on drums, it’s Sella’s confessional lyrics that win audiences’ hearts. Wearing his heart on his sleeve (like the early Jonathan Richman, only in key), Sella sings with disarming honesty of his failures with life and women, but there’s usually a punch line waiting at the end of a verse. “I will remember that summer as the summer when I took steroids,” he sings in “The Beers,” “because you like a man with muscles and I like you.”
Upon reaching the hotel, Sparky immediately called his wife, Carol, to tell her he had cleared the first hurdle. Carol, of course, was supportive of Sparky. She's always been a lady of extraordinarily good common sense.
The big trade with St. Louis last year? It has been painful for Avs fans to see the big numbers put up this year by Kevin Shattenkirk, and Chris Stewart is starting to get his game together after a poor first half for the Blues. Shattenkirk's play probably does tilt the trade in the Blues' favor so far, but Erik Johnson has played better in the last 35 games, and Jay McClement quietly has had a tremendous season with 10 goals and solid PK work. And the Avs still have 2011 11th overall pick Duncan Siemens as part of that deal.

I'd heard her on records all of my life, but hearing her live was something altogether different. Some of us backstage stood motionless.

CaliforniaSpeaks, as it was called, was a noble, high-tech exercise in "deliberative democracy." But it shouldn't take millions of philanthropic dollars to engage Californians in complex issues that directly affect their lives - even though that kind of involvement is clearly necessary. A disturbing poll in May by the Public Policy Institute of California found that California voters admitted "to knowing little or nothing about some of the most critical policy issues they may be facing in next year's election."

Once you know how many people will attend, decide whether you will steam the crabs yourself or purchase them pre-steamed from a local seafood market.

With the 2012 election still far off on the horizon, I follow politics with only a dispassionate level of interest, but I couldn't help notice that Perry evidently wants to position himself as the ultra-Christian candidate.

I've seen a number of objects lifted up and out of open windows of automobiles in motion. Brandished with a purpose. Each day it's been a different symbol. Wednesday it was a baseball bat shaken belligerently to the downdeep beats of DJ Quick as a long yellow Cadillac took St Andrews Place at an estimated eighty mph.

Shriver is an incisive social satirist with a clear grip on the ironies of our contemporary age.

Dixon, who backed down to no one, including his coach, gave Maryland the persona that helped turn an up-and-coming team into a national power. He might not have had the physical prowess of Len Bias, whose scoring record he broke, or the otherworldly schoolyard skills of Steve Francis, who he played behind as a redshirt freshman, but Dixon had the mental toughness that came from having to fend for himself after his drug-addicted parents died from AIDS-related illnesses when he was a teenager in Baltimore.

That's something that deserves a collective and hearty "cheese" from everyone who calls Northeast Ohio home. Cleveland may struggle to keep its ballplayers. But it does a damn fine job of keeping its cheese makers.

And as Portland is finding out, Andre Miller might be gone, but he will not soon be forgotten around these parts.
"There's a been a good bit of pressure," Dufner said. "People talking about, 'Why aren't you winning? Why can't you close the deal? ... Friends, family, media, even people in my inner circle. And not in a negative way, but when you're leading tournaments going into weekends and you're finishing 24th, there's going to be some questions."

Why did it take so long? Did Mama Maloof finally tell these guys to look at their finances and hire an antitrust lawyer to make sure KJ and Stern weren't conspiring to restrict their ability to run their team? A lawyer is always the last refuge for such people.
The backers had one potent weapon: the sort of single-minded dedication to an idea, familiar to anyone with kids. The entire debate has been akin to a half-decade debate with a growing child:

Businesses cannot plan for the future because the rules constantly change and they have no idea what the costs will end be.
I’m headed to France to meet my niece. While I’m gone, my husband, a reluctant gardener, will water the seeds. He is a most diligent waterer. Every morning after breakfast he fills our birdbaths. He also takes the night’s batch of dehumidifier water from the basement and pours it on whatever bush or tree he thinks needs a little extra. He keeps a watchful eye on the 10 rhododendrons planted under the tall Japanese zelkova. Rain often misses them.

Just as we saw in baseball, none of this is about the fans. Yes the owners in the NBA claim – just as baseball claimed 10 years ago – that this is all about competitive balance. Unfortunately, there is simply no evidence that competitive balance is changed dramatically by luxury taxes and salary caps.

To keep Porter, who declined through an athletic spokesman to comment for this story, Akron extended his contract 10 years and raised his base salary $100,000 to $270,000 a year, plus incentives. He also gets $800 per month for a car allowance, up to $7,500 a year for a club membership, a retention bonus of $15,000 a year in an escrow account and $80,000 a year to help promote the university. Akron also rebuilt the soccer stadium.
The angst around the Brendan Ryan trade didn't crack the list, and neither did the annual vigil for Tony La Russa's return. Some things are inevitable. In a flash of instant armchair blogging, Jaime Garcia's spring training probably deserved a sixth or seventh consideration for the list. I was also reminded this morning that the closing of Club Flip shouldn't be overlooked. It was, after all, the CBGB of the lower west side upper corner of the Cardinals' clubhouse. The 20-inning game was historical and remarkable in the moment, but did it galvanize the team as some argued the morning after? Wasn't its role in the season faded by the time Brad Penny's
6. Conserve light and energy along with reusing sheets and towels. "Air conditioning, heating and lighting use a lot more energy than washing towels,” says Bob Schildgen, a.k.a. Mr. Green for Sierra magazine. “And turn off the TV if you're not watching it. The room shouldn't have to be any hotter than 60 or cooler than 78."

Before that, the race at California ran caution-free for 124 laps. Rain brought out the yellow on lap 125, and the race was called four laps later. Texas two weeks ago had just two cautions — both for debris — totaling 10 laps and a 234-lap green-flag run to the finish.
The just-opened Titanic Belfast attraction woos customers with nine exhibition galleries full of details on the ship's construction in Northern Ireland. In New York, the auction house Guernsey's has been taking written offers and hoping to reap tens of millions of dollars from the winner-take-all sale of 5,500 artifacts raised from the wreck.

Yost was with the Braves, working his way to bullpen coach and later third-base coach, as homegrown stars such as David Justice, Tom Glavine and Chipper Jones reached the majors.

In New Jersey, Democrats gained one seat in the state Assembly for a 48-32 edge, and maintained a 24-16 hold on the Senate; in doing so, they beat back strong Republican challenges in Bergen and Atlantic counties.
"So as I moved on to college and all I had to play was running back, I was like, 'Why shouldn't I know what everyone else is doing?' If there was a situation where we got a couple guys hurt, and then it's 'Marshall, we're going to stick you in the slot,' I could just say OK because I knew what I was doing. To me it was no different than if you're in a room full of people and the teacher is giving one person instructions on how to do something, does that mean you shouldn't take notes, too?
David Whitley, FanHouse: "If the Buckeyes start resembling this year's Gators and Meyer resigns for 'health reasons' in three years, then I'll believe Urban was more scam artist than coach. My guess is in three years, he'll be as beloved in Columbus as he was in Gainesville. And all the burnout questions will have quickly faded away."
Several board members nodded when Barer responded to one question that his committee did not go deep into the details of the financial ramifications of the merger. He said figuring costs would be "the next step" of the process.

The one thing Moore and the coaches can't fully prepare Luck to face is the pressure he will encounter. He's The Guy Who Replaced Peyton Manning. He's got massive shoes to fill.
Then, in 2005, another Mission Viejo gated community, Casta del Sol, asked for and received permission from City Council to shoot rabbits. While the effort was controversial, it also reportedly worked.
It took until nearly midway through the third period before Crawford got beat, when Franzen intercepted the puck and angled it in from the boards. Datsyuk ensured the Nashville scenario with 46.4 seconds left in regulation when he tapped in the puck after Tomas Holmstrom sent it sliding through the paint.
The entire record of the Bloomberg/(Police Commissioner Ray) Kelly administration has been one of consistent disregard for civil rights, always in the interests of an ever-growing, police state type of “security.” The “stop-and-frisk” practice alone would qualify that administration for classification as embryonic fascists. Certainly it is a practice we have previously seen exclusively by hard-core, police state regimes.
Presser said there have been discussions to have people who attend future street festivals pay a tiered admittance fee, but he stressed that's only in the preliminary stages.

Kramer, Miller and Newberger run the Garrison, N.Y.-based Ironbound Films, whose releases include several PBS documentaries. (Kramer, a West Orange native, and Miller, who grew up in Edison, named their company after the Newark neighborhood since they have vivid memories of their parents driving them through it on trips to New York.) Compared with the trio's previous work -- studies of endangered languages ("The Linguists") and global poverty ("The New Recruits") -- "Évocateur" is surprisingly blue in terms of its subject matter.
The media coverage of Obama was particularly rough at the beginning of the year, with an average of nearly 47% negative stories compared with slightly more than 15% positive stories during the first four weeks of January, Pew found. As the economy and his poll numbers improved in March, so did the favorability of his media coverage, but the president still has yet to see more positive coverage than negative in 2012.

Grandma Huang, ruling over her son, his short-tempered wife and their four children, emerges as one of the more memorable figures of modern memoir. Her parents, as we learn, were rich landowners. As was the custom, her feet were bound at the age of 6. Her husband and most of his family, also rich landowners, died when a tuberculosis epidemic swept through central China in the 1930s. Their farmland was flooded by the Yellow River, their livestock was taken by the invading Japanese and famine turned them into beggars.
Asked if Obama would veto a plan that did not extend the government's borrowing authority into 2013, Daley said, "Yes."
Mississippi State apparently is following the path to NIT-land carved out by Illinois a few weeks ago. The Bulldogs have lost five in a row and fallen to 62nd in the RPI, 81st in the Pomeroy rankings and 63rd in the Sagarin ratings. Lose even one of their final two—at South Carolina and at home against Arkansas—and they’ll be in big, big trouble.

"Their aggressiveness just totally took us out of our game," Hawks coach Larry Drew said. "We didn’t respond to it all. We didn’t have the zap, we didn’t have the speed. We were doing everything at about 60 percent.
Perhaps WrestleMania 27's legacy (other than a celebration of The Rock returning to WWE) is the era of the multiple “epic entrance.” The Miz, John Cena, The Undertaker and HHH all entered the GeorgiaDome to a spectacular, out-of-the-ordinary entrance, for the most part with different music. This year, it's already been announced that Machine Gun Kelly will sing John Cena to the ring, while Flo Rida will belt out a track as The Rock walks that aisle. The Undertaker and HHH are good for two more larger-than-life openings as well (over-under on whether or not HHH chooses another Metallica song, or is that point moot since the theme to the rivalry itself is “The Memory Remains”)? Oddly enough, perhaps the most epic moment of all four will be when The Undertaker finally removes his hood to reveal ... his usual long hair (yep, you heard me – I “guarantee” it!).

"Assuming that the assertions of the Champion family and their attorney Chris Chestnut are true, then it is entirely possible that Champion's tragic death was less about any ritualistic hazing and more tantamount to a hateful and fully conscious attempt to batter a young man because of his sexual orientation," attorney Chuck Hobbs wrote.
