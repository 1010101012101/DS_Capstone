Etan's parents waited 22 years to declare him dead, most likely in hope that he was still alive. Their loss, like that of so many others with missing family members, may still be ambiguous, despite publicly acknowledging his death. Madeleine's parents may have their own dreams of reunification fanned by investigators, although in some cases the opposite happens.

For example, consumers are often surprised to find that no scientifically sound, comprehensive study has conclusively found that cell phones cause cancer.

77. Jeff Allen, T, Illinois, 6-4, 307. A four-year starter at left tackle -- he started last 46 games of his career, including nine as a true freshman. Played some guard during the Senior Bowl practices and some believe that may be his best position in the NFL. He is a little more advanced in pass protection than many linemen in the class, so could certainly go early in the second round to some of the teams that have had the most interest.

When we propose legislation, we have only foresight and cannot write perfect laws. One way or another, we'll err. The question we must ask as Americans is if we ought to err on the side of the individual or on the side of the government. I prefer to side with the individual over the groupthink of the government. If there is a will to harm or kill others, violent and crazy people will do so regardless of the law. When the government errs, you can end up with Pol Pots, Stalins and Hitlers. On the whole, I'd prefer our limited massacres to institutionalized mass killings, as despicable as they both are.

The route starts near the Chimney Tree in Phillipsville and winds into Humboldt Redwoods State Park, where the best groves are found between the hamlets of Miranda and Pepperwood. My kids love Myers Flat, where they are able to climb around the Two-Story Tree House, then jump back in the car to watch as Dad gingerly guides the station wagon through the Shrine Drive-Thru Tree. This tree has a natural cleave in its base that was widened in pre-environmental movement days so that a small-to-medium-size car can squeeze through. There are two other drive-through trees - both created by cutting: the Chandelier Drive-Thru Tree, to the south near Leggett, and Tour Thru Tree near Klamath to the north.

I always felt that a candidate should be held to his accomplishments and the family should be off limits. That being said, let's say Ann Romney has a beach front home and many high end cars I see no relevance since she and the Romney family paid for it, not the taxpayer so ultimately it is none of our business.

Another thing about that play: I had mentioned in my game preview the Giants’ D-line wanted to limit the windows into which Brady could throw. They did a real nice job of that for much of the day but then parted up the middle for him on the most important play of the game. I couldn’t figure out how guys got washed out like that until I saw a replay today. Pierre-Paul was lined up at DT there and tried to loop around Justin Tuck at LDE. Tuck started to go inside but then either quit because he saw the protection sliding his way or because that wasn’t the call and Pierre-Paul got it wrong. Either way, no pressure on Brady and nothing in the way of his vision and throw is a recipe for disaster. And if not for Manning, Ballard and the rest of the offense, it is a disaster.

We do. New discoveries in the Vatican's Secret Archives, just as I was considering writing this book, revealed the truth of the pope's role in the end of the Templars and revealed the truth about the Templars themselves -- and, no, the Templars were not heretics nor blasphemers, and for what it was worth, they took to the stake and to their graves the pope's blessings and absolutions. But the pope, and indeed the papacy itself, the very independence of the Roman Catholic Church, was under threat from the king of France, a fanatic with totalitarian designs. My book has been the first book to revise the history of the Templars, and revise their afterlife too, in the light of these remarkable revelations.

If I had to characterize the restaurant with just one adjective, I'd choose "civilized." Ammo is one of the very few restaurants where everything works together to create a seamless experience — the food, the unpretentious industrial design, the easy, understated service, the sophisticated music, the alluring wines. If I want to enjoy a great meal with friends, over the last few months, Ammo has become my go-to restaurant.

Hickey died 10 days ago. The funeral is today. He was 82, and in recent years he battled pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and breathing issues. He'd gone on too many ambulance rides to count. And during a weeklong hospital stay prior to this season Hickey told me he kept himself going by thinking, "I wonder how good the Blazers are going to be next season."
A former first-round pick (19th overall) by Cleveland in the 2008 draft, the 6-foot-9 Hickson has shown great leaping ability, unshakable confidence and tenacious effort. All of that was on display in the second quarter when Hickson recorded the dunk of the year for the Blazers. With a running dribble from the right side of the key, Hickson took off and dunked over Clippers center DeAndre Jordan, who is fourth in the NBA in blocks per game. He was so high that the 6-foot-11 Jordan actually nicked him on his elbow while Hickson was nearing the basket. He briefly lost control of the ball but steadied it in time for the dunk.

As Santorum's rise in the GOP field demonstrated, this "I-am-the-real-religious-candidate" strategy works. It worked for Zia-ul-Haq when he won the 1984 referendum by asking Pakistanis, "Do you wish Pakistan to be an Islamic state?" And it seems to be working for Santorum as he is essentially asking GOP primary voters, "Do you wish America to be a Christian state?"

What hypocrisy. What an affront to all the soldiers who fought for our freedom and who fight for freedom for others today. The higher-ups in the campaign can claim plausible deniability all they want, but that just shows the arrogance they have in thinking we don't know the real truth. The real truth is that this was not a "faux pas" or a "political mistake." It was a blatant attempt to take the freedom and right of people to cast a vote. God forbid that the political parties play by the rules.

In the States, when a room is listed as "double occupancy" it often means you're getting two beds. And hotels don't mind having a few extra kids in the room or wheeling a crib in for a baby. But when you're traveling overseas, hotels sometimes see things differently. Either they want to monetize every guest or local fire codes prohibit them from allowing more than two people from occupying the room. Someone should have alerted you to that.

And I have no problem with students protesting. They have absolutely every right to exercise their first amendment rights.
