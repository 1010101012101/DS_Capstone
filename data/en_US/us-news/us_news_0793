Until 1903 prisoners were given burlap bag masks to wear over their heads so they could not see their way to their cell.

Q: Your music is very tween-friendly. With all of those teenage girls in the audience, do you have to hold back a little?
Like the Dutchman himself, the production is entirely redeemed, though here by Edward Gardner's orchestra and the precise, often thrilling, singing of the chorus. The Dutchman is, for once, good-looking enough to explain Senta's obsession with him, and sung nicely by a slightly wooden-acting James Creswell.

State Sen. John Girgenti’s (D-Passaic) hometown of Hawthorne would be cut away from Paterson, giving Assemblywoman Nellie Pou (D-Passaic), who chairs the Legislative Latino Caucus, a clear shot at a state Senate seat.

Kelly School, out in the part of Portland where English and Spanish are just two of many possibilities, has 80 percent of its students eligible for free and reduced-price lunch, and there are Portland and Oregon schools where the number is much higher. (Throughout Multnomah County, 53 percent of schools have more than half their students eligible, qualifying for federal "at-risk" status.)

Most of all, say those who live here, it is a city that still has a small-town feel to it, where people know one another and feel safe walking the streets at night - which may explain why it is also a city that engenders a strong sense of civic pride and protectionism among its inhabitants.

So that’s your receiver in rehab. He’s one of the kids you root for, not because he’s got a great family and an interesting name (by the way, it’s pronounced “Dominique, but he’s too polite to correct anybody,” his dad says), but because we all know that the game owes him one.

It’s physiologically impossible to listen to klezmer music without feeling joy, and this show’s rollicking score — composed and adapted by Hankus Netsky with witty lyrics by Arnold Weinstein, and performed live — is a delight. The highlight is “Geography Song,” featuring a shout-out to that classic Yiddish song, “Romania.” The eight musicians periodically emerge from the pit to play onstage, as if their exuberance simply can’t be contained.
One report suggests so -- a report that has been sitting for nearly a year on the desk of Mayor Dave Bing.

USATF CEO Doug Logan says the Olympic Trials shouldn't be "a destination" for athletes. He wants to get rid of the athletes cluttering up the competition. It's one school of thought. But maybe those athletes cluttering things up in 2008, will be the stars in 2012. Maybe their experience in 2008 will prove an important catalyst in their development. It seems to me, Logan has a pretty myopic view of the process.

Another win: you're not stuck with carrier-installed apps. In the Android world, a preinstalled app is like a case of herpes. You can't get rid of it and you curse the individual who gave it to you.

While the Massachusetts model has succeeded in holding down property taxes there, the law took a harsher toll on lower-income communities and "resulted in cuts to valued services rather than simply calling forth greater efficiency from local governments," according to a 2008 study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning nonprofit group in Washington, D.C.

The central difficulty in dealing effectively with this situation is that the only person with the power to compel Mr. Teare to step down is Mr. Leopold, and the reason that Mr. Teare cannot effectively lead the department at present has entirely to do with the criminal case against the executive. Mr. Leopold cannot be expected to spearhead an investigation into allegations that could point back to himself. Mr. Davis told the council that he has asked theU.S. Department of Justiceto investigate, but there is no indication that it will do so. Furthermore, any such probe would not likely resolve the immediate crisis of confidence in the police department's leadership. Some members of the County Council are backing a resolution calling for Mr. Teare's suspension, but that would not have the force of law by itself. Two county police unions have called for both Messrs. Teare and Leopold to resign, but that has had no effect.

What other choice does a struggling presidential candidate have? No one ever called Newt Gingrich a quitter. And goodness knows he can’t possibly quit the spotlight, even if the big money is coalescing behind Mitt Romney. Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson reportedly gave $16.5 million to a Gingrich super PAC, but it appears Adelson is backing away from the Gingrich-for-president craps table. Now that Newt tapped out his supporter from the 1 percent, he’s turning to the working stiffs in the 99 percent.

A complete run of this most desirable series. The crown jewel of Frank Robinsons collection. The spines are unfaded and beautiful. The paper is as good as it ever gets. A number of these came direct from the original collector and kept in immaculate condition. Ive seen many runs that claim to be the best...and quite honestly this one blows them all out of the water. The early pulp sized issues that had overhang....all have been untrimmed. This is actually a real scarcity, as so many have been trimmed down to the trimmed paper. To actually see this set as it sits on a shelf is a wonder to behold. The blood red spines are a real eye-opener. The overall condition is VF.

No one knows how the court will rule. The justices, we are reminded, don't always vote as they question. But it would be best if Congress could be given a clean slate.

Or take marriage. At his Saddleback Church, wifely submission is official doctrine: The church website tells women to defer to their husband's "leadership" even when he's wrong on important issues, such as finances. Never mind if she's an accountant and he flunked long division, or if she wants to beef up the kids' college fund and he wants to buy shares in the Brooklyn Bridge. The godly answer is supposed to be "yes, dear." Is elevating this male chauvinist how President-elect Obama thanks women, who gave him more than half his votes?

Dolores Hidalgo (Guanajuato): Boasting some of the colonial charm found in nearby San Miguel, Dolores Hidalgo is somewhat reminiscent of San Miguel 30 years ago. The smaller, quieter town claims the title of cradle Mexican independence: On Sept. 16, 1810, Father Miguel Hidalgo — arguably Mexico's most revered hero, rivaled only by Benito Juárez — rang the church bells and urged parishioners to overthrow Spanish rule in what is known as the "Grito de Dolores" (Cry of Dolores).

In 2008, a suite of 10 Indian paintings was given to the museum by Southern California collectors Dr. Narendra and Rita Parson.

I would have written Travelocity immediately to alert them of the overcharge, and if I didn't hear back, I would have gotten in touch with US Airways. By the way, I'm not sure your new tickets would have been canceled if you'd questioned your credit card charges with your bank. Formal credit card disputes take a long time to work their way through the system. You probably would have used the ticket long before US Airways had a chance to cancel it.

But Fickell deserves credit for preventing a victimization mindset among the remaining players. They were sabotaged, not so much by the NCAA, as by their own teammates.

The NCAA requires that a player remove his name from the draft list and announce his intention to come back to school by “the first day of the spring National Letter of Intent signing period,’’ or April 10.

Yet just a week ago, Romney started the process of "softening his tone" on illegal immigration -- he reportedly told supporters at a fundraiser that he would consider a Republican version of the DREAM Act. It appears he might be distancing himself from Kris Kobach, the author of "papers please" legislation adopted by Arizona and Alabama, downgrading him from "adviser" to "supporter."

Be certain from this point forward that your dog knows you are not a member of his species and toss the whole dominance thing out the window right now.
