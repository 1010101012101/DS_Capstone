Mr. Troxel might sound like a member of a focus group that gave Acura's marketing department the template for its target customer profile. But he's 65 years old—a baby boomer, just like most of the people who buy new cars in the U.S. And while he likes the concept of an economical luxury car, he is on the lookout for telltale shortcuts that betray a car's cheaper origins.

To which I reply: At any given time, the TV schedule has considerable acreage of vast wasteland, to dust off another vintage expression. But the mere existence of such intelligence-insulting sideshows as "Toddlers & Tiaras" doesn't somehow transform "Mad Men," "Justified," "Community" or any number of terrific series into toxic byproducts.

Minnesota won’t host another Super Bowl, Final Four or any other national event without a new stadium. You saw the roof collapse on the Metrodome a year ago. Would you step foot in the building? I sell professional services for one of the largest IT consulting firms in the world. When I speak to people outside Minnesota, they think of three things: The Mall of America, cold weather and the Vikings. Without the Vikings, we are just a cold state with a big mall. Never mind that Minnesota is home to more Fortune 500 companies per capita than any other state.
The system relies on companies to make employees aware of coverage and to report deaths and injuries to insurers and the federal government. But some employers have shirked those obligations, and the U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees the program, has done little to ensure compliance, punish violators or reach out to injured foreigners or their survivors.

Our sports teams either squat in pathetic muck all season long or take us to the brink of glory before smashing our hopes into tiny shards of tear-shaped glass.

There are no U.S. laws against buying the high-powered assault rifle owned by the alleged Pittsburgh gunman, or other military-style assault weapons being used more often against police and others across the country -- or even the .50-caliber sniper rifles able to shoot down a helicopter.
They can build the most sophisticated, technologically advanced wineries in the world, match them with immaculate, temperate cellars, and employ the most talented winemakers of a generation.

Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver. Three years ago, it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado; located on turf between two rival gangs.

This is Lovett's final album for Curb/Universal, his label since he started making records, which may explain why he seems to be coasting a bit.

Pedigree: Wheat fans rejoice, this is a good one. Very wheaty, with a hint of spice (orange? cinnamon?) and low in alcohol (4.8 percent). Its old-style brewing technique does not involve the usual, giant vertical cylinders you see in brewpubs, but rather a more open process. And don't worry about that sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Even those who don't like wheat should give this a try. It's not overpowering and, like some hoppy ales that can turn off non-ale drinkers, this may pique the interest of wheat novices (like myself). I first tasted wheat beer in the early '90s, and it's still not my cup of tea, er, brew. But this cloudy beer beckoned me to try another. (By the way, in German "keller" means "cellar" and "hefe" means "yeast.")
When Obama does cover those fine arms, the past 100 days have been a veritable ode to the cardigan.

“It’s got some classical elements to it. It’s not your typical Broadway-style music. It’s set in the turn-of-the-century, Victorian era and it’s got that sort of sound to it. It’s not operatic, but it moves in a kind of classical way,” he said.
CheapOair should have offered you a better solution than buying a new, more expensive ticket. I contacted the company on your behalf, and it agreed to buy a new ticket, with Jetstar covering half the difference in airfare and CheapOair picking up the other half.
As much as those like Hoyal — who can run a half-marathon (a little more than 13 miles) in 70 minutes — will add legitimacy to the event, Paris and his partners are just as excited about a local woman in her 70s who plans to walk the half-marathon during the 31/2 hours that the course will be opened.

Those tests determined that baby Clara, their third child, was likely to be a perfectly normal kid inside. But even in the womb, doctors could see severe facial deformities , droopy eyes, under-developed cheekbones and a tiny jaw. It meant she'd need a tube in her neck to help her breathe after birth. The lack of an outer ear and restricted ear canals also would mean she'd have hearing aids by the time she was 6 months old.

But the president has it all wrong. Indeed, speculation cannot be responsible for the steady upward trend in oil prices — a price spike here or a spike there, perhaps. Recent trading in natural-gas futures is a useful illustration. The majority of natural-gas futures recently traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange have been held by speculators. Natural-gas prices, however, are at 10-year lows. Why the discrepancy? Due to enhanced drilling technology, supplies of natural gas have skyrocketed. Speculators in an oil-price benchmark, however, have held less than 50 percent of the futures traded on the NYMEX, and oil prices continue to climb. The lesson: With abundant supply, prices drop, and speculation does not materially affect prices.

"Playboy, moi?" Sachs once asked a reporter, giving collective voice to many of his peers. "I would rather call myself a gentleman." Famous for wooing French bombshell Brigitte Bardot by dropping hundreds of roses onto the grounds of her house from a helicopter (it worked, she married him) and the mock boast that he never worked a day in his life, Sachs left behind a bankroll estimated to be as much as $455 million, a modest sum compared to the billions being made by today's mega-yacht crowd.

So Art pauses in front of the stands, gives Joe the finger and then continues his dribble upcourt.”

It is the position that he spent the most time at in the minors, and there was a time when scouts would say it's his "natural" position. The position isn't the question. It's how would Descalso fare as an everyday starter at any position? The Cardinals don't have to answer that question now.

By the time the camps conclude, Fewell hopes the NFL’s lockout is settled and that he’ll be able to coordinate the Giants’ defense again. The group will be bolstered by the additions of first-round cornerback Prince Amukamara and second-round defensive tackle Marvin Austin.

Evidence of this is the initial goal of $2,000 they had to get to SXSW. In all, $2,700 was raised — and that was quite fortuitous, because Putka’s car broke down before SXSW and the group had to rent a car to get down to Austin. The extra $700 helped make that possible.

Visual presentation is a feature of Thai cuisine  whole watermelons are often carved into a bouquet of chrysanthemums. Nearly every dish is garnished with carrot flowers or cranes and delicate ruffles of kale. Red pepper strips set off the pumpkin-colored, cream-enriched sauce.

Is there any recognition at the absolute highest levels of team ownership/management of two huge sources of future problems ... 1. The Sox have simply been unable to develop an effective farm system under Ken Williams (witness recent Baseball America ratings); and 2. The apparent deficit in organizational talent evaluation that has led to all of the bad trades and free agent signings. Where is the next Al Goldis, who was key to the jackpot of talent the Sox developed in the early '90s (e.g., Thomas, Fernandez, McDowell, Ventura -- even Alvarez through the Himes trade). Now that was a farm system. -- M. Peregrine; Glencoe

Since Armando is played by Will Ferrell, the over-the-top line is played as over-the-top as you would expect - brow furrowed, eyes looking dramatically at the horizon.

They like to talk, but not about themselves. Vera Katz can go on for hours about school funding or campaign finance reform, as anyone who served with her on the City Council in the 1990s or in the state Legislature knows all too well. Mel Katz is not shy about expressing his opinion on art and culture and the petty rules and regulations that stifle the human spirit. What they don't like -- what Vera Katz particularly doesn't like -- is to talk about a difficult childhood that included an escape out of Nazi-occupied France during World War II or a struggle with a rare form of cancer that almost killed in her last year as mayor.

The Church at Pierce Creek case is not even analogous to the Pulpit Initiative. The Pulpit Initiative is not about churches running full-page political ads in newspapers. Indeed, in that case, the church never asserted that placing the ad was part of its free exercise of religion. In contrast, a pastor speaking from the pulpit to his congregation is the "core" of the free exercise of religion. As you must know, no federal court has ever been confronted with a constitutional challenge to the government's restriction on what a pastor says from the pulpit. The point of the Pulpit Initiative is to create a legal precedent that restores the right of pastors to speak freely from the pulpit without government censorship or control.
The agency now gets most of its budget from industry fees, which could be increased to raise more research funding. Santa, however, said the federal government has already increased fees in recent years to pay for pipeline safety grants to states.

Tressel will keep his job, on that Athletic Director Gene Smith and Gee were emphatic. And Tressel said he never thought of quitting. He has been suspended for two games and fined $250,000 by Ohio State, though the NCAA is still finishing its investigation and can impose more sanctions. You must imagine the 2010 season will be vacated since players were on the field while their coach knew they'd broken NCAA rules, and Tressel and the university could face stiffer penalties ahead.

"We Need to Talk About Kevin" fancies itself as a much more serious film than any of the movies I mentioned earlier and this is where the problems begin.

Unlike warfarin, apixaban does not require constant monitoring to insure that the dosage remains within a desired range.
But the way the Senate works is quite the contrary. The Senate has a cozy little custom that allows any member of either party to single-handedly block a governor's nomination to a judgeship or an executive-branch job if the nominee is from the senator's home county. It's called senatorial courtesy, and rare is the member who doesn't take advantage of it at one time or another.

I grew up in Wentzville and have watched it grow as well, but with these trying times we are in we all need to make sacrifices. I agree a quality education in a child's life is very important. But every other school district in St. Charles County is making cuts. I pass by Heritage Elementary every day going to and from work, and they just finished an upgrade on the entrance to the school. They could have saved that money and put it toward another improvement.

Cool and refrigerate if made ahead.
The Dodgers carried a 5-4 lead into the ninth and asked right-hander Francisco Felix to close it. Felix, who last year pitched at triple-A Albuquerque (5.99 ERA), gave up a single, hit a batter and then a game-winning two-run double to Brad Davis for a 6-5 loss. That’s Brad Davis the minor league catcher, not the former Mavericks point guard.

In the 1980s, while non-Angelenos may have assumed that Milliken and Feniger were impressing customers with their exoticisms, the truth was that the chefs assumed most of the people in the dining room had tasted these things in their original form. Not all of their customers had been to Thailand, Lisbon or India, but a lot of them had; if not, Thai Town, Little Tokyo and Little India were not far away. (As Jonathan Roberts' review in the old California magazine read, if you weren't sure what chrysanthemum leaves were supposed to taste like in a salad, you were supposed to pretend that you did.)

This charming kid’s-eye movie, full of comical and vivid detail about the lives of these cheerful children, has the loose, lanky feel of a memoir and of French New Wave films. Writer-director Taika Waititi, who also plays the exasperating, inept and semi-lovable dad, adroitly mixes pathos with absurdity. Like childhood itself, though, the film lacks much of a plot, and somehow manages both to drag on and feel too short at the same time.

Hernandez issued a yellow card to Portland defender Rodney Wallace and awarded the Galaxy a penalty kick after Wallace grabbed Landon Donovan by the neck just inside the penalty box in the seventh minute. The beginning of play started outside the box as the two wrestled for the ball, but the referee called the foul inside the box as Donovan stood and complained vociferously while extending his arms into the air.

There is a cure against racism. The deep wounds can be healed. But the healing process is intricate, deliberate and will require involvement from those who have previously remained silent. When racism raises its ugly head, silence becomes toxic and our apathy is interpreted as total acceptance. We always have a choice: do nothing and let racism go uncontested and flourish, or do something -- act up, rise up and speak up. We must pick up the armor of righteousness daily in order to slay the evil forces of racism at work against us. It will not be easy and it will not always be comfortable for any of us, but courage is a game changer. We must each take a step, each day, to garner support and find our voice as the moral majority. Here are 10 steps we can each take to step out of the shadows of silence:

Mr. Boehner has resisted crafting a plan that will attract any of them out of the realization that it would irreparably fracture his caucus and threaten his leadership. But after his initial failure to round up the 217 Republican votes needed to pass his plan, the speaker surely must realize that it's already too late to avoid that. President Obama, speaking at the White House yesterday morning, pointed out the obvious lesson that Mr. Boehner should have taken away from Thursday's events: "Any solution to avoid default must be bipartisan."

The Cavs tied an NBA record in the 97-92 overtime victory over the Trail Blazers by turning the ball over just twice. The second turnover came in the final seconds as Mo Williams was trying to run out of the clock and a pass at the rim went out of bounds.

A recent letter writer claims that gay marriage has no effect on religious liberty ("Gay marriage does not diminish religious liberty", Nov. 21).

The problem with all this Oscar predicting, however, is not that the pundits are often wrong but, frankly, that they are often right. For the truth about the Oscars is that they are, to a large extent, predictable.

Overall, U.S. light-vehicle sales averaged an annual rate of 14.6 million in the first quarter. At that pace, U.S. auto sales would finish 2012 with their highest total since 2007. At the beginning of 2012, many best-case scenarios had called for 14 million in sales this year. GM is expecting sales to top that level, Johnson said. Ford said it plans to update its sales forecast Wednesday, which currently calls for 13.3 million to 14.3 million light-vehicle sales.
