øA: We have to be more disciplined about doing things that benefit the patient, rather than the physician. We have very perverse incentives. The way our payment system works is if you put more stents on coronary arteries, you make more money. If you do more studies, you make more money. The physicians are largely well-intentioned, but the incentives are driving over-utilization. You're twice as likely to get a CAT scan in the U.S. as you are in most Western European countries. You're twice as likely to have a heart catheterization. Our population isn't that much different.
The scramble began minutes before the start of the draft when the Minnesota Vikings traded the third overall pick to the Cleveland Browns for the fourth selection, a fourth-rounder (118th overall), fifth-rounder (139th overall), and seventh-rounder (211th overall).

Jobs are an important issue in this economy; Wu asked the candidates if any had ever actually created any.
On the six economic issues, we asked readers which candidate would be more likely to take six different steps "to help your pocketbook." Mitt Romney was the choice by a wide margin to "accuse Ben Bernanke of being unpatriotic," "tell Europe to bail itself out" and "start a satisfying but self-defeating trade war with China." Surprisingly (to me, at least), Romney also edged President Obama as the candidate more likely to "offer a tax credit for wages spent on Brazilian blowouts." Obama was the overwhelming choice to "create an entitlement for fresh fruits and vegetables" and a very slight favorite to "declare Facebook 'too big to fail.' "
Already, the U.K.'s Office of Fair Trading has weighed in on this issue, saying it believes there's "a strong case for a change in the law so that the cost of using a debit card, the almost universal payment method for today's online consumers, is always included within the headline price."

Hmmmm, that's a tough one. Most recently, it would be the 7-inch garter snake who slithered through our front doors into our lobby. Or perhaps the 7-foot alligator who was found guarding a warehouse full of marijuana in Cleveland, although he didn't actually end up at the APL as there is nowhere in our facility for a 7-foot alligator! Thankfully, the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo was able to care for him until he could be transported to a sanctuary.

Remove the federal government from the Everglades. How many bureaucrats, biologists and engineers do we need doing the same thing, disagreeing over it, and then suing each other? The state has slashed its restoration budget, spent a fortune on useless land from U.S. Sugar and balked at federal water-quality standards. The feds can't force the state to fix something that even the feds don't know how to fix. The rising sea level will resolve this issue in due time.

The prevailing view was that Navajos and Apaches were Athabascan-speaking Indians who came from what is now northwest Canada and Alaska, down the Rocky Mountains to the present-day American Southwest. Evidence suggests that they arrived around 1450, said David Wilcox, an archaeologist who recently retired from the Museum of Northern Arizona. Until new evidence comes to light, archaeologists are likely to stick with that date.

The Hilberry actors, all Wayne State University graduate students, are surprisingly adept at playing characters old and young. David Sterritt, mostly cast this season in fresh-faced roles, is especially convincing as a middle-aged mission convert. Cochrane assumes the Barbara role with ease and more than holds her own with her self-assured father. As Undershaft, Jones (so impressive in "Richard III" last year) again proves his versatility. Sporting a bit of gray at the temples and a rich man's swagger, he rolls through some of Shaw's most famous lines. Asked to state his religion, he says "millionaire." The two things necessary for salvation? "Money and gunpowder."
With any rehabilitation, try to keep an open, honest dialogue with your physical therapist to help facilitate success. If you're told to do a program that takes more time than you're willing to commit to, it probably will be a waste of time.

It soon became clear that some apps had a cost to privacy. In July 2009, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada investigated Facebook and discovered that it was sharing too much of users' personal data with app makers without informing users.

Despite smashing two franchise records, posting the third-highest rushing game in NFL history and totaling 561 yards in his last three games last season, Jerome Harrison probably begins camp as the No. 2 back behind rookie Montario Hardesty. The second-round pick from Tennessee took advantage of Harrison's absence from most of the off-season practices and impressed coaches with his running ability, instincts and knowledge of the position. Newcomer Peyton Hillis, acquired in the Brady Quinn trade with Denver, also figures in the mix. Considering Hardesty's well-chronicled knee problems, the Browns are likely to follow the NFL trend of using multiple backs. But somebody has to be the feature back and Hardesty and Harrison should battle for the role.

That would sound like a pipe dream coming out of most high school juniors' mouths, but with Gordon, it's a realistic possibility. Despite missing time with mononucleosis, Gordon averaged 22.9 points, 12.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 2.3 blocks this season. Coming on the heels of a strong run with the U.S. U16 national team, the output was more than enough to solidify Gordon's reputation as a can't-miss prospect.

Careless and incompetent people don't care about their affairs anyway; some of them write to you with silly questions. They withdraw money from ATM's after paying to see their balances because they're too stupid and indifferent to keep their accounts balanced. They wildly use debit cards and never balance their checking accounts. They pay the minimum on their credit card balances, and routinely overdraw their accounts. They probably should not use automatic bill payments.

But I think we'd all settle for a rule that says passengers are entitled to a minimum amount of legroom and personal space, whether they're on American Airlines or any other airline.

Joyce Piven has a love affair with the stories of Anton Chekhov — she's staged several adaptations of his work at the theater she and her late husband, Byrne, founded 40 years ago. But though there are delightful moments in "Encores: After the Theatre and Other Stories," directed by Piven and featuring a trio of tales by the Russian master of wistfulness, this 60-minute sampler platter feels a bit thin in execution.

The White House, along with a coalition of liberal and conservative groups and some lawmakers, strongly opposed the measure, complaining that Americans' privacy could be violated. They argued that companies could share an employee's personal information with the government, data that could end up in the hands of officials from the National Security Agency or the Defense Department. They also challenged the bill's liability waiver for private companies that disclose information, complaining that it was too broad.
A bill similar to last year's legislation was referred to the House utilities committee last month. Webb is one of several dozen co-sponsors of the bill, which would allow an electrical utility seeking an early site permit to recover up to $45 million in costs from ratepayers.

Theater veteran Debbie Isitt directs on the shoulders of Guest (there are clear "Best In Show" and "Waiting for Guffman" influences) but does so deftly.

Life span: If you're born in the fall, you may have a better shot at living to a ripe old age. An example: A 2011 report in the Journal of Aging Research compared months of birth of 1,574 U.S. centenarians — people who have lived to 100 or beyond — and those of their spouses, brothers and sisters. "Siblings of centenarians born in September to November have 30 to 50% higher chances to live to 100 years compared to those born in March," says Leonid Gavrilov of the Center on the Demography and Economics of Aging at the University of Chicago, who coauthored the study with his wife, Natalia. He points to a variety of possible causes: maternal nutrition during the last months of pregnancy, seasonal infections, temperature during birth or conception and levels of vitamin D. All may influence the likelihood of health problems later in life.
Hey, Mark: One of the things the Browns liked about Little was his experience at running back at UNC and his style of running "hard" after a catch.

The barge, which has a large dome, was later mothballed in San Francisco. But in 1982 the Navy transferred the vessel to a Lockheed Martin plant in Redwood City, where it served as a drydock for the construction of Sea Shadow, a stealth ship that was used to test naval technology.

4. When Mike Matheny talked about turning up the Cardinals' running game and pushing on the bases this season, I feared he had been spending too much time under the Florida sun during those long spring training days. But the Cardinals have swiped 20 so far; that's tied for 4th in MLB. They've been thrown out 5 times, and the success rate of 80 percent is 4th best. I like the Cardinals' smart approach to this; they have obviously done a good job in scouting opponents to exploit pitchers that are slow to the plate, and catchers that don't throw well. We say that because the Cardinals are getting steals from guys that don't run fast; catcher Yadier Molina is 4 for 4 so far. And Tuesday night, we witnessed the unusual sight of a double steal with Molina as the lead runner and Allen Craig as the trailer. Not exactly Vince Coleman and Willie McGee, eh? Carlos Beltran is 5 for 6, Rafael Furcal is 3 for 3, Jay is 3 for 4. Holliday, Craig and Lance Berkman are 1 for 1. The fast guys are getting it done, but so are the non-fast guys. That tells us that the Cardinals are doing a good job of scouting and calculating their odds.

When the Cardinals brass talks about Jake Westbrook improving upon his inconsistent 2011, they mention the defense behind him and the trust he can show in his sinker. When the Cardinals' players describe how reliant they can be this season on their pitching staff and the return of Adam Wainwright, the need for defense is implied. And when asked about last year's adrift defense, the same name kept coming up as a remedy, because whatever he was bringing during the late run last fall he's expected to bring back.

For a long time I've wanted to play Lawrence Welk. I wanted to do him in something. What happens these days, I get an idea for a character, but I've been doing it so damn long something takes over. And I couldn't play Lawrence. I just couldn't do it. Something else started to emerge, and I just let it happen. What came out was what you see. I love the character. I loved playing him. But it went in a direction that was very different from what I intended.
Eisenhauer said the utility has set about improving its record-keeping efforts and verifying that the documents it has are accurate. "Cost accounting records are one of several ways we track repairs and costs of those repairs," he said.
The Brazilian father of two whose mission it is to win this for his children because the American Dream hangs in the balance must go against a 17-year-old whose mission it is to win because it would bring her "one step closer to my dream of giving back to the community." Did someone tell Ashley this is not a Miss Teen America pageant? They were given the Jordin Sparks/Chris Brown hit "No Air." Ashley got some psyche-out help from Team Christina advisor Jewel, who told her just be herself because Jonathas sounds too much like Usher and Chris Brown to win. Christina's ultimate decision was that she saw more growth potential with Ashley.
The right to bare it all — or at least part of it all — is a matter of equality, she said. But the court ruled women have no constitutional right to leave their shirts at home. In fact, cloaking their breasts is a matter of grave public concern, the judges said.

His anti-Obama arsenal includes not only standard ammunition of the federal health care law, but the less mainstream Agenda 21, a United Nations resolution on sustainable growth that he insists is aimed at taking away Americans' property rights and redistributing their wealth worldwide.

A state task force is recommending a raft of changes to give Maryland homeowners a better shot at avoiding foreclosure and — when foreclosures do happen — to give neighborhoods a greater chance at recovering.
Brown has the advantage of incumbency and is a proven fundraiser and tireless campaigner. But he is already on the receiving end of Republican Party and outside group attacks over spending, the debt and the economy, the latter of which creates a challenge for any swing-state Democrat. The Ohio Democratic Party meantime regularly criticizes Mandel for spending so much of his recent time raising money and looking for his next political opportunity when he had barely begun serving in his current job.
Most hybrids and electric cars meet the new standards, and Schuster said automakers will have to sell a lot more of them to reach compliance in 2016. For the past few years, hybrids have been about 3 percent of U.S. sales. Schuster said that should reach 8 percent when the new standards go into effect.

“A lot of people are tabbing this as maybe a future MLS Cup matchup. It's way too early to suggest anything like that,” RSL defender Tony Beltran said of the showdown five weeks into an eight-month season. “But it's a good chance to measure ourselves against a top team, in a very tough place. … It would be a big statement for us as a club and set the tone for the rest of the year.”

With gasoline, food, entertainment and other commodities getting more and more expensive and our money falling short, this is the time to return to our families, to our neighborhoods, to our stores that are a walk away, to borrowing and bartering, to telling stories as entertainment, to exploring the world outside our doors, to hitching a ride with our neighbor to the grocery store, to calling our mothers for help with the kids, to figuring out how to light a fire and how to bake bread, to learning how to mend our clothes, to rethinking what we really need.

First, the core of the education program uses regional climate-change science connected to regional impacts and focuses on what's unique to San Diego. Increasing temperatures not only affect weather patterns, but impact our water resources, the intensity and frequency of wildfires, heat waves and Santa Anas. These affect our economy, public health and regional planning. Changes in the marine layer, ocean temperature and sea level all directly affect our coast and quality of life in San Diego. Team scientists from Scripps Institution of Oceanography are studying these phenomena, providing cutting-edge science to enhance the education program and allow for more informed, thoughtful decision-making.

As unlikable as Samuel Kent was to many -- not only because of his work as a tough factory inspector but also because of his failings as a father -- Whicher didn't believe he had killed his own youngest son to hide some scandalous affair. Others in the household had motivations, and he looked for clues ("clue," Summerscale points out, derives from the clew of yarn Ariadne gave to Theseus to help him find his way out of the maze once he'd slain the Minotaur) in the family's character -- a puzzle more labyrinthine than the house itself. As Summerscale notes, English families in the mid-19th century were extremely hostile to meddlesome outsiders. During the investigation, a national newspaper editorialized: "It is with this thoroughly innate feeling of security that every Englishman feels a strong sense of the inviolability of his own house. It is this that converts the moorside cottage into a castle."
The show, which ran from 1966 to 1971, featured flowery language, low production values, time warps and a huge following. ABC aired it in a peculiar time slot: afternoons after school. Its vampires, witches and werewolves became the rage with students, and its star -- Jonathan Frid, who played vampire Barnabas Collins, starting in the second season -- became a TV icon. Some serious fans don't even want to see the new movie, concerned that their beloved TV series might become too Tim Burtonized.
Barring an unlikely, last-second breakthrough, the committee is expected to announce Monday that it failed to reach its mandated goal of writing a bipartisan bill to reduce deficits over the next 10 years by at least $1.2 trillion.

The University of Washington study did not determine how many working families have incomes below the Self-Sufficiency Standard. Census Bureau data show that roughly 77,000 people in Anne Arundel County — about 15 percent of the population — live in families with incomes less than 200 percent of the official federal poverty line. (For a family of four, twice the poverty line would be about $44,000.) The census data count the elderly and other categories that were not included in the self-sufficiency calculations for working families.

The regime is also hard-pressed to expand its forces beyond its own usual circles to keep up with the number of protesters. It can no longer rely on the Sunni majority, which makes up more than 70 percent of Syria's population, so it is shuffling the same units around the country to suppress demonstrations -- mostly the Fourth regiment, led by the president's brother, Maher al-Assad, and the Republican Guard. In the absence of other trustworthy options, it has had to rely on Iranian Revolutionary Guards; Shabbiha ("troublemakers"), which are armed gangs numbering in the thousands that deal and smuggle drugs; and Baath Party college students.
Here we have a quarterback who understands wide receivers better than any other prospect in this year’s draft. That’s because he was one for two years at Texas A&M. Tannehill led the Aggies in receptions his freshman year and played there up until the middle of his junior year when he snagged the starting job at quarterback. His ideal size and comprehension skills have seemed to drown out the fact that he’s only had 19 starts under his belt. He’s also struggled against top-tier talent — a 50 percent completion rate against Oklahoma, a 40.8 against Texas and a 59.6 against Oklahoma State. Don’t expect him to come in and start right away.
Well-armed contractors defended the facility as insurgents used rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns to try to attack, the resident said. Several Westerners were injured in the assault, but security managed to contain the attackers, he said. An hour after the attack, only one insurgent remained contained on the compound. The Kabul police chief at the scene said that six people were killed, including one Afghan student and one guard at Green Village.
protected a community is the more they may retain their exclusive religious values, but at the same time their religious values will be less able to impact the outside world and thus less able to render them a "Light unto the nations" or as God put the Jewish mission to Abraham in the book of Genesis, "A blessing to all the families of the earth."

Trailing, 7-3, at halftime, Tressel didn't jump on his players the way he did during an emotional halftime against Penn State last week, when the Buckeyes were down, 14-3. This time, center Mike Brewster said the energy came from the players themselves.
"The Obama administration seems to be using a technicality to sidestep Congress and write itself a blank check to spend more money for political purposes leading into this year's elections," Hatch said in a statement.
The club cited a list of complaints, including insufficient transit funding on the list, lack of a regional transit agency, and legislative inaction hamstringing MARTA. They put forth a "Plan B" that would make gas tax revenues rise with inflation and use that money for more comprehensive transportation planning, including more mass transit.
Zagunis probably is as close to a consensus favorite as anyone can be in a discipline so dependent on athleticism, reflexes and fast-twitch muscles.
"I know we're all looking forward to being a part of Brooklyn and being a part of that project," Johnson said. "I think it's going to help. We're the only team that's in transition like we are. There's a lot of energy and anticipation of us moving there."
The update will likely show a projected deficit of $3 billion or more for the fiscal year beginning April 1, raising the specter of significant budget cuts in a legislative election year, higher taxes, or the use of “one-shot’’ fiscal gimmicks to paper over the shortfall.

As interest rises in the links between religion, spirituality and health, there is a new push to establish chaplaincy in the medical mainstream and apply more rigorous scientific research. The Association of Professional Chaplains, which certifies health-care chaplains, issued its first standards for practice in 2009, including the requirement that chaplains document their work in patient medical records and stay abreast of new research.
Over the weekend, Dayton and Revenue Commissioner Myron Frans reached out to charitable gambling officials to dull growing criticism of the state's $398 million financing proposal. Charities had fought for years to increase their take from pulltabs and bingo, only to see stadium supporters take much of the new revenue to pay for a Vikings stadium.
The top 10, which I'll write about here, had a minor shake-up. Blame it on a mood and the arrival of Harry.

Without a full roster, the Bulls barked at the refs, talked trash on the court and used every self-motivational tactic they knew to gain an edge on the Sixers.
But now the former Green Bay Packer, who missed a chance to play in last year’s Super Bowl, has a chance here. The Giants have one kick return among their greatest Super Bowl plays — Ron Dixon going 97 yards on a kickoff for a touchdown in the 34-7 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV — so why not another?

"The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins has drawn comparisons to classics, such as "Lord of the Flies" and "1984."
But the rest of the game, until a late offensive flurry from the Blues, belonged to Coyotes.
The Gulletts' inspiration for the riserva is Cepparello, the signature sangiovese from the Tuscan estate Isole e Olena, one of the properties the Gullets visited in 1985. In being made solely with sangiovese, Cepparello is a departure from traditional enological practices in Chianti Classico; thus it generally is referred to as a Super Tuscan. Stylistically, Cepparello is beefier than Chianti Classico generally, but nevertheless reinforces the region's reputation for wines immediately approachable, graceful and long.

The first half ended on a LaMichael James fumble as the Ducks were driving and at the USC 9-yard lie. An apparent touchdown pass from Oregon quarterback Darron Thomas to De'Anthony Thomas was called back when referees ruled the receiver was out of bounds when he made the catch. One play later, James was hit hard on his dicey right elbow and the ball popped out and was recovered by USC.
The bill's sponsor, Del. Samuel I. Rosenberg, a Baltimore Democrat, says the idea for the fine arose after a Baltimore Sun investigation found hundreds of city owners were receiving breaks on multiple homes in violation of state law.
And rock 'n' rollers haven't been forgotten by the Florida Film Festival, which has an impressive slate of music-oriented films in this year's lineup, starting with the look into the hearts of Rick Springfield fans in "An Affair of the Heart," the world premiere elevated by the presence of Springfield himself for a Q&A session.

Part of the problem is the personnel around Sullinger. The Buckeyes, with guards Lenzelle Smith Jr. and Aaron Craft in the starting lineup, play three-on-five at the offensive end of the floor. Someone besides Craft has to get the ball to Sullinger, and the other two starters, William Buford and Deshaun Thomas, are responsible for the most ill-advised, itchy-trigger-fingered 3-pointers late in games of the season -- Buford at Indiana and Thomas against Wisconsin.

Am I the only one insulted by the charade of the Big Three chief executives pleading their cases before congressional leaders who don't even understand that investment in green technology and measures to avoid financial collapse in the short run are completely at odds?

A major problem is the growing inadequacy of the gas tax, which hasn’t been raised since 1993. As cars become more efficient, people need less fuel and pay less into the Highway Trust Fund.

The latest extension, for only 90 days, occurred at the end of last month.

"If you can achieve good numbers without medication, you have my blessing," Nathan says. "But if you need insulin, you'll be much healthier with it than without it."

"I thought the third quarter was the game," said Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau. "In the first 5 minutes they were into us. We took tough shots. We did not have floor balance.

I think the Browns will take a long, hard look at two top QB prospects with their fourth overall pick: Baylor's Robert Griffin III and Texas A&M's Ryan Tannehill. Most folks know about Griffin because he won the Heisman and is a human highlight film with speed and athletic ability. But Tannehill is an intriguing prospect, one who would fit the Browns' West Coast system perfectly. He's 6-4, 222 pounds with a big arm -- good zip and accuracy. He played for former Packers head coach Mike Sherman, who was an assistant under Browns President Mike Holmgren in Green Bay and Seattle. He played in a pro-style offense very similar to what the Browns run. I wouldn't be surprised if this is their man.
The main square, the Jardín Unión, is only a triangle and barely a city block long on each of its three sides. It's outlined by tightly trimmed laurel trees, some fancy hotels and outdoor cafes.
It may be early to celebrate. Part of the apparent success stems from shifting offenders to local jails, and to some degree, from the early release of others. We await the consequences; hopeful the effects are not felt in soaring crime rates in some communities.

Supplement skeptics often point to the story of vitamin E, which was once considered a promising tool for cancer prevention. The National Cancer Institute was so hopeful that vitamin E supplements would decrease rates of prostate cancer that in 2001 it funded a study designed to test the theory.

In Illinois, Catholic Charities can no longer place children in foster care or place children for adoption because only organizations willing to place children in homes of gay couples are allowed to be engaged in the placing of adoptive or foster children.

"To me the difference between Trayvon and Ramarley is the fact that the crime was committed by a police officer, and Trayvon's was committed by a citizen purportedly acting under a different set of laws.

Sports Stats (now STLhighschoolsports.com), the true north for high school stats in the area for the last three decades, didn't even bother to tally end-of-the-year numbers on treys in 1987-88. Its stats for the trey's second season, however, indicate that non-believers far outnumbered the "Fire away!" crowd. Cardinal Ritter, John Burroughs, Hazelwood West, Principia, Clayton, Francis Howell, Howell North, Parkway Central and St. Louis U. High each shot fewer than 110 threes that season. McCluer was the area's least adventurous team, tossing up only 51 attempts in a 19-9 season.

I was a little surprised that one of my favorites, the Moscow Mule, was made with lemon juice instead of the lime juice that I'm used to. Served in a handled glass jar, it was still very refreshing but a little too lemony for my taste.

Many of us who thought that Chavez would win the Oct. 7 elections thanks to a combination of a massive use of state resources to buy votes, a virtual monopoly of the air waves and intimidation of opposition voters will have to rethink our forecasts. Chavez may still win, but it's not that sure anymore.

After jumping ship in 1985, Brown became, for a brief time, one of the biggest solo pop stars in America. His combination of forceful, masculine singing, enthusiastic dancing and passable rapping made him a model that other male pop stars attempted (and still attempt) to emulate. “Don’t Be Cruel,” the 1988 album for which he’s best known, spun off several smashes, including the strutting “My Prerogative,” the Michael Jackson-biting “Rock Wit’cha” and the fiery “Every Little Step.” “On Our Own,” the theme song to the 1989 film “Ghostbusters II,” continued that winning streak.

Meeting a hunky divorced man (Geoff Stults) at a club, Kim tries to up her desirability quotient by claiming her baby is actually Deena's, thereby enlisting her friend in a series of wacky scenarios to maintain the ruse. This dilemma — which arrives far too late in the film to feel like its central conflict — becomes the film's biggest stumbling block, invested as it is with no more personality than an average midseason sitcom plot. The "Must See TV" style is augmented further by the addition of wacky roommate Laura (Rachel Bilson), a virginal Christian with a job as a nude sushi model, given nothing more interesting to do than walk around in skimpy outfits, looking confused.
Their scheme, which you should discover for yourself, involves their interaction with a blunt-speaking Peasant Woman (Samantha Van Sant), who visits the monastery to venerate its relics; and this woman's daughter, Marie (Sydney Kleinberg), and son-in-law, Jack (David Brasington), who are anything-for-a-laugh minstrels.
"There had been times before (in the 1930s) when (Franklin) Roosevelt had huge majorities in Congress, but after the Southern Democrats decide no more New Deal legislation is going through, no more New Deal legislation goes through," Caro says, adding that obstruction lasted into the 1950s, until Johnson became majority leader.

She recommended that I follow the designated trail to Sunrise for about a mile and a half to a junction with Tioga Road, which bisects the park.

But as much as Knicks fans are looking for a hero, it's important to remember this is a player who had surgery at the beginning of the month. To expect Lin to return to form in the first week of May is unrealistic and potentially dangerous to the young man's career. After all, Lin is a restricted free agent this summer and any further injury to his knee could cost him millions of dollars.

The buildings were torn down when the fair ended -- all but one. That was Bernard Maybeck's Palace of Fine Arts, designed to look like a ruined temple. It was too beautiful to destroy, and it stands still, like a memory of an older San Francisco.
"I said to a couple of the barbers that my chair was shaking and they laughed it off," Baker said. "Then one of the barbers went outside and saw that people were coming out of the courthouse and standing around. Then he came back in and said, 'Maliek, you're right. It was an earthquake.'"

Harry Crews, a rough-hewn Southerner who drew a keen following with novels that describe a Hieronymus Bosch landscape of grotesques — characters who are tossed into rattlesnake pits, walk on their hands, croon lullabies to a skull and literally eat a car — died Wednesday in Gainesville, Fla. He was 76.

"Look, I can't say much because I know when we faced him he was hurt," said Swagerty, whose Sun Devils defeated Cox's Arkansas Razorbacks in the Super Regional. "He's a very tough out.

The win wasn’t easy for Fieldston (6-0, 4-0) as Riverdale (1-4, 1-3) boasted its own ace in Cole Dreyfuss. Dreyfuss was solid throughout, and if not for a rough defensive first inning for Riverdale, the game easily could have gone the other way.
The front steering recall covers minivans from the 1999 to 2003 model years. The rear axle recall includes vans from model years 1998 through 2003. Both are in addition to recalls that were announced earlier.
Beyond this evidence of administration disorder, however, the United States and its NATO partners must agree on our fundamental strategic objectives in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is what Obama should have done before his March announcement, and must in any event get right now. Afghanistan's corrupt Aug. 20 presidential election is no excuse for second thoughts; the administration should have understood Afghanistan better and factored the risk of corruption into its original decision - or should have done more to head it off. Apparently, it did neither.

16. QB Colt McCoy: No bones broken, but confidence and emotions frayed.
On the first 48 tries, mistakes by dogs or humans stopped the work short. They got all the way through take 49, but they wanted to improve it so forged ahead to shoot 124 takes over four days. Around the 50th try, the dogs were so used to their parts they sped up and trainers had to spend time correcting them. The group decided on take 72 for the video.
This summer will also mark a reunion for Horton and Serrano. The current Vols head coach played for Horton at Cerritos in 1985 and then joined Horton's staff as an assistant coach in 1988. Serrano took over head coaching duties in 1991 when Horton left for Augie Garrido's staff at Cal State Fullerton. After a stint at Tennessee, Serrano went to Fullerton in 1997 to serve as pitching coach and recruiting coordinator for Horton who had been named Titan head coach the same year. Serrano then replaced Horton as Cal State Fullerton skipper in 2008.

On the palate, it's less sweet than the nose would suggest — in fact, hoppier than sweet, with a long, dryish, medium-bitter finish. Big Bear Black Stout actually registers 55 International Bittering Units, which is well up in IPA territory, though it's not as bitter as many a West Coast insane IPA (if you're in the mood for insane hoppiness, try Bear Republic Brewing Co.'s Red Rocket Ale). It's also fairly strong, 8.1% alcohol.

You might ask yourself: Why would anyone want to be married on Halloween or celebrate a Halloween-themed wedding? The truth is, a lot of couples choose Halloween simply because of the gorgeous fall weather, while others love the quirkiness of the holiday. But how do you maintain the elegance while at the same time avoiding the potentially creepy?

1910: Author Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, died in Redding, Conn., at age 74.
Now, even if we provide these affordable options, there may be those - particularly the young and healthy - who still want to take the risk and go without coverage. There may still be companies that refuse to do right by their workers. The problem is, such irresponsible behavior costs all the rest of us money. If there are affordable options and people still don't sign up for health insurance, it means we pay for those people's expensive emergency room visits. If some businesses don't provide workers health care, it forces the rest of us to pick up the tab when their workers get sick, and gives those businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors. And unless everybody does their part, many of the insurance reforms we seek - especially requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions - just can't be achieved.
“They sold me on, it’s a way of getting guys going in the morning,” McMillan said. “So this is what we warm up to, and they’ve been good.”

Bernardsville mayor Lee C. Honecker said he did not know either Graham-Hawthorne or her husband.
Bernal Heights was developed in 1839 as part of a Mexican land grant belonging to Don Jose Cornelio Bernal. The construction of the freeway at the end of the 1940s isolated the neighborhood, and by the 1980s, it was dilapidated. Much like Hayes Valley, Bernal Heights has since cleaned up and is home to bohemians who abhor chain stores. Once a lesbian mecca, the neighborhood -- with Cortland Avenue as its focus -- is now a haven for young families and dog owners.
Manila (Bud) Shaver had been told that the vehicle might have been used in a home invasion in Hudson, Wis., involving his daughter's boyfriend, according to police documents obtained Thursday.

If you've tried to downsize Mom to no avail - self-improvement can be a hamster wheel of its own - then, OK, just write. Write until your momentum gains the strength to withstand even Mom. Then say, "Hey Mom, I'm writing a book." You can even decline to provide details with, "It's not a sure thing yet, so I'll tell you as soon as it is" - and tell her as soon as it is.
Mr. Allison said -- and I quote -- 'The Governor likes to reward people who share his views on issues.' When I refused to vote for the bill for a fourth time, Mr. Allison said, 'I'm prepared to make a deal right now.'
The exchange rates of the countries joining the euro zone probably more or less reflected the economic reality at the time when the euro was born. However, over the last decade, the economic performance of euro-zone countries diverged and the negative effects of the "straight-jacket" of a single currency have become more and more visible. When "good weather" (in the economic sense of the word) prevailed, no visible problems arose. Once the crisis (or "bad weather") arrived, the lack of homogeneity manifested itself very clearly. In that sense, I dare say that—as a project that promised to be of considerable economic benefit to its members—the euro zone has failed.
Atlanta school officials, in a short statement issued by their spokesman, said they will cooperate fully. “APS welcomes the governor’s call for a special investigator to look into this matter,” they said.
The house is a perfect backdrop for music and entertaining, painted in comic book bright colors with comic-inspired art at every turn. As a model builder, Rick enjoys creating 3-D art pieces, including wood cutout art. He has a series of cartoon figures adorning the family room windowsill, including Keith Richards as he appeared on "The Simpsons." Rick also makes humorous wind-powered toys, which he displays in the dining room. In the living room, Spiderman scales a "building" that is actually a TV cabinet, and a smaller cabinet featuring a scene from the Lone Ranger stands nearby.
The experience began a little disappointingly. Tomaydo recently had discontinued its Tuesday Tom Tom Kids Nights (which included movies, clowns, games and other entertainment), though had not updated its website or printed menus to reflect this. It also had discontinued the personalized dinner boxes and side of tomatoes for kids, a great disappointment to our tomato-loving tot.

Gov. Bill Owens seized on the development to criticize the "hysterics" surrounding Karr and the waste of tax dollars to bring him to Colorado with such thin evidence.
It's hard to believe that Wadi, 28, has run Saffron Restaurant & Lounge with his brother Saed for almost six years. Though he still wins "young chef" awards, Wadi says, "I'm an old man (by restaurant standards). I've had a restaurant as long as people who are 50."
The introduction of the conspiracy -- about an evil corporation called Northmoor that poisons whistleblowers with radiation -- is hamfisted. We're abruptly thrust into a "Deep Throat"-style meeting between a corporate crony and a fixer-for-hire. In a few handy sentences, they lay out the conspiracy for the viewer. The crony adds, with a straight face, "This has to be cleaned up." Gerber's strained peaches involve less spoon-feeding.
Young said in a statement that as part of the deal, he agreed to not pursue legislation seeking a complete moratorium. Rawlings-Blake said she couldn't agree to Young's initial proposal because her finance and law departments told her it could hurt the city's credit rating. The threat of a home being seized and sold at tax sale often prompts delinquent residents to pay, the administration says.
And he postponed the next hearing in a lawsuit related to possible Open Meetings Act violations until March 29 -- three days after a state-appointed financial review team is supposed to report to Snyder on whether Detroit needs an emergency manager.

Terry D. Schrunk Plaza, to the south of Lownsdale and Chapman squares, has also been closed since mid-November because it periodically part of the Occupy encampment. The federal government owns that property, and it plans to reopen the park Dec. 15.
But Kim's latest restaurant, LàOn Dining, is a swank small-plates place, wedged into a mini-mall between a Vietnamese noodle shop and Don Dae Gam.
