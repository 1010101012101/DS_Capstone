Follow-up “Green Thoughts” refined the approach, and “Only a Memory” became a college radio standard. “11” was tougher and harder, and “A Girl Like You,” a song about surrendering to desire, became the Smithereens’ first Top 40 single, in 1990. Yet the Smithereens were already too old — and perhaps too Jersey-unfashionable — to take a place in the alternative movement shaking up rock.

Buckstein and the Cascade study also refer to heavy burdens on consumers, business and our health care system from our effective pseudoephedrine law; however, they cite no data, studies or reports to back up such an assertion. That is because most consumers simply choose from among the hundreds of cold and allergy products that line store shelves and do not contain pseudoephedrine. Currently, only 15 products and their generic equivalents contain pseudoephedrine, and those have been behind the counter nationwide since 2006.

"My moan is to the disrespectful people who turned left from Brecksville Road into the McDonald's driveway, through the funeral procession for Sgt. Dennis Kancler. I was standing in the median with my flag. Firemen were standing at attention. People were along the road showing their respect to a fallen Marine. Some inconsiderate people couldn't wait to get their lunch. I was appalled that they did that to any funeral procession, let alone one for a hero."

Ripken: Working with kids. It's kind of funny. I joked as a baseball player, when you have a career in baseball, you never have to grow up. If you look at the players around, you have many examples of that. I always felt like a kid. My job was actually playing a game. You're almost insulated from growing up to real responsibility. I think what keeps you young is to keep that mind-set that you're still a kid, you're still aspiring, you're still learning, you're still energetic and curious about everything you do.

We've already covered the brilliance of the 2009 German Rieslings (lots more on that at sfgate.com/ZKNV), but they've now had time to arrive in the Bay Area.

You could throw a rock and hit a great Riesling in '09, so why not share the bounty?

In Bill McClellan's column Sunday chronicling the medical issues of Brandon Norton Mr. McClellan takes us through all of the insurance problems since Brandon's father lost his job when the Chrysler plant closed. He seems to point at the insurance industry as the problem. I see it differently. The problem is the Chrysler plant closed. Further, the Chrysler plant closed because the trucks and minivans they built didn't sell well in a world of $4/gal gas and tough corporate fuel economy regulations. The $4/gal gas and tough CAFE standards are a capitulation to environmental activists and their Democrat politicians who have stopped just about all oil development in this country and want to force us to drive something far smaller than the trucks and vans that Brandon's father used to build. If there is a villain in this story it's not the doctors or the insurance company, it's the EPA and the liberals who have placed their pursuit of dubious environmental goals ahead of Ken Norton's job.

Reductions get harder from here. Some of America's most expansive military commitments are not made in the Middle East but rather in the military's health care, compensation and retirement systems. Health costs in the defense budget have risen from $19 billion in 2001 to more than $50 billion today. The military retirement system is appropriately generous. But the possibility of retiring at age 37 with full benefits -- following 20 years of service -- seems generous beyond normal bounds.

That has come out only because the Immigrant Rights Clinic at New York University challenged the government's statement after the fact.

Conway was particularly upset at Bannister for questioning whether Brown was working as often as she should and for requesting Brown's access card records that showed when she entered and left the courthouse.

One problem, says Huffman: Primary care physicians and medical specialists rarely have partnerships that would make a mental health professional easily accessible to their patients. So, many patients who could benefit from behavioral guidance and psychotherapy don't get it. In an interview, Huffman said that may start to change with research such as that published this week, and as more "collaborative care" practices spring up, encouraged by provisions of the new federal healthcare lawt. Such practices would integrate the mental health care and medical treatment of patients with chronic diseases and complex health issues.

Over and over again, the car seems to be waiting on the tires to regain purchase.

MOLINA ON THE MOVE II (5): With 29 career stolen bases, Molina has run up to second place in the franchise's history when it comes to catchers doing what they're paid to stop: steal bases. Since 1901, the only full-time catcher with more stolen bases than Molina is Jimmie Wilson, who stole 41 from 1928 to 1933. Wilson was a standout soccer player who had a long career at catcher in the majors, but his Cardinals fame isn't any of the runs he made around the bases but the run he made across the diamond. Wilson was traded during a game from Philadelphia to St. Louis and there are reports that he started the game in one jersey and finished it on the bench in the other jersey. Given that it's unlikely that will happen to Molina, he can catch Wilson's franchise mark.

Ferguson said he recommended that Kosiba be declared "ineligible to do business with the city" but that didn't happen and his office "is taking steps to seek a further review of this matter."
That's not fair. Blagojevich's battles with the General Assembly were long, exhausting wars that wound up putting the state deep into a gaping fiscal hole. As bad as things are in Illinois, we're now in infinitely better fiscal shape. Also, Quinn has a real heart, not Blagojevich's cynical proclamations of universal love.
He said the center was the city’s largest financial issue because it does not pay for itself, it was built with borrowed money the city is repaying, and it has had costly repairs.

Global Intermediate did not incorporate until mid-December, when it filed paperwork in Delaware through a third-party incorporation service, shielding the identity of the firm's agent. The group's bare-bones website, whose domain was registered on Feb. 13, does not list the name of the firm's principals. The mailing address listed for Global Intermediate on the super PAC's FEC filings turned out to be the location of a UPS store in downtown Washington.
What in the good name of Les Schwab is going on at the clover-leaf intersection connecting 26 and 217 in Washington County? Two simultaneous crashes caused hour-long delays in both directions last Tuesday afternoon. On another day: four crashes within 20 minutes. ODOT blames it on wet roads and a few drivers who apparently mistook the loops for a NASCAR track. Heed your speed, especially in the rain.
Ford spokeswoman Marcey Evans said 155 Ford jobs have come back to Ohio in the past two years. Most of those have been at the Sharonville transmission plant near Cincinnati.

Those positioning themselves to crown the next generation with its name include everything from marketing specialists to demographic experts to trade publications to trend gurus. Since the early 1900s, we've gone in roughly two-decade-long socio-groupings, from the GI Generation to the Silent Generation to Baby Boomers to Gen Xers to Millennials. Whatever you call it, the still-forming generation of young folks whose birth dates roughly begin around 1995, will be the technically savviest ever.

Still unclear is where Republicans will find the funds to make up as much as a $100 billion shortfall between gas tax and other transportation tax revenues and what they are proposing to spend. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, suggested last month that royalties from expanding oil and gas development might be one way to find the money, but any proposal along those lines is likely to draw strong opposition from Democrats on environmental grounds.

It turns out, however, that Hazell can’t quite score that prolifically playing with one-hand figuratively tied behind his back. Playing with a gash on his shooting hand mysteriously suffered in the St. John’s game that required eight stitches, Hazell hit only 2 of 10 shots and scored just nine points as No. 8 West Virginia beat the Hall, 75-63, Saturday before 11,816 fans at WVU Coliseum.
Here's a clip of Whitney Houston from that Welcome Home Heroes show doing "How Will I Know," which will always be my favorite of her songs. It was written as an appeal to Aretha Franklin's wisdom ("I'm asking you, 'cuz you know about these things"), and at Norfolk, it seemed like Aretha was answering back through Whitney. And that bright yellow suit -- complete with yellow boots -- she had on was awe-inspiring, and amazingly late '80s. It was like a sartorial expression of Rick Astley's personality.
Li, who is studying to be a nurse at City College of San Francisco, has been held in an Arizona detention center since early October. His lawyers expect him to be released and reunited with his parents before they are sent back to China.
As is the case with Herman Melville's 1851 novel on which it is based, "All Girl Moby Dick" doesn't really kick in until Ishmael and Queequeg board the whaling ship Pequod and meet that wack-job extraordinaire, Captain Ahab, played here with a wonderfully unstable, stump-legged, bug-eyed sense of purpose by Amy Harmon.

The Missouri bill opposed by Wyatt is sponsored by several Republicans, and would prohibit any "instruction, material or extra-curricular activity" on sexual orientation from being part of public school teaching, except in studying human reproduction.
Tiger started the fitness craze on the PGA Tour, among other things. Everyone on the Tour works out and eats roughage these days. Well, not Darren Clarke, but someone has to represent the Guinness and Montecristo crowd. Now, despite impressive distance by Woods in the heat this week after his latest injuries healed, the kids have still outdriven him often enough that his mystique has diminished.
A summary of Dooley's military service record provided by Army Human Resources Command at Fort Knox, Ky., shows that he was commissioned as a second lieutenant upon graduation from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in May 1994.

I would rather use that first-round pick on a defensive end than a wide receiver if all things were equal. The foundation of most great football teams usually is big men. And linemen tend to be safer picks than wide receivers. Upshaw might not be a bad pick, but I think Whitney Mercilus or Nick Perry would be better ones.

Throughout Davey's long climactic monologue, a speech that deeply unsettles Anita, she sits unmoving, frozen. Emotions may be welling up within, but Anita keeps them tightly bottled up. Only at the end of the speech do we see her almost unconsciously brushing tears off her cheeks with quick flicking hand gestures. When she does break shortly thereafter, it is for one brief instant, and then again Anita reins in all her overwhelmingly painful emotions.

This stalwart R&B act formed in 1958 delivered a string of hits with soulful fervor. Although the O'Jays hail from Northeast Ohio, their hits – including the 1973 chart-topper “Love Train” – became synonymous with “Philadelphia soul” or “Philly soul,” a brand of R&B defined by sleek grooves and lush orchestrations. Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, the Manhattans and Billy Paul were among the artists who popularized the subgenre in the '70s, when it was perfected by the production team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Massey left in 1971. Powell died of colon cancer in 1977. He was replaced by Strain, who left in 1993. The O’Jays continue to record and to tour, with founders Levert and Williams joined by Eric Grant.
The criminal case that Polanski was fleeing never went away, as his recent arrest in Zurich attests.

Hey, Dennis: There will be picks for sale next month for two reasons. One is teams are looking to save money and selling a draft pick is a way to help pay for free agents. The other is because teams looking to clear salary-cap space may be looking to avoiding spending on rookies and may look to dump picks for future selections. In his meeting with the media, Dan Gilbert said he would consider acquiring or buying picks. However, these types of deals likely don't take place until draft day.
The street's yellow and white striping wore off long ago, "to the point you have no idea where the lanes are," e-mailed the Solon man. Basically, driving Green amounts to a guessing game. The big problem, judging from Holub's report, is that some contestants appear to be really bad at playing.

Also this week, a Vatican spokesman called "encouraging" a communication from the SSPX, a schismatic ultra-traditionalist group formed by the late "rebel archbishop" Marcel Lefebvre. In 2009 Pope Benedict XVI lifted the excommunications of four bishops ordained by Lefebvre, including Richard Williamson, who has said the historical evidence is "hugely against" the deliberate gassing of 6 million Jews by the Nazis. (The Vatican said the pope wasn't aware of Williamson's views about the Holocaust when he lifted the bishop's excommunication.)

We also asked consumers to rate light quality - yes, these technologies produce light you'll actually like.

He did not play because of a knee sprain suffered in spring practice.
"I have to tell you that over the course of several years as I have talked to friends and family and neighbors when I think about members of my own staff who are in incredibly committed monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together, when I think about those soldiers or airmen or marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained, even now that Don't Ask Don't Tell is gone, because they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage, at a certain point I've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same sex couples should be able to get married." — ABC News interview, May 9, 2012

The private firms developing two major state-sponsored projects say they are trying to take advantage of a little-known element of immigration law that provides green cards to foreigners who invest $500,000 to $1 million in a job-creating enterprise in the United States.

She's contemplating legislation to make the use of investor visas illegal for state projects, saying it sounds like we're selling citizenship and "turning the country over to the Chinese."

Took my stroke back and the ball just settled a little bit. I thought that was the whole point of the ruling change from last year that Webb had incurred. But it turns out the ruling didn't really change anything. It's still a penalty, even though I had nothing to do with my ball settling into a lower spot."
National governments have maintained such rules for centuries, under the rationale: You don't let folks sue us in your courts, and we won't let them sue you in ours.

Adequately diagnosing psychiatric problems in a child requires multiple appointments and teamwork with the family, the school and the child. It requires a physician to stand up and say "no" to free gifts from drug companies and to critically review well-designed studies for appropriate assessment and treatment approaches. It requires our society to demand a healthcare system that affords access to appropriate levels of care, a system led by physicians who have demonstrated their commitment to the Hippocratic oath over financial gain. It requires the American people to take responsibility for their health and not expect pills to solve everything.
With Syracuse and Pittsburgh's defection, the Huskies are the remaining dominant power in the Big East Conference in men's (and women's) basketball and the men are the defending national champions. One person familiar with the Catholic schools' thinking said that if a major split occurs and UConn isn't immediately gobbled up by another conference, the basketball-only schools would try to appeal for them to stay in the league.

The roll call here only includes Democrats because Democrats are the ones who voted "yes" and passed what is widely known as Obamacare, formally called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The measure had to come up for votes several times as it took shape in the 100-member Senate, and some votes were merely for the purpose of cutting off debate. It took 60 votes to do that; anything short of that would have effectively killed Obamacare through the equivalent of a filibuster.
