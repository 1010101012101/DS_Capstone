In the closing moments of regulation, it appeared Arapahoe's Jack Bobzien had thrown away a late chance, only to go to the basket, make the short bank shot, then can the free throw to give the Warriors the lead — for only the third time in the game — at 61-59 with 11.1 seconds left in regulation.

Before Monday's game, Calgary honored former defenseman Al MacInnis, who won a Stanley Cup and was named the MVP of the 1989 finals as a member of the Flames. MacInnis' No. 2 was not retired, as it has been in St. Louis, but instead included in the "Forever a Flame" program.
Altman explains he was looking to make "Gosford" the antithesis of the British period piece: "I just wanted to make it sloppy… I wanted to put the audience on notice, right off the bat, that they have to pay attention." Of his films, which include the black comedy of "MASH" and the biting commentary of "Nashville," Altman would say: "I'm always shocked when I finish a film and show it and they don't make me king of the world. But then recently when I saw who they did make king of the world I said, 'Thank God for that. I don't ever want to make that picture.'" Easy enough to guess who that jab is aimed at.

At the summit you'll find several picnic tables and lots of interpretive signs detailing the history of the observatory, which is a fenced-off, two-story tin shed.
A 1-ounce serving – about 15 chips – contains about 150 calories. A serving of fries, on the other hand (defined as 10 fries baked in an oven with no salt added) has 127 calories. Getting a little more real, we find that a medium-size order of McDonald's fries has 370 calories. (We know nutritionals involve a lot more than calories, but we're sticking to this one item for comparison.) So a bag of chips is a veritable nutritional bargain compared to those fries.
Gambino, for his part, said that if the IRS really wants to ensure that tax returns are prepared properly, it would be better served to simplify the tax code. He said he'd support measures that increased transparency for consumers, so they could see whether a preparer had a history of incorrect returns or audits. But he doesn't think the new IRS regulations will really help.

Mike Acker: In less than two full seasons, Marcus Camby has become an emotional leader and a far and away fan favorite. For those reasons, I feel like you have to keep him. He’s getting older, clearly, and is very likely nearing the end of his career; I wouldn’t be against Camby retiring as a Blazer. Camby will probably factor in trade scenarios, and Portland will have to think long and hard about dealing him if the right offer comes along. I think the team can really only deal Camby if it means getting back a contributing big. The Blazers played all of last season with basically one center, minus a few games when Joel was still a Blazer and Camby was healthy. They can’t do that again next season, and they definitely can’t play with zero centers.
The permit process is relatively simple: The state requires 10 hours of in-class training, two hours blasting away at paper targets on a range, and a certificate from Houser or another instructor approved by the National Rifle Association or the Ohio Peace Officer Training Commission.

But maybe protecting children wasn't the chief concern. Maybe officials were more worried about how these lessons would be perceived, and that such activities, coming so soon after Berndt was arrested, would raise concerns. They might. This would be the perfect time for the district to educate parents about what types of behaviors they ought to be concerned about — butter on crackers wouldn't generally be among those — and, just as important, how to make sure district officials are taking their complaints seriously when something really is amiss.

The issue is whether Ohio State had reason to act when it came to Talbott's access to the team; whether his continued presence around the program led to any NCAA violations that could have been prevented; and whether those at Ohio State committed potential violations if they failed to follow up on information.
Allen wrote that former coach Rick Adelman "tied our younger players to the bench and stuck with the tight rotation of veterans who had gotten us to the Finals." He had much harsher words for former general manager Bob Whitsitt, who presided over a controversial, expensive era -- with Allen's backing. Both desperately wanted to win a title, and Allen wrote that he finally gave up on Whitsitt's approach when Whitsitt told him "half our guys are normal and half our guys are crazy. The good guys are all freaked out, but the crazy guys are crazy, so they're fine."

There are many different styles of Zins made today. The old way was almost a bathtub method: open, hot and wild fermentation resulting in almost portlike qualities.

Tennessee (20th Pick) - The Titans are an intriguing team heading into the 2012 season. They drafted their future quarterback in Jake Locker last year and with runningback Chris Johnson and wide receiver Kenny Britt in the fold, the offense has a chance to be explosive. On the defensive side of the ball, there are a few more question marks. Tennessee ranked 31st in sacks last season, so if a player like Quinton Coples falls in the draft, the Titans would likely snag him or might look to another pass rusher like Nick Perry out of USC. They could also decide to upgrade at the defensive back position. Tennessee had just 11 interceptions in 2011, and no player had more than 2. Add that to the fact that the team lost the feisty Cortland Finnegan to free agency, and it's easy to see them going DB with their 1st pick. One name to keep an eye on would be Dre Kirkpatrick out of Alabama. He played only 3 seasons with the Crimson Tide, but started all 3. Not to mention that Nick Saban has a reputation of preparing defensive backs well for the next level. In the later rounds, look for the Titans to try to get younger on the offensive line and add some depth at the receiver position.

While we cannot keep such poison out of a free press, we ought to make certain that this racist narrative never makes it into a courtroom. Should Zimmerman stand trial for killing an unarmed 17-year old boy, Zimmerman's attorneys will likely attempt to continue this narrative. This, as a society, we cannot allow. As the judicial embodiment of our collective conscience, our courts must recognize the inherent wrongness of such stereotypes and the all too tangible harm they inflict upon minorities. If such stereotypes can form the basis of a self-defense claim, there is no deterrent to an individual acting on such stereotypes; whatever may have motivated George Zimmerman when he shot and killed Trayvon Martin. The law can and ought to take a stand against views of the world that are not only disrespectful, but physically dangerous to minorities.
Chocolate mousse is basically egg whites whipped, then folded into melted chocolate that is whipped together with egg yolk, sugar, and rum or other flavoring such as vanilla. Chill until firm, then spoon your way to bliss. This mousse gets pretty firm, so I've opted for the heart of deep darkness rather than creamy sweetness and light. If you wish a little dollop of angelic creaminess, top with a spoonful of whipped cream. This recipe can easily be doubled, tripled or quadrupled.

That's how much private debt-collection companies earned in fees last year from chasing down borrowers on unpaid student loans. With $67 billion of the loans in default, the U.S. Education Department has hired 23 private collection agencies, and their tactics are generating a growing number of complaints to the department. According to a new report by the National Consumer Law Center, the department takes the need to collect loans more seriously than considering complaints in awarding contracts.

She told police it wasn't the first time her parents had used what they called "diaper duty" as punishment for bad grades. The couple were charged with gross misdemeanor malicious punishment of a child. The children were placed in foster care.
An even better reason to have attended the concert was the presence of homegrown superstar soprano Christine Brewer. The power, clarity and agility of her voice were on full display. Without any microphone assist or apparent strain, she soared over the choir and orchestra in Francis Poulenc's "Gloria," which occupied the first half of the program. Ditto for "O Holy Night" and an excerpt from John Rutter's "Mass for Children" that ended the concert. She was a gracious presence on stage and could adjust her voice, as required, from simple eloquence to operatic opulence. This performance also marked the anniversary of her first appearance with the Bach Society 25 years ago.

Veal piccata ($26) was doused in a thick brown sauce that did nothing for the meat. However, when you know what to order, you'll have a meal that's hard to beat. One of those is a House Specialty - grilled calves' liver with bacon and onions ($22.95). It's everything I'd want this dish to be: firm meat, still pink but not raw in the center, caramelized onions that melt on impact, and strips of crisp bacon.
Denis Kelly remembers the era differently. He was managing director of mergers and acquisitions for Merrill Lynch in 1986.

Before the race, Chris Dyson said he looked up from the ALMS paddock near M&T Bank Stadium and was stunned to see hundreds of people lining the roofs of Baltimore's tall buildings.
Some where, some time, someone is going to get hit and seriously injured. I would hope those riding have some kind of insurance to cover any accident either with a pedestrian or vehicle. If not, it should be mandatory for those riding a bike to carry some sort of liability insurance just as those who operate a motor vehicle. And, in and around parks, where there is a large concentration of pedestrian traffic, bicycles should not be allowed to be rode the sidewalk and signs should be posted.

She said: ''Maybe it's because I'm 30 or maybe it's because I'm a mom, but I don't think romance is always about swinging from chandeliers (although it's nice from time to time). It's really about the small gestures too. Recently when filming a movie in Atlanta, Cash surprised me by having a beautiful bouquet of flowers delivered to the set. It was a simple, heartfelt surprise that let me know he was thinking of me during my time away from home. I loved it. He also takes over middle-of-the-night feedings, tends to fevers, and takes the girls to the park without me having to ask because he knows I need a break. All these things add to our romance.''

The reason, I suspect, is that vibration throws off the way your body is used to moving, forcing it to activate small, rarely-used muscles and fire in multiple directions at once, thereby accentuating the natural muscle-building process. In that way, vibration plates also would seem to be an excellent tool for stretching and improving balance.

But Shaw is a brilliant writer too, working in various registers, from delirious vernacular ("We had a thing, a hot second, but I had to 'move-on.org,'" Panther dissembles to one set of persecutors) to bank-shot absurdist patter. ("We've got lots of small evidence," says the sheriff. "What we need is bigger evidence, and evidence that's more colorful. All of this is gray, or of a neutral palette. I prefer yellow or orange evidence, myself.") And when Panther attempts to talk down a fellow experimenter from a dangerous place, there's a heartbreaking purity: "This is how my head is clear. This is how my lungs breathe. This is how my heart is beating, how my body is awake and alive. Are you getting this?"

Perhaps it was Akron Mayor Tom Sawyer and his behind-the-scenes maneuvering with the state legislature. Perhaps it was the determined faces of Goodyear workers and retirees who confronted Goldsmith at a congressional hearing Nov. 18. Perhaps it was the steady, patrician performance by CEO Mercer or the wily tactics of his PR team. Perhaps it was the media, which both educated and riled the public. Perhaps it was something as simple as bags of rubber bands sent to Goldsmith, a prank inspired by White.

Closing a post office has never been a politically popular move. There is a kind of reverse NIMBY (not-in-my-back-yard) effect at work: no one wants to lose the perceived benefits of a local post office. And for members of Congress, post offices are perhaps the oldest form of pork. Many members have been re-elected based on bringing in a post office — which often ends up bearing their name. Few have won an election for closing one.
(On if he still feels the need to acquire future draft picks during the draft)- "We always like to stay where we're at, but if we think we can get a similar type of player and get something for it I just don't understand why not. Why wouldn't you do that? It has nothing to do with building for the future, I think it's just smart. The more draft picks you have the better off you are going to be. Everyone knows it's a crap shoot sometimes. The more chances you have in there the better chances you are going to get a good player. I'll always feel that way. Now, to trade just to trade, I don't think we've ever done that and I would never do that. I don't care what our record or depth is or any of that stuff. If there is a good football player we are going to take him, unless someone offers something that makes sense for us."

They also are in the process of adding a bakery and sandwich and retail shop that is due to open in the next month or so. Balla says they will then gently remodel the dining room and try to do something about the exorbitant noise level.
We'd suggest something entirely different: Ribose. It's actually a sugar, but a completely different kind. Ribose is made in your body, where it's used to build key energy molecules, but you also can get it as a supplement. The most convincing evidence for ribose's ability to infuse energy is that taking a daily dose gives a real boost to people with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome – diseases characterized by exhaustion. The only side effect is that some people feel too much energy.
There is a grave and gathering threat to the nation. It is not some shadowy foreign terrorist group or a runaway asteroid that threatens to destroy us. Unlike the plots of summer blockbusters, we are not menaced by evil wizards, mutants or rising armies of the undead. No, the threat we face is real, dangerous — and of our own doing. I am referring to the failure of our political leaders to raise the U.S. debt ceiling.

Not every Quentin Tarantino film has a swift, clean DVD release. “Jackie Brown” fans had to wait five years for that film’s DVD debut; “Grindhouse” was broken into two separate DVD releases.

I didn't have many answers to this question, so I asked local Republican Jeff Henry what he thought about the government wasting money. He said that the greatest waste of money is the money we pay in interest on our debt. The U.S. should have left the large corporations fail, the financial dust settle, and the large and stronger banks and corporations would have survived to pick up the pieces. The money the U. S. has created to bailout the problems have not bailed out anything. It has caused us greater debt and larger debt payments in interest (tax dollars).

The yield on three-year Treasuries is just 0.4%, which isn't going to cut it for many investors looking for income from their bond portfolios. Even investors willing to take on a 10-year Treasury are looking at annual yields at about 2.0%.

The Browns' backup QB has a few things going for him today. 1. He's more familiar with the present offensive system than he was with what they ran last year, so he should have no trouble stepping right in. 2.

Spoof. * * * R. The Reagan-era TV series that inspired this inspired comedy was serious about its laughable premise. A team of young-looking police officers went undercover as high-school students to investigate youth-related crimes. In the revival, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play high-school antagonists turned police- academy grads who find themselves thrown together in an identical back-to-school operation. Their captain (Nick Offerman of NBC's "Parks and Recreation") explains the program was revived because "the people who think these things up have no creativity or imagination. All they do now is recycle (stuff) from the past and expect us not to notice." (Colin Covert, Minneapolis Star Tribune) 109 minutes

I had no facility for math. Nonetheless, I'd stare fascinated at the Pierre Hotel and the Sherry-Netherland from the Sheep Meadow in Central Park, trying to decide whether the Sherry-Netherland's spire topped out above the Pierre's flat, copper-roofed summit.

As Piller reported, two kinds of tests were done on the foundation  the gamma-gamma logging done by Wiles and cross-hole sonic logging tests done by the contractor to further test structural integrity. Piller found that Wiles did not verify the accuracy of his equipment as required before testing. While Piller found Caltrans documents showing that most of the piles tested by Wiles' colleagues were given a second layer of testing by the contractor, he found similar documents for just one of those tested by Wiles.
Buck answered: "It was almost 20 years to the day and anybody who asks me about it and why I did it, I did it for my mom who was watching and hanging on every word and misses my dad like crazy.

He buys his blue jeans at the Salvation Army and rents a peeling tract home in Tarzana, which he shares with his wife and children, parents, brother, sister-in-law and three nieces and nephews. He shelled out his savings, took out a loan and borrowed from family members to open this shop.
Obama's health care proposals may be undesirable (they are), but it's mindless to oppose them -- as many Republicans do -- by screaming that they'll lead to "rationing." Almost everything in society is "rationed," either by price (if you can't afford it, you can't buy it) or explicit political decisions (school boards have budgets). Health care is an exception; it enjoys an open tab. The central political problem of the health care nation is to find effective and acceptable ways to limit medical spending.

Anyone who works in politics knows that candidates for federal office cannot accept donations above a legal limit; in 2008, the maximum contribution was $2,300 per election. Campaigns cannot accept free travel or other in-kind contributions over that limit. Edwards is an attorney who served as John Kerry's 2004 running mate. As a senator, he was a proud supporter of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance measure. The notion that he was unaware of campaign finance law is risible.

"I think Americans in general have a very profound level of concern for child welfare," Traube said. "And here you have 14 children whose mom is living on welfare, who has now declared bankruptcy, who is going in the media and posing topless and who most recently said she would be willing to do porn films if it meant that she could provide for her children.

There was no national tracking of malpractice or disciplinary actions by hospitals, licensing boards or professional societies.

The two patriotic songs that preceded the opening coin toss were both crisply rendered. Original American Idol Kelly Clarkson, possessor of one of the strongest voices in contemporary pop, performed a fine rendition of the national anthem. She did not draw out “The Star-Spangled Banner” to interminable length as many singers do, but she didn’t hurry through the song either. She sang, in short, like a fan with a football game to watch.
Women may also be responding to the reality that in many cases they will be bigger contributors to their family income than their mothers were.

But DeBois acknowledges viewing some elements of Amish life would pose a problem even for her. "It would take some doing to arrange for a tourist to attend church services, which are held in a different home every other Sunday from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m.," she said. "Baptisms, which take place around the age of 22, would pose a similar problem."
What's a hot dog without mustard?

Unlike granite cliffs, which tend to be steep and jagged, these have been eroded smooth.

The effort appears to be working. Audience tracking surveys show that "Act of Valor" is poised to enjoy a strong opening weekend, with a potentially winning three-day gross of $20 million or more, while some prognosticators say it could premiere with as much as $25 million. Given how well the film plays to audiences — and that it opens against the lightly regarded "Tyler Perry's Good Deeds," "Wanderlust" and "Gone" — it's likely that "Act of Valor" will fill auditoriums for weeks to come.
Then that magic day comes. You hire the babysitter and get a few minutes away from the hardest job in the world, retreating perhaps to a nearby restaurant. So what happens? You talk about kids. Their school. Their friends. Their hurts. Their hopes.

Q As a child, I had a Labrador, and he was the love of my life -- after he hit 2 years old, that is. Up until then, he destroyed our home and drove us nuts. My neighbor has a Lab that just had a litter of puppies, and my kids are begging for one. With the summer almost here, I find it hard to say no, because I'm a teacher and will have the time to train a puppy. However, I just can't go through what my mother had to with my childhood Lab. Could you offer any suggestions that would make my life easier before I tell everyone "yes" to the puppy?

At present, for every $25,000 the federal government spends on care for patients with Alzheimer's, it spends only $100 on research. Furthermore, the cost of care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease is likely to skyrocket over the next few years. With the changing demographics within our country, the number of Americans with Alzheimer's will increase from the current 5.3 million (including 230,000 people in Ohio) to an estimated 16 million by the year 2050. According to a recent report from the Alzheimer's Association, the total cost of care for individuals with the disease will soar from $172 billion in 2010 (including $5.7 billion in Ohio) to more than $1 trillion in 2050 -- which will likely bankrupt both Medicare and Medicaid if nothing is done.

Perhaps it's the anticipation as harvest ingredients appear in markets. Maybe it's the vibrant colors of nature that are reflected in seasonal desserts like golden pumpkin pie and scarlet cranberry crumble.

A very recent example is the Nov. 11 New York Times Op-Ed, "This Is Your Brain on Politics," written by seven research scientists, including three from FKF Applied Research (on its website, the company calls itself "The Leader in NeuroMarketing"). The article describes the functional MRI brain scans of swing voters who were shown political pictures while in the scanner. Based on which areas of the brain were activated by particular pictures, the authors offered conclusions such as "Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani are on opposite sides of the gender divide," "Mitt Romney shows potential," "Fred Thompson ... evokes more empathy (than Rudy Giuliani)" and "John Edwards has promise  and a problem." One presumes this is saleable information to political campaigns. In swift reaction, a Nov. 22 editorial in the scientific journal Nature harshly criticized this "questionable scientific research," calling it "a great disservice to science" and "a great deal for the company."

These "bioengineered" algae are placed into tanks, where they get fat on sugar beets, switch grass or a host of other plants. The sun's energy, which is stored in the plants, is transformed by the hungry algae into oil, which can be refined into jet fuel, bio-diesel, cooking oil or even cosmetics.
