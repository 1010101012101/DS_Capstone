ultimate irony on a day of NFL ironies that the worst defense in football played Tebow the best and was the catalyst for a 41-23 destruction of Denver. Finally, someone defended him the right way.

There's going to be a transition from college to the NFL no matter what. Coming to the 3-4 defense, there are even more things (Poe) will have to learn. It's not about taking off from the line of scrimmage on every play anymore. It's about being disciplined and playing within the defense. It's a challenge you take head on, and you have to understand it won't be accomplished in one day.

Last year, Forte considered not reporting to training camp on time, which would've subjected him to a daily fine. But this year, Forte is unsigned, with the Bears' one-year, $7.74 million franchise tender on the table. He could skip mandatory camps, if he so chooses, although he does have a hard-and-fast deadline to abide by. His power play is to deny the team one of its most important players from last season during this offseason, in training camp and perhaps into the regular season.

An hour before the first students arrived that morning, three dozen teachers gathered around Bennett in the school cafeteria and explained that after years of failure, they'd decided they had to find a better way. The testing program, they told him, is the centerpiece of that new way, as it addresses students' retention, stamina and critical-thinking deficiencies, which had been exposed annually by ISTEP. And, they said, the tests have added a spirit of healthy competition to the school because the top weekly scores -- by individual students and classes -- are prominently displayed on the school's walls each week.

The drug inhibits the growth of the abnormal, leaky blood vessels.

Salting prompts another debate, naturally. Some, like Somerville and Rodgers, believe in adding salt early to tease out flavors. Others, like Paul Canales of Oliveto in Oakland, don't salt stock at all, figuring that it's safer to season the dish the stock is used in. A salted stock, if reduced for a sauce, can become too salty, says Canales. But Rodgers says that her own side-by-side test convinced her that a stock seasoned early has "more chickeny-ness" than a stock salted after cooking.

Those measures have played pivotal roles in making our nation's waters swimmable and fishable, reducing the heartbreak of childhood asthma and premature death from pollution-related disease, and enhancing our state's "Pure Michigan" natural resource assets. This is why the Michigan Environmental Council, for which I now have the privilege of serving as president, honored Congressman Dingell with its Helen and William Milliken Award for Distinguished Service. Congressman Dingell has been the architect of many of our nation's environmental policies. He shepherded through Congress the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, legislation to buy millions of acres of land for the National Wildlife Refuge System, the Wilderness Act, and dozens of other major conservation bills.

Without it, they fear, the team will bolt for Los Angeles or another market.

PolitiFact has repeatedly checked statements in recent months about "maxing out the U.S. credit card," and found significant exaggeration. Although Democrats shoulder a fair amount of blame for the nation's fiscal woes, so do Republicans because they voted for tax cuts and additional spending that also contributed to the large deficits.
Graffiti is a vernacular art. The remoteness of City Hall and the anonymity of socioeconomic power are confronted by in-your-face tagging, whose anarchic purpose is to register individual identity. In its crudest form it blurts, "I exist!" Its more imaginative forms also shout, "And I'm fantastic!"

The number of licenses is limited by the county's population — there is supposed to be one license for every 2,500 residents. But the cap isn't calculated countywide. Instead, it is administered on the level of the county's 15 election districts, an arcane set of lines that have not changed in decades and don't necessarily reflect the way county communities are divided today. Election districts are used now for no purpose other than divvying up liquor licenses.

He turned to Oakland blacksmith Daniel Hopper to create something that would fit into the plant theme. Hopper, who tends toward organic, industrial designs, came up with the perfect form for a backyard barbecue: a carnivorous Venus flytrap. Using a cut-up Weber grill as a form around which to shape the sheet metal, Hopper designed two enormous flytrap-shaped barbecues and three companion metal pitcher plants for lights. Originally, one of the forged steel flytraps was meant for vegetarian fare and the other for meat, but McConnell says, "I think we lost track of which side is which."

You'll love to eat this way but don't get carried away, with prices running $6 to $14 a plate. After three visits, I recommend two of you order one or two shared or small plates, split a salad and then order pizza or pasta. You'll drop about $20 apiece (excluding tip) sampling some great flavors. If you add beverages, the Luxe brand wine is a solid value at $7 per glass. Skip the thinly flavored, non-alcoholic ginger beer ($3.50). It sounds good but fails to deliver the expected gingery punch.

The sauce in my wife's Chicken Carciofe pasta (chicken breast sauteed with butter, garlic, white wine and artichokes for $16.99) was a little bland, in need of more garlic or fresh herb flavor.

Some people say that the grand jury is a rubber stamp of what the prosecution wants.

Hogue announced last year that it was moving all of its production to screw-cap closures. The winery released a study indicating that wines aged with its layered polyethylene-lined screw caps were tastier than those with aluminum or tin-lined screw caps or synthetic closures. These caps also eliminate the risk of taint that can occur using traditional corks. As much as I enjoy the sound of a cork being pulled out of a wine bottle, Hogue makes a good argument for its screw caps. And I certainly prefer those over dense plastic closures that can be difficult to remove and are murder on corkscrews.

Update: Word comes that NBC will air reruns of "Whitney" in the "Free Agents" time slot. Which feels like adding insult to injury, since "Whitney" isn't funny, has a studio audience that apparently finds the stupidest lines screamingly hilarious, and had the benefit (if you can call it that) of a relentless promo campaign from the network. Boo.

A few years ago, Urlacher was fading and seemed headed for oblivion when he lost the superior and gifted skills that made him the NFL's defensive player of the year. But he has been rejuvenated since missing virtually the entire 2009 season with an injury. He's not just fresher, he's smarter. It turns out he wasn't just making plays with his unique skills in his prime, he was learning.

Along with the worries of late hail, mold and grape-eating birds is the amount of water grapes lose every day they hang on the vines. The grapes are turning into raisins, so the amount of free-run juice obtained from these late-late-harvest grapes is a small percentage of what would come from a normal, ripe Cabernet grape. It's concentrated, complex and naturally sweet, with a high, bright tartness to bring it all together.
The simple recipe for the julep is mint muddled with sugar, with bourbon and ice. With mint growing everywhere right now, it's wonderful to be able to collect a key ingredient for this cocktail growing wild.

His current condition was not immediately available.
The scene is, in one obvious respect, something of a didactic illustration of rape as an instrument of war, but it's also undeniably and rightly disturbing. It rattles the movie and you along with it, and it also introduces the idea that war is very much about the violent domination of women and not just about nation-states, ethnic conflicts, historical grudges and men killing men.
In the sequels-and-remakes department, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones team up again for "Men in Black 3" (May 25), and Jeremy Renner stars as a spy who isn't Jason Bourne in "The Bourne Legacy" (Aug. 3).

Anyway, that's not what you asked. As for that question, my answer is: I don't know. I think the outcome will be dictated largely by Greene's performance. If he finally manages to translate his great tools into great results – i.e. a .450 slugging average, strong defense, and superior baserunning – he will be too good to keep out of the lineup. But if he continues to struggle making contact and converting routine plays, then the club will turn to Descalso. I like both players and am looking forward to seeing how this all shakes out.
