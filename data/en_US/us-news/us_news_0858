The recipe on the bag calls for butter or margarine, milk (cow, soy or rice milk all work fine), lemon juice, eggs, water and vanilla. One-sixteenth of the unprepared mix (30 grams) has 110 calories, 0.5 grams of fat and 2 grams of fiber. We successfully made this cake substituting apple sauce for half the butter and separating the eggs so we could whip the whites to lighten the cake.

We did a lot of preparation heading into the series, but they’ve continued to score on us. I think in each game, we’ve taken two penalties that we could have avoided. We can’t put them on the power play two extra times than we get on the power play. We just can’t do that.”

Is their postage-stamp-sized apartment in New York, where no matter their achievement they never feel successful enough, George and Linda's idea of fulfillment? Is it the Atlanta McMansion of George's brother, Rick (Ken Marino), which resembles a showroom for products advertised in Skymall magazine?

For the red wines, experts suggest light- to medium-bodied fruity reds that are not too tannic. That means cabernet sauvignon is not a good match for the Thanksgiving meal. A better choice would be wines made from pinot noir grapes or reds from the French appellations of Côtes du Rhône and Beaujolais. Some people like to include a California zinfandel, which can be rich, spicy and mouthfilling. Be aware, though, that some zins have an alcohol level that's over 15 percent, which can be troublesome the next morning if you overindulge.

These small-but-comfy rooms are sold with no single-supplement surcharges, meaning solo travelers no longer have to choose between paying double the price and sharing with a stranger. The Studio Lounge sounds simple, but it's actually revolutionary. On most ships there is no other way to know who is single (they don't exactly issue badges). But I watched my fellow solo cruisers come together in our own lounge, which we soon started calling the living room, to play games and make plans to get together for meals and shows.

But it's Mr. Goldberg's final issue that seems most ominous for the music industry. He notes that the subscription model should be a good fit for kids, who consume lots of music in intensely social ways and are fickle in their tastes.

By missing out on a young audience, subscription services wind up battling with download sites over older consumers -- who consistently opt for downloads over streams.
The second volume of her journals, "As Consciousness Is Harnessed to Flesh," covers the period 1964 to 1980, when Sontag, ages 31 to 47, became the intellectual "It Girl" and later reigning diva of the New York literary world: a striking, accomplished, perceptive, radical and adventurous young writer. During this period, Sontag published eight books, made three films, survived stage IV cancer, traveled the world, became an antiwar activist, fell in and out of love, and lived her life - in New York, Paris and elsewhere - at a seemingly frantic pace.
OK, no we don't, and that's just the point. It's been clear for months, ever since Trutanich began compiling a campaign treasury that now exceeds $1 million, that his promise to focus on his job as city attorney and not seek higher office before completing two full terms was a bunch of bunk. He reneged on that commitment, and now his campaign spokesman is essentially making fun of anyone who was sucker enough to have thought he was serious and to try to hold him to his pledge.
In 2000, the attorney general said the county could only charge the $2 fee when "he makes a copy of a record in his custody by way of a photocopier or other device that photographically reproduces the original record." The county could not charge for citizens to find deeds online.

Chiang, meanwhile, asserts that he's only doing what voters asked when they approved Proposition 25.

The really crazy thing about this is that the nails that are so much smaller are actually called "Joist Hanger Nails" at the big box stores. They're called joist hanger nails because that's about the only thing they're good for... but they're usually not even good for that.

It all feels absolutely real, from the smell of wood smoke to encounters with Dementors, the Whomping Willow and, thanks to Hagrid, a fire-breathing dragon.

The distance from the soil surface to the rim of the pot can vary depending on the mature height of the variety being grown, but on average, leave about one to two inches between the rim of the pot and the soil surface to allow space for watering. The crown of the plant should be just below the soil line. When repotting becomes necessary, it's best if you lift the plant from the pot with root ball intact and add soil to the bottom of the pot, rather than burying the roots deeper by adding soil over the top. If the plant has become completely root bound, then either bump it up into to a larger pot or alternatively, plant them in your garden and buy a new, young hosta this spring to grow on for several years in the original pot.

Forty-yard dash times be damned, many scouts have Wright as a late first-round pick, falling to Cincinnati, Cleveland’s second pick, New England, Houston or Baltimore.

He has a vertical leap above 40 inches, he squats more than 500 pounds and was a two-sport star in college. If teams are looking for a crisp route-runner who can separate himself, Wright is the guy.

As a result, producers are forced to take on a greater role in advocating for original scripts. "Several years ago, you could walk into a studio with a one-liner and a writer who's written some scripts and sell it in the room if it was commercial enough," says Todd Lieberman, a producer on "The Fighter." "Now you have to prove that there is a movie there, and the best way to prove that is to have the writer write the script."

A At this stage of the vehicle's life, I don't think this is a significant problem. It doesn't affect dependability or utility. Having replaced the engine mounts, the only other item I would check would be the vacuum system for the power brake booster. A leak or low engine vacuum at idle due to age and mileage would certainly amplify the roughness. A cylinder balance test might identify a somewhat weak cylinder as a contributing factor. Regardless, I'd be very hesitant to spend any serious money on additional diagnostics or repairs.

Before the law went into effect, neither New Jersey nor out-of-state wineries could ship their bottles directly to customers here unless they did it through a wholesale distributor. The new law cuts out the middle man, allowing wineries to earn more profit per bottle by selling them directly to customers at retail prices.

Simon and Brian Eno work so well together here you’ll wonder why they never thought of collaborating before. Every lyrical detail is matched by a commensurate musical element — sometimes a synth texture, sometimes a treated backing vocal, sometimes something undefinable. This is Simon’s summary of life during wartime, and it’s suffused in unease. But if he doesn’t see a way out for himself, at least he’s got some cold advice for his daughter: “You don’t need to waste your time worrying about the marketplace/Trying to help the human race/Struggling to survive its darkest night.” He tucks this into a sentimental lyric with the skill of a housekeeper at a four-star hotel turning down a bed.

I'm thinking that was what Stephen Foster was thinking, too, when he wrote "Old Folks at Home" in 1851, which has been the official state song since 1935. Over the years, the song has inspired criticism for the insensitive and politically incorrect references to slavery and use of plantation dialect in its original lyrics. In 2008, the Legislature designated that a revised version of the lyrics be the official version.

There was a sommelier there who wanted to be kind so he gave us a bottle of Nuits-St-Georges Burgundy. It was a very good vintage as I recall.

The Kamakakuokalani Center for Hawaiian Studies at the University of Hawaii in Manoa is part of the Hawai'inuiakea School of Hawaiian Knowledge, founded in 2007.

Individuals might have a harder time setting up a visit to a charter school, but to witness Hawaiian pride among the younger generation, the Kamehameha Schools' annual Ho'olaule'a (Celebration) in February and Song Contest in March — both attended by thousands of island residents — are good places to start.

The more they can talk about how cute Palin is, the less they have to educate the public about how McCain's economic proposals would perpetuate the bad economy and how he intends to keep us in a very unpopular war.

Sutherland has a much larger body of work to cover than Walter Scott did with his 1825 "Lives of the Novelists," and trying to fit all of Sutherland's witticisms into a newspaper review would be as impossible as listing all 294 included authors.
