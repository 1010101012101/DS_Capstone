Cirucci, a resident of Whitman Square, is a natural talker, radiating positive and engaging energy. While she was in nursing school, Cirucci said she’d often get in trouble for spending extra time talking to the patients, not knowing she’d soon be in their place. With a personality that draws people in seemingly without effort, it makes sense she’d shine in the sound booth.

The mortgage boom and eventual bust so far has led to foreclosure proceedings against roughly 8 million Americans. About 11 million more own homes that are "underwater," meaning the amount of money owed now exceeds the value of the home.

As the final day dawns, the remaining three teams head for Honolulu and a cryptic clue about twins. Turns out, it's Mauku Makai, twin towers that face the mountains and the sea, and that offer one of the most challenging challenges of all time. Yeesh. They'll have to scale the outside of this 45-story building, look for their next destination from the top, and then rappel down -- facedown. If you weren't afraid of heights before this challenge, it pretty much guarantees you will be now. And holy moly, Team Big Bro's Sparkles is dressed entirely in green sequins. If you didn't suffer from sequinophobia before this episode, you will now.

I wish the state volleyball tournament used double elimination instead of pool play. There are two fundamental problems with pool play. First, matches 9-12 could be irrelevant, pairing two teams already eliminated or two teams already guaranteed to advance. Second, pool play always sets up the possibility of a three-way tie with only one or two teams advancing. What would you think about having volleyball use a double-elimination format instead of pool play?
The parents of Rusty Sneiderman, the Dunwoody entrepreneur murdered outside a daycare in 2010, have petitioned a Fulton County judge to grant them visitation rights with their two grandchildren.
During my time in Washington, the quantity of information has increased, but its quality has decreased. The explosion of advocacy organizations, interest groups and "think tanks" -- along with the growth of cable television and the Internet -- has bloated the supply of studies, factoids, sound bites and blog posts. The decline in quality reflects the polarization of political elites, of both left and right. More raw information flows through political or philosophical filters which screen out facts and arguments that do not fit the approved viewpoint or advance "the cause."
But adjusted net income was down 1 percent, at $3.77 billion, or 47 cents per share.

It never got any easier, he told me. Each child he couldn't save burned a scar on his heart. But, over the years, he'd learned that his job wasn't finished at the moment of loss — he had to remain stoic in his white coat and help the survivors come to grips with their loved one's death. Only after his work was truly done could the oncologist allow himself to be human and cry.

Let's get it out in the open. The kid is adorable, but trying to match the power of an Adele song is tough for anyone, mildly pubescent or not. The song was absolutely too big for Franckewicz's restricted range, but hey, no matter what I say, girls across the country are going to swoon, call him better (or worse) than Justin Bieber and vote for him. But through it all Franckewitz seems sweet and sincere enough — I hope he makes it through, despite the lackluster performance.

Anderson Cancer Center in Houston analyzed data from 619 women with ovarian cancer. They found high levels of platelets were more common in women with an advanced case and who had shorter survival. The study showed that tumors generate a protein called interleukin-6, which fosters the increase in platelets and contributes to tumor growth. Medications that blocked interleukin-6 reduced the platelet count.

At the American Music Awards, Jennifer Lopez gave perhaps the most buzzworthy performance, appearing on stage to deliver what seemed to be an emotional rendition of "Papi" in a dramatic caped leopard-print gown, then stopping shortly into the song, breaking into a wicked smile, and then most of her gown flew off, revealing a fringed, glitter-covered bodystocking as she kicked into "On the Floor."
Chaplin's studio opened in 1918, and most of his known films were mainly shot on the premises, including feature-length hit 1921 silent dramedy "The Kid" and the 1925 romantic comedy "The Gold Rush."

The small crowd applauds as the chief executive officer introduces her company's new billboard -- the one that proclaims the Bay Area "Open for Business" and that this company, at least, isn't going anywhere. In reality, much of the company is already gone. Two weeks after the earthquake, many of the headquarters functions that the company operated out of the Bay Area were transferred to facilities in Denver. Many of its Bay Area employees are back at work, thanks to telecommuting and low-cost loans for employees who move to Colorado, but fewer service employees -- janitors, maintenance workers, security guards -- are needed for the skeleton crew that remains.

Exercising in the a.m. makes you more likely to stick with your workout routine, according to various studies. But the prime time for fitness is also the worst time for your outdoor allergies. Generally, pollen counts peak in the morning between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., says Frederick M. Schaffer, MD, chief medical officer of United Allergy Services.

"Trees don't like to pollinate when it's very warm out," says Paul Ehrlich, MD, a fellow of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. "During the day pollen is less of a problem-but in the mornings and evenings when it's cool and there's a breeze, the pollen just goes crazy."

They're so wrapped up that when Mike comes out as gay, nobody pays much attention — and when he tells us he's no good at happy endings, it's clear that's not the case.

His oft-monotone answers to the media’s daily questions make that hard to fathom, but Girardi explains it this way: "I’m pretty generic when I answer questions because I don’t ever want a player to think I’m sending a message through the media. I don’t ever want to do that. If I send a message I want it to be face to face. I don’t want them to ever read anything that can be misconstrued. I’m very careful what I say. It might come off as boring. But my concern is how the 25 guys in the room take it. So I’m careful."

Shopping South Lake Avenue is like surfing: Someone is going to tell you how much better it was before you came. And life was certainly good in the '90s, when retailers thrived and the Huntington hotel and Ritz-Carlton were linked. But now is not bad. The former Ritz, now the Langham Huntington Pasadena (1401 S. Oak Knoll Ave.), stands on 23 genteel acres and specializes in spa indulgences and twinkling holiday decorations. Its fancy restaurant, reborn as Royce in late 2010, has gotten strong reviews, and overnight rates sometimes drop below $200. Your shopping starts with the old Bullock's building (401 S. Lake Ave.), a 1947 Streamline Moderne landmark that now holds Macy's. The neighbors include Orvis (345 S. Lake Ave., No. 102) for fly-fishers, Anthropologie (340 S. Lake Ave.) for teens and Ten Thousand Villages (567 S. Lake Ave.) for buyers of fair-trade art and crafts. Leave time for zucchini bread at Green Street Restaurant (146 S. Shopper's Lane) or the nouveau cafeteria cuisine of Lemonade (146 S. Lake Ave.). Then walk off the calories amid the fountains and arches of the Caltech campus (1200 E. California Blvd.; Olive Walk tour searchable at http://www.caltech.edu), where the Richter scale was born. To fit in, tell people you still miss the synchrotron, a machine for accelerating electrons. It was dismantled in 1970.)

A word about the nutty religions. They don't cut anything like as much ice as you might think from reading about them. They are here, and practically everybody polices his discourse with "pass on," instead of "die:" he can't be quite sure what cult you may belong to. Even so, they are more like pastimes than the religions you are probably accustomed to. People find in them a relief from boredom, give them the zealous attention that a fad might command elsewhere; but they change off pretty easily from one to the other, and apparently don't care about them very deeply.

Considering wearing that froufrou fascinator on your wedding day just because it’s so royally de rigueur? A look dominated by diamonds, feathers, glitzy hairpins and mega-watt belts can seriously detract from the beauty of an intricate gown — not to mention the vision of the couple as a whole.

"Even in practice, when you feel like you have an empty net, he's always striving to stop that puck. It's just what he loves to do. I love it when you come out and score on a goalie in practice and he says something derogatory to you. It means he wants to stop everything. That's a great attitude, and he certainly has that."

Gray, the author of two previous, willfully odd short-story collections, is interested in the horror genre, but it's more akin to the alternately seething and absurd moods of David Lynch and Cronenberg than the plot machinations of Stephen King. In one scene, David thinks that Detective Chico, who questions him to make sense of Franny's death, has a nest inside his mouth, quivering with pills instead of eggs. Another character, David imagines, is harboring an inner ear between her lips.

Of course, kids grow up and move out, businesses change hands, time marches on. In the '80s, West Portal became a sort of forgotten, forlorn little enclave -- Woolworth's closed, hair salons specialized in blue rinses. But then in the '90s, like Rocky Balboa, the neighborhood got a second wind. People who had seen the strip as hopelessly frumpy and painfully old-fashioned suddenly rediscovered it as charmingly frumpy and delightfully old-fashioned. Families with young children moved back to troll the candy counter at Shaw's (though it now was serving Mitchell's ice cream), the movie theater went arty, bookshops and cafes brought in a new generation of hipsters, and the Manor Coffee Shop, steady as she goes, was suddenly cool again.
