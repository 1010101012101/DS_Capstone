Start by going down several cement steps to the picnic area, then head south. A sign on shore notes that the trail (also known as No. 511) is OK for mountain bikes, but with its sharp turns, trail scree and steep slopes along the water's edge well, it might be entertaining to watch others ride the trail, but I certainly wouldn't want to try it.

At Carver, for example, salaries for four principals, two assistants and an academic coach totaled $746,207 last year — $526 per student. The state’s largest school, Mill Creek High in Gwinnett County, spent $210 per student on the salaries of nine administrators. Schools in DeKalb and Clayton counties with enrollments comparable to Carver’s spent $223 to $291 per student.
4. How will the Lakers control their tempo? Brown has provided mixed assessments about how well the Lakers have maintained a balance between playing at a fast pace while making sure they're not getting into track meets. Golden State's up-and-down style of play could propel the Lakers into bad habits, but there's an easy solution. The Lakers simply need to play methodically and slowly but surely wear out Golden State's defense.

Murder plots, conspiracy and global meltdown are a lot to handle — but if you've ever read Simmons before, you know that he's adept at constructing immense, complicated frameworks, and "Flashback" is no exception. The big picture Simmons envisions, and that Bottom faces, partly involves a looming war with a resurgent Islam and the lulling of the United States to sleep with flashback. Who's behind this treachery is a shocker — and won't be revealed here.
Taking advantage of an interlude of sunny winter weather, my friend Kai Wiedman and I loaded up our backpacks and drove to the Bear Valley Visitor Center in the Marin County hamlet of Olema. It was midweek, so we were able to stroll right in and score a permit for a three-day loop of about 20 miles connecting two of the park's most scenic campsites, Coast Camp and Wildcat Camp. (Weekends tend to be reserved several weeks in advance, even in winter. See "If you go.")

øWith the 5D Mark II, videographers learned that a still camera - thanks to its massive sensor - could provide a better looking image than many video cameras. The sensor is about 20 times the size of most camcorders. The 5D - and its dreamy, out of focus backgrounds -was used for the opening credits of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Saturday Night Live, and an entire episode of Fox's House. The current movie, Act of Valor, which opened last week, was shot on the 5D Mark II.

"We have a phantom pain," he said, like the pain of an amputated limb, and his words enlarged my vision of what the old country has become: a place of hope.

"Alternative Energy" unfolds in 28 minutes and four movements, each evoking a different time and place. (The movements are: "Ford's Farm, 1896," "Chicago, 2012," "Xinjiang Province, 2112" and "Reykjavik, 2222," which by that time is a rain forest.) Different forms of energy and modernity intervene in each of these communities. Whatever message may have been intended, however, became less important than the sonic spectacle and rhythmic gamesmanship of the piece. It's basically a young man's John Adams, of the "Gnarly Buttons" and "Naïve and Sentimental Music" variety. There's a lot of percussion, including a crank mounted on a Ford radiator. The electronic sounds – buzzers, high-pitched clicks, thuds, the Millennium Falcon taking off – engage in a lively interplay with the orchestra, and mesh with and support it too. More surprising, perhaps, one could dance, if so inclined, to most of "Alternative Energy."

Humm pairs chilled cantaloupe soup with lobster ice cream to kick off the Campton Place tasting menu, and he finishes with a quark souffle with apricots, black pepper and thin strips of candied prosciutto slicing the top of a scoop of whole milk ice cream. At the French Laundry, white chocolate granite highlights a sweet nicoise olive nougatine. Both Manresa and Masa's serve corn ice cream or sorbet, and basil also shows up in frozen confections at Fleur de Lys and Masa's.

— Michael Gambon as Dumbledore: Gambon took over the role after the death of Richard Harris, who played the headmaster at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the first two films in the franchise, "Sorcerer's Stone" and "Chamber of Secrets." And he took a different approach to the part: While he remained a bastion of all that is good and true in the world, a steady and authoritative voice of reason, Gambon played him with a bit more fire and range than Harris. Perhaps that's also because more of the character is revealed to us over time. With his long, silver hair and beard, Dumbledore is revered, but he's also got some secrets.

Monday's numbers are in line with Madrid's assumption that the country's economy will contract 1.7% this year. But it is unclear how the continued spending cuts by Spain's central and regional government will be compounded, as the unemployment rate is expected to rise above the current 22.8% of the workforce. Increasing unemployment paired with reduced tax receipts would make it increasingly difficult for Madrid to hit its deficit targets.
Frank Murray's Turf Irish Pub, run by the team behind Seamus McCaffrey's, is an easy place to kick back with imperial pints (20 ounces) of Guinness, Harp, Smithwick's and Boddingtons. Make no mistake. According to Republic restaurant critic Howard Seftel, this isn't destination-restaurant fare. But when you're seated at the handsome 42-foot-long wooden bar or in a comfy oversize booth in the company of agreeable people and a beverage, he says it's hard to be picky about the food. The Turf serves salads, wraps and burgers, but the Irish dishes steal the show. According to Seftel, of the four versions of hearty boxty, a griddled potato cake, the one with chicken in cream sauce and the one with corned beef and cabbage both are solid choices. The corned beef is good, not too fatty or salty, and the big chunks of cabbage are cooked just right.

Gladys says she doesn't mind Len's "constructive criticism" because that's how she learns. Gladys says that 1957 was her most memorable year, when she toured and met Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson and James Brown. She was only 13! Whoa - did we know Tristan had all this ink on her arms? I never noticed it before and it's quite a large piece. They're dancing a foxtrot to "Cupid," as made famous by Sam Cooke. This song is so swoon-worthy and it's a great fit for Gladys. Tristan has apparently borrowed your great-grandfather's golf shoes for this dance. Gladys smile lights up the stage, but this is more "your sweet grandmother dancing at a wedding" than some of the more professional looking dances/dancers we've already seen this season from other stars. Len points out that he and Gladys are the same age, and admires Gladys for her hard work and dedication and says her frame is improving. And then he asks if he can be a Pip! The camera catches Tristan looking straight into the camera and winking. I'm not going to lie to you: That was totally meant for me.

Sanderson walks her group of 12 students through a flight of three soups, from the gentle roasted chicken and mushroom to the bright and intense vegetable bean to a sultry fish chowder. Each soup is much more delicate than you expect and served with salad and a flourish. The class also prepares two breads and an outrageously light chocolate fudge cookie (it’s Sanderson’s philosophy that every class should end in chocolate.) Afterward, she ladles out containers of leftovers: “Every soup we’re making today will taste better tomorrow.”

But for now, panelists say Dyer, 53, is the guy who gets most of what he wants through sheer grit. He's gotten everything from SunRail to an arts center.

The prosecutors office was very fair in how they dealt with this case, Lavigne said. They took an even-handed approach and treated (it) with an appropriate amount of seriousness but also recognized the context of the case. And Id like to think that they also recognized a lot of the positive steps that Mr. Leshoure has made in terms of acknowledging responsibility, being accountable and trying to do the best that he can to move forward for the future, as opposed to dwelling on the past.

One potential compromise envisions a cap only until the DNR articulates a new strategy for acquisition and management of its holdings, but even that has some risk. Meanwhile, in another bill, lawmakers appear to be trashing existing DNR policy to consolidate state land. Until they can articulate what they really want, and justify it statewide, the bill to cap the DNR's holdings should stay in committee.

Romney won Ohio's primary narrowly, by 10,508 votes in the unofficial count, but he captured more delegates in the state and nationally than any competitor, giving him an edge well before the Republican convention in August. Others in the Republican presidential race say it is presumptuous to assume the former Massachusetts governor will be their party's nominee. Still, he was the Ohio victor, and in winning, he provided a glimpse of challenges he'd face in an election against Obama:
The Bulls talked like a team that believed in itself but stopped playing like one after 12 minutes. They started played like a team waiting for Rose to save the day as he has so often in the past - a bad habit that suddenly makes the present more daunting.
NCTD's actions and results are significant given that most private and public entities have struggled over the last three years during the unprecedented downturn in the nation's economy. At a time when more than 80% of transit agencies nationwide have either increased fares or cut service to meet budget demands, NCTD has done the exact opposite, decreasing fares and increasing service. NCTD has provided significant system and financial improvements to both our riders and to San Diego taxpayers. While the transition has not been without its challenges, residents in North County now have a more efficient, fiscally stable transportation system.
By formally opening his campaign in Ohio and Virginia, Obama is underscoring the critical role both states will play in his efforts to keep his job.

Like the House bill, the Senate measure would establish a long-term care insurance program, modeled off a bill proposed by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. Enrollment in the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) program would be automatic unless you opted out, with no health screening required. It would not pay as much as many private plans; the Senate bill envisions a $75 daily benefit. That's enough to offset some costs for people who are able to stay in their own homes with limited help, but not enough to pay a full nursing home bill.

Before the first practice, McMillan had to scrap one of the biggest wrinkles he had planned: playing Nicolas Batum at shooting guard. With Aldridge unable to practice, Wallace moved over to power forward and Batum to small forward. After Aldridge returned shortly before the season, there were too few practices to implement Batum at shooting guard. As a result, Batum spent much of the first month lost in a haze of self-doubt and McMillan's stubbornness in curtailing his minutes.
Smelting wouldn't be great on this night, not like the old days when bunches of seiners gathered along the beach leading to Duluth's Park Point, and also at the mouth of the Lester and other rivers up the North Shore.

Prayer might help us foster deeper connections in a place full of disconnected people.

In 2002, Alvin Payne, acting director of parks and forestry, stated in a letter: “I would like to request that the planning board and the institute re-evaluate this proposal to develop this land.

Its dishes showcase a typical multiplicity of chile types and styles: dried to an almost black-red or sun-bleached; whole or crushed into flakes; ground to an incendiary powder; fresh and zingy with spurts of chile juice; soft and almost sweet, yet blazing; and, of course, pickled whole or in slices.
Too sweet or too fruity. Many people mistake fruitiness for sweetness, which is not the same. Or they confuse floral notes, such as those found in Viognier, as fruity. There are plenty of dry white wines on the market that have high acidity and low residual sugar. A dry Riesling may have lots of fruit in the mouth, but can be bone-dry, even more than many Chardonnays.
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.: This is a tragedy for the Senate and the loss is particularly felt by all of us who have been privileged to serve with Dick on the Foreign Relations Committee. Its a blow to the institution during a period when the institution itself has been strained. Whether he was serving as chairman or ranking member of our committee, wielding the gavel or working the floor, Dicks approach to governing was always the same: he wanted to find serious answers to some of foreign policy's most vexing questions. Hes a class act and a gentleman and in a Senate that has seen so much change and transition these last years, his expertise on complicated issues honed over 36 years simply can't be replicated. I know, however, that Dick Lugar will finish out his sixth term in the Senate with the same determination and effectiveness that has marked every year of his service here, and he will have many more contributions still to an institution he reveres and that reveres him.

Rob Nichols, a spokesman for Kasich, also minimized the governor-elect's role.
Speaking of consistency, the Mountain Lion edition of Mail will no longer include the Notes feature and Reminders will more naturally belong to the Reminders app instead of iCal. It's a bit of long-overdue housecleaning. In Lion, both of these features stuck out like the burnt-orange fixtures in the one bathroom that still hasn't been remodeled in the forty years since your house was built. They didn't really belong where they were, and they harkened to a simpler, cheaper time. Now, both of these functions are in places where the user might actually sensibly go looking for them.

No Cappelli brand is imminent, he says, though aging in his cellar are about 50 barrels of angelica made from mission grapes he's bought from assorted old-vine vineyards in neighboring Amador County. Maybe in two or three years, he'll start selling that. (Angelica is a California original, dating from the mission days. It's a wine whose fermentation is stopped with the addition of aguardiente, an early distilled spirit. After long aging in barrel, the result is a sweet, thick, warm and nutty dessert wine.)
Where did this fail? I submit that the largest failure is at the top with the City Manager. He is the one that was responsible to ensure that polices & procedures were changed! He is the one that allows part time and full time city employees along with other outside Police Departments and Sheriff Office employees to have the entry code to the police department! He is the one that narrowed the Chiefs applicants to three and then selected an applicant with 28 years of experience from nine agencies over two retired Captains each having25 years with one agency. Each supervising over 150 employees and managing a budget 7 times that of the Fruitland Park Police Department.

She has been a staunch proponent of the need for patient-reported outcomes in cancer clinical trials. For years, symptoms and side effects have been reported by doctors. While doctors can report accurately and directly on results that show up in lab reports or imaging, that doesn’t tell the whole story.
4. Not the same as "I owe you one." Feeling indebted isn't necessarily the same as the heart-on-your-sleeve connection you get with pure, open gratitude. In fact, married couples don't get a boost in satisfaction and closeness when one partner feels indebted to the other. It takes emotional honesty and a little bit of vulnerability to make that spot inside you melt.

Even amid chaos there are rules to the game, and the rules that Reza advances are a lot like the rules of farce, which are also the rules of good television situation comedy. Each contestant carries an easily identifiable stamp, which in this case is typed, casually and almost lazily, by job description. Alan is a lawyer (think shark). Veronica is an art lover and writer of books and articles about tragedies in Africa (think overprivileged meddler). Michael operates a wholesale company, handling household goods (think uncultured business guy). Annette is a wealth manager (think what you will). These are caricatures, but as Arndt’s fine cast reveals, they are caricatures with more than a pound to flesh out. All four neatly pull off that most difficult of actorly challenges: They make you like their characters even as you actively detest them.
"It's called natural gas at four dollars" (per thousand cubic feet), said Tom Stewart, executive vice president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, referring to the low wholesale prices for gas. "There is so much natural gas being produced from shale, particularly the Marcellus in our end of the country, that in my view it's oversupplying the market. For conventional producers, that depresses the desire to go out and invest because their costs have not gone down, but the commodity prices have."

"There are going to be teams that have some interest in that pick," Fisher said. "What we do will define the future of this franchise moving forward. If we stay there who do we take, if we move down who do we take. What if we move down and come back up. That's going to define the future.

When John Noguez, the former mayor of Huntington Park and a rising star in Democratic political circles, ran for Los Angeles County assessor in 2010, we pointed out the dangers of choosing a politician for the job, as opposed to a more managerial type. "Voters must try to pick someone who is relatively free from politics, because they don't want valuation decisions being made as rewards or punishments for political support," we wrote. That's why we endorsed John Y. Wong, chairman of the Assessment Appeals Board, a successful businessman and expert on real estate valuation.

Happily, the frisky Shadyac does not sermonize. He is a puckish Sherpa to the frontiers of science and faith. (If his own Sherpas are political and religious progressives, then he would probably agree with Chesterton that "The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of the Conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected.") He asks questions that tickle viewers to consider his subject from different angles.
In his memo to local U.S. attorneys, Cole said the October 2009 policy was intended to spare seriously ill patients and their caregivers from prosecution.

Once those systems were in place, Ginger said, his role was to make sure law-enforcement administrators knew how they were being judged.
The side dishes were no better: I actually found a core in the cabbage salad (hey, where's my prize?), and the salad had none of the promised mango or chile flavoring. Refried beans had about as much flavor as wallpaper paste. The rice, laced with what tasted like tomato sauce, was fine, but the smoky pinto beans were the only thing worth filling up on.
In the first game of a series against Seattle, Max Scherzer gave up five runs in five innings in which he never got into a groove. Scherzer had yet to pitch dominantly this season, and in two of his four starts, he had given up many runs in the opening part of the game.

Why do so many people have such an undying fondness for the gaslit world of Holmes and Watson? Dirda offers many reasons: One is that Conan Doyle's writing possesses a quality he calls "compulsive readability." Conan Doyle was certainly artistic, but, as Dirda explains, he was less interested in aesthetic perfection than in reaching readers. That imperative guided his writing and is perhaps what resulted in a style that has withstood the passing of time. When you enter a Conan Doyle novel or story, as you would a house, there's a warm glow from a blazing hearth and a comfortable chair waiting for you. It's not a museum.
"It essentially makes the missing poster portable," said Stephen Watkins, a Toronto man who works with Child Quest and modified QR codes that were first developed by Toyota to track car parts.
We'd suggest something entirely different: Ribose. It's actually a sugar, but a completely different kind. Ribose is made in your body, where it's used to build key energy molecules, but you also can get it as a supplement. The most convincing evidence for ribose's ability to infuse energy is that taking a daily dose gives a real boost to people with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome - diseases characterized by exhaustion. The only side effect is that some people feel too much energy.

"At the Smithfield mass-confinement hog farms I toured in North Carolina," he wrote by way of explanation, "the visitor is greeted by a bedlam of squealing, chain rattling, and horrible roaring. To maximize the use of space and minimize the need for care, the creatures are encased row after row, 400- to 500-pound mammals trapped without relief inside iron crates 7 feet long and 22 inches wide. They chew maniacally on bars and chains, as foraging animals will do when denied straw, or engage in stereotypical nest-building with the straw that isn't there, or else just lie there like broken beings. ... All of these creatures, and billions more across the earth, go to their deaths knowing nothing of life, and nothing of man, except the foul, tortured existence of the factory farm, having never even been outdoors."

It will remain in quarantine for at least three months as veterinarians test it to make sure the animal, which had been housed with non-native turtles, hasn't contracted a disease that could harm native populations.

Moody's Investors Services said if oil stays above $100 per barrel, it will further weaken the global economic recovery. The price of oil, coal and natural gas could rise as Japan rebuilds and increases imports to make up for power generation lost from damaged nuclear reactors. Most of Japan's power -- about 28 percent -- comes from coal-fired plants. More than 50 nuclear reactors provide roughly 27 percent of the country's power.
"Oquendo and I have had this talk before about how I should use a bigger glove because I'm a taller guy," Greene explained this past spring. "I don't have to get as low. I'm not exaggerating because I've got a little glove. He said, 'A bigger glove for a bigger person.' It's the 11 ¾ inches (now). I've always used 11 ¼, so got the 11 ¾ last year and was messing with it. I really like it now. The way it's broken in it almost feel like a 11 ½ It doesn't feel like a 11 ¾. It's kind of like that perfect medium. It's a bigger glove, but it feels on my hand – it doesn't feel big."
Having lost two seats in the elections, Booker then antagonized a once-staunch council ally in Mildred Crump when he backed Donald Payne for council president.

Dominion Resources owns the other 60 percent and manages power plant.

We finally ran out of hours and turned back at Palmyra. For our last night, we tied up on the wall just below Lock 29, a peaceful, grassy spot with fields stretching north. Chuck grilled steaks and we ate them as a last cabin cruiser locked through eastbound and the lock tender signed off for the night. The sun was gone, and the yellow streaks on the slick pool below the lock turned orange, red and finally silver gray.

It must be said: One of the best things about a bar session at Comida Cantina is the food. A small list of "antojitos," or street snacks, offers small munchables like queso fundido and homemade chips and salsa. If the appetite is stronger, there's a wealth of clever tacos, quesadillas, tostadas and more. A bartender will be only too happy to keep it coming, preserving the sacred union of festive food and serious drinking.

"It was a new sign of hope, but unfortunately, only a brief one," Boehner said.
Not anytime soon, judging by its first-quarter profit of $473 million, more than four times last year's number.
Second, Americans practice limited government. Our system cleverly distributes power to the plurality (federal, state and local governments, citizens, nonprofit organizations, companies) and protects the power sharing with safeguards like individual liberties, free elections and independent courts. I hope that the torrent of anonymous election money enabled by the Supreme Court's recent ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission doesn't undermine this arrangement, bringing us closer to Malawi, and much of sub-Saharan Africa, where power is concentrated in the government and its paymasters. It's the tea party's worst nightmare, where well-connected hucksters pillage the public purse and trust, sometimes under the banner of "democracy." Former U.N.

From all this, you might not guess that government spending is higher in France (56 percent of gross domestic product) than in any of the other countries in the eurozone, or that its public debt, already 90 percent of GDP, is swelling.

With that field now effectively vanquished, Romney has seven months to persuade Americans that his core message — at least on the economy, which is what voters care most about — is one on which he has been consistent and that represents a sharp and positive contrast with Barack Obama.

We fully support, in fact champion, the affordable housing planning work done so well by the Pennytown Task Force, as well as the outlines of other sites prepared in the event of updated COAH guidelines. We in no way want to deprive neighbors and existing businesses of the ability to achieve sewer service as outlined in the Master Plan. However, the unattributed excess capacity, with no discernable checks to keep out sprawl and overzealous development in our communities, is of huge concern. The current ordinance in no way guards against this very real possibility.
The Cardinals currently project a record payroll of about $113.6 million for their opening day 25-man roster. The number includes the major-league contract awarded third-base prospect Zack Cox when he signed as the team's No. 1 draft pick in 2010.

Apprehension is particularly acute in Essex County, where Newark — which suspended operations at three fire companies following the considerable number of firefighter retirements late last year — and Orange have both lost firefighting personnel, all as a consequence of tightened budgets.

We raised four great kids, although they never wore designer clothes, nor did they have every toy known to man. They had food on the table and a roof over their heads. We have a small fixed pension and Social Security. In the meantime, costs keep rising. I'm sure you would be up a creek if you never got a raise.
The Hall, like so much in baseball, makes for great discussion. Too bad it too often devolves into attacks on the voters instead of an insightful look at the process and -- most importantly -- the candidates.
Chesapeake has been front and center in the U.S. natural gas boom. The recent plunge in natural gas has forced it to shift more of its production toward oil.

Near the Anthony home, at the swampy, mosquito-filled site where Caylee's remains were found, several people visited a makeshift memorial to the child Thursday.
