One featured chef, Nancy Silverton of Los Angeles, has been working with farmers and artisans for decades. She is known for her creative combinations and simple yet sophisticated cooking philosophy. Having been the original pastry chef at Spago, and now the owner/chef of Osteria Mozza, Silverton is always searching for the best quality she can find. She is big on cheese — she's renowned for her pizzas and eclectic cheese bar — so it is no wonder she came up with an interesting way to use burrata. Burrata is a fresh cheese invented as a way to use leftover curds after making mozzarella. The mozzarella is formed into a pouch and filled with these creamy curds.

Meanwhile, Snooki, JWoww and Ronnie are at a bar when they start getting heckled by a couple of women. When one of the women, referring to Snooki, asks JWoww, "Who's your fat friend?," JWoww tosses her drink at the woman. The woman responds in kind, and JWoww goes after her. One of the women grabs hold of JWoww's hair (or, as we suspect, "hair"), while JWoww gets in some decent punches on the other woman as bouncers try to wrestle them apart.

Editor - My favorite Pride Parade moment changed my life. It's when I first saw the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence in all their glory (in spite of hangovers, which inevitably occur after Pink Saturday). It was love at first sight, and I became a true fan while getting to know some of them and learning that what they do is help others - to a great extent, I might add. Their purpose is to raise money for people or groups in need that fall through the cracks of ordinary charities. They earn and donate thousands of dollars annually by working extremely hard and entertaining everyone like no one else can. They are wonderful to watch and delightful to have for friends and so funny! It's my great pleasure to volunteer for them when they need me.

Wrangling over the larger measure consumed about four months. The jobless benefits portion picked up enough GOP support in the Senate -- Maine moderates Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe -- only after it was broken off as a stand-alone bill.

There aren't many people who fit that bill. I think we are lucky with who we got."

So what will our eldest's first day of kindergarten be like? Will he overcome his shyness and enter school with his head held high, as he did the last couple of years in preschool or will we back to stage one with the yelling, crying and screaming?

When the harvester is finished with a row, most of the stems remain attached to the vine, the berries literally shaken off them. At the end of harvest, the fruit bins are filled with a mix of whole berries, crushed fruit and juice along with only a few stems. What the process lacks in romance it makes up for in economic sense. It costs $150 an acre to machine harvest grapes, according to Clos Du Val calculations. Harvesting by hand costs $600 or more an acre.

On the first day of winter, I ran my first half marathon in 1 hour, 41 minutes, 37 seconds and was neither tired nor sore.

Mitch McConnell, the Republican from Kentucky who is the Senate's minority leader, responded tartly on the Senate floor Wednesday. "Let’s be honest," McConnell said.

"Guys were saying the right things, trying to do the right things," Sharks coach Todd McLellan said. "Between periods, we were talking about it, that a lot of us have been here before. I thought there was a calmness with our team. Even when they had a real good push in the first overtime, for about 10 minutes, there was still a calmness on the bench. For me, that's a sign of veteran leadership, of experience, so it did show up, I believe."

Though he didn't say so publicly, within days of the Kingman escapes on July 30, 2010, Ryan ordered a security review of every state facility: the two run by Utah-based Management & Training Corp., including Kingman; the three run by Florida-based Geo Group; and the 10 operated directly by his department.

Chris Snee was aware of his quarterback’s shiftiness in the pocket last week against the Dallas Cowboys. It was the kind of footwork that makes Eli Manning so effective, he said. It wasn’t enough to call him an athlete, though.
FitzGerald replied: "I'm only here to answer questions related to this trial."
It's hard for me to talk about this, harder still to write about it, because I want everyone to know only what I loved about my dad. It feels disloyal to acknowledge this part of him and shameful to admit that this is part of my legacy.
And, of course, he is the club’s best player. In a dismal 8-1 defeat to Houston on Wednesday, Wright provided the only moments of brightness for his club. He walked, stole a base and scored the team’s only run. Later, he tripled. In all, his on-base plus slugging percentage jumped to 1.077. If Matt Kemp weren’t laying waste to the entire National League, Wright would be in the conversation for early-season MVP.
"This is an exciting opportunity for us to create a new, dynamic atmosphere for our schools, our student-athletes and our fans," Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said.

What steps can I take to get a refund? - Ted Van Anne,
"It's prohibitively expensive," he says. "The only people who could do that is a big-box store, and that's what the neighbors object to. The neighbors favor open space or a park, but the city is not going to pay what Mike Hashem wants for the land."
For a while there, I thought Hollie Cavanagh could win this thing. And not because she was the best. Or even second best. But watching "American Idol" and seeing her dig in her heels after finding herself in the bottom three week after week to turn around and hit us with performances as strong and self-assured as "River Deep -- Mountain High," I started wanting her to win. Because that would have been the best Hollywood ending that "Idol" could hope to deliver -- the inspirational uphill run of the little Texan that could.
"I'm now afraid of my government," she testified this morning. "...I feel like the whole protest has been derailed."
Even though Durant missed the first shot of the game, Serge Ibaka turned that into a putback basket. Durant then scored nine points in an early three-minute span, including two three-pointers and a 17-foot fadeaway, as Oklahoma City took a 14-7 lead.

Just before a video interview begins and Cain starts explaining why she no longer writes in such a big, bright room, she jumps up and puts a skeleton behind herself. Its name is Budget Bart (because it was the cheapest model on the website) and was a gift from her husband. It serves as a silent witness while the Boston terriers, Lucy ("the good one") and Rosie ("bad"), are more active listeners.
The UAW's 48,500 members who work for GM nationwide still must ratify the four-year contract that commits the automaker to this expansion.

When Morrow comes out of the locker room after the game, the first thing you see are the cuts. He looks like he's been in a knife fight in a closet, and he has a giant red rash-gash on the right side of his neck. Also, he doesn't have shoulders. Just that giant neck, which appears to come straight out of his legs in one sweeping geometric line. Also, his hair is so long and stringy that if you handed him a guitar I have no doubt that he'd rip off a few hard-core chords, then break the axe over his knee.

The number of homes damaged was still unknown, it said. Initially, the fire department had said 30 to 50 homes were destroyed. NHK TV reported that some 200 homes were damaged.
You may be right about Penn, but I think that giving him at least a year to learn what college life and college football is all about is a wise decision. Ramirez will be a nice solid QB in what will be a bit of a transition year. Once Burton can fill up the pipeline with his players, the VIKs will be a contender every season.

Now, Belichick is 3-2. Coughlin, whose job often seems to be in peril every time his Giants hit a slump amid the New York media market, is tied for fourth with two Super Bowl victories.
Dear David Fink: Not for me. I think Dieudonné is the weak link in "Napoleon." He does an awful lot of posing, and he has the added historical misfortune of looking like Marty Feldman in "Young Frankenstein." One of my readers said Rod Stewart, and I can see that, too, but I think Rod Stewart has more irony and self-awareness. Perhaps the best way of putting it is that Dieudonné looks like Marty Feldman singing "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?" Zaniness plus confidence.
The fascination with all things mobile is easily linked to traveling circuses, retro films such as "The Long, Long Trailer" starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the neighborhood ice cream truck decked with stickers for tasty sweet treats from drumsticks to Cool-a-Coo's, and the proverbial cross-country family road trip through the Grand Canyon aboard the tricked-out Winnebago or Volkswagen van.
But full casting isn't the new production's only twist. In director Leila Vatan's staging of "Twilight," a simulation of the riot involves actors tossing furniture, bouncing off walls in anger and hauling off a TV set while glowering menacingly at the audience. At one point, a white actor playing a police officer kicks a black rioter in the head. Break-dancing and other kinetic choreography are used to represent riot-related actions that Smith's work evoked but didn't explicitly represent.

øWhile Harper carries greater risk, he could bring fantasy owners greater reward. Getting the call to the majors so early will give him a chance to make adjustments of his own.

After decades of taking hops advice from foreign brewers, American craft brewers are beginning to return the favor. Several are now exporting their beers, and others are inviting upstart foreign brewers stateside for a lesson in brewing American favorites such as double IPAs (an India pale ale amped up with extra hops to intensify the flavor). Or, as with Stone, they are getting a surprisingly bubbly reception in the bid for permanent resident status abroad.
Western Avenues is, at 24.7 miles, the city's longest street. There are, by best calculation, 64 bars, taverns, saloons, pubs, clubs and dives along those miles. They are of all types — from the lively Irish joints in Beverly to some neighborhood spots where no one speaks English — and the two men had a drink at each of them (sometimes more than one), walking all the way. That it took them four days, filming a great deal of action along the way for a 25-minute documentary, should in no way diminish the importance of it all.

Blanc de noirs: Two of the three traditional Champagne grapes (Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier) are red, but treated as white grapes in the winemaking process and leave little or no color in the wine. Blends made entirely from red grapes are labeled this way, though the term can be used for any white (or almost white) wine made entirely from red grapes. Should not be confused with rosé, which in sparkling wine often describes a wine made from both white and red grapes, with some still red wine added in later that gives it color.

New Jersey passed its law limiting emissions in 2004. But it’s down-wind from other power plants not currently regulated.

Now, the latest. Since my columns about Lauri and Josh, the following have occurred: George has taken legal steps to have Josh booted from the Laguna Niguel home George co-owns with Gina; to have Gina booted while he's trying to sell it (as part of their divorce); and to require Gina and their teenage son, Slayte, preserve all of their computer files, voice mail and email in which the divorce proceedings have been referenced. Sounds like a prelude to further legal action and/or simple intimidation.

"ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE": The statistical horrors of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge regime are understood -- in four years, approximately 2 million citizens were executed, starved or worked to death -- but the precise motives and mindset driving those who planned and carried out these murderous policies have been harder to comprehend. In this absorbing, often unsettling documentary, journalist Thet Sambath uses respect, gentleness and patience to draw out matter-of-fact testimonials from several fellow Cambodians who, as a matter of survival, killed hundreds or even thousands of their neighbors. Even more impressively, Sambath gains the trust of Pol Pot's former ideologist Nuon Chea (now awaiting trial for war crimes) and eventually persuades him to explain the motivations of the Khmer Rouge's leadership for the genocide.

So if you start to write in a way that people don’t like and you’re starting to cover topics that aren’t that popular, you have immediate traffic statistics you can look at and evaluate. ...Yes, what I do is a form of art, but it’s also kind of a commodity.

What really lights people up is the food. The 28-year-old chef has a passion and unrelenting curiosity that leads him to not only reproduce but also improve combinations that appear on a standard Chinese menu. On one visit he brought out a bowl of Chinese barbecue sauce, his next project.

He doesn't necessarily try to be authentic, but in the end his food comes across as having more purity and integrity than 99 percent of the Chinese restaurants in the city.

Well, he makes "recess appointments" when the Senate isn't in recess, thus circumventing the dreary business of confirmation by that "democratically elected" legislature he likes so much. But, hey, it's only members of the National Labor Relations Board and the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, so why get hung up on constitutional niceties?

After all, we've earned that pleasure. There has been enough grim news about the Chesapeake Bay, including a most-recent D+ annual report card and the need to put more anti-pollution laws and fees on the books.

"I think for the players, it's a huge thing," said Jeremy Alumbaugh, the SIUE assistant soccer coach and a coach for an Illinois SLSG team. "It's helpful for the coaches as well. Obviously with these kids going 10 months a year, we'll be around them even more than we are currently. Trying to motivate them for an entire year is more of a challenge. Any little advantage can only help those players in their pursuit of whatever they want to be."

There are tea party activists who believe that any federal power must be specifically enumerated in the text of the Constitution – and then interpret the Constitution as if it were the Articles of Confederation.

Closely connecting Hockney's unfolding life and art has two prime virtues. During the 1950s, an age that valued American abstract painting most highly, Hockney emerged as an unrepentant figurative painter. Without belaboring the point, the book also embeds that art in a young artist's tumultuous daily existence. Sykes neatly chronicles both in sometimes striking detail, a talent perhaps enhanced by the author's other profession as a photographer.

The bill could have been worse. Senate GOP leaders, in tandem with Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, derailed -- at least for now -- a strict identification requirement that would have made voting more difficult for many older and less affluent Ohioans. And while the changes probably will make early voting more difficult initially, some Democrats' talk of disenfranchisement was overblown. Remember that when "no-fault" early voting was approved, almost no one dreamed it would be so widely used -- nor was it, until Barack Obama's campaign tapped its potential in 2008.

Such a use unto itself may not offend you, but remember -- that's only what you can see. Indeed, nobody has any comprehensive idea of how tech companies are using these provisions in their secret business-to-business dealings.

The statistics tell a dire, but incomplete, story. We were built to work. When we want to and can't, it is an assault on our very personhood.
