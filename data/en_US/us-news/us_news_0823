He eventually moved to Porterville and published an autobiography that reflected, he recalled in "Unknown Legends," "my having been a teenager in the '50s, a rock celebrity in the '60s, a guru in the '70s and a Christian from the '80s on. My life has paralleled the decades of American change."
Unlike Bachmann or Perry, Gingrich didn't melt down entirely. Before Christmas, he still led or was in a dead heat with Romney in most national polls. But his Iowa numbers are worse, and he's trying to stay in the top three with barely a skeleton staff in the state. He needs to remain viable until South Carolina and Florida -- where he still polls well -- and hope that success there will translate into cash for a prolonged battle with Romney. Gingrich's failure to make the ballot in Virginia, his new home state, was a reminder that glibness gets you only so far.

Subjugation of women, mistreatment verbally and physically is a predicament for the whole human race, no matter what the faith or ethnic origin is.

The door panel of a Buick LaCrosse may be completely different from the door panel of a Chevrolet Malibu, but the structural steel inside those doors is very similar. So Parma can still ship parts, and lots of them, to multiple plants. The structural pieces are so small that 300 might fit in the same size box as a dozen door panels. And on parts that car buyers never see, cosmetic dents don't matter.

If "Home" (2011), created by Rennie Harris, is any indication, the ensemble has a bright future. The work, which draws upon the stories of people living with HIV and the club scenes where many seek solace, blended hip-hop and contemporary dance into episodic experiences. Movement was slowed down, methodically taken apart, and then revved up into real time again -- as if some unseen DJ were controlling the spatial dimensions.

For perspective, a single abdominal CT scan provides a patient with the radiation equivalent of approximately 400 chest x-rays. Interaction of radiation particles with human DNA results in sometimes permanent genetic changes. These interactions are cumulative over time and disproportionately affect the sensitive tissues of younger people, resulting in deleterious effects on the body, such as cancer. Thus, the result of the over-radiating of the American public may not be known for years.

To decrease cheating, students must be reminded why they are going to school -- and that is not an easy thing to do. Professor O'Connell figured something out. Since his comment, not a single person has attempted to cheat on his or her homework.

The latest statements from Tomblin and Manchin are in keeping with their previous comments about the president.

But what's a fat book got to do with the state of the Chesapeake Bay? Around the world, coastal waters have gotten fat. "Eutrophic," or overfertilized, is the technical term, from the Greek for well-fed. Dead zones like the bay's occur in more than 40 regions of the world.
"To be honest with you, I was always taught that people who had anxiety issues were just weak-minded people," he said. "Now that it's happened to me, you see you can't control it.

This is the second time the deadline for the final report has been pushed back. When the task force was constituted in February 2011, the report was expected to be released later in the year. In July, Soriano said each subcommittee’s report would be due at the end of December, with a final report released by him on March 1.
"It's nice this year when we don't get asked every day about something we didn't do. We haven't done as much as we want, and we know it," Tulowitzki said.

The two create some poignant moments together, especially late in the first act when Mark coaxes Judith out of her chair despite her fear of falling. The tenderness and the tension are palpable as he helps her stand then urges her to teach him to dance, assuring her that he's there to catch her. Other times, though, the affection they're meant to have for each other feels artificial.
An Arizona Senate committee approved a bill late Tuesday designed to set up a U.S. Supreme Court case on automatic citizenship for children of illegal immigrants.

When the girl's mother learned that he was still in town, she contacted the school on March 30.
Korda gives a clear, rather gripping account of Lawrence's vision of what a postwar Middle East might look like—one with a viable Jewish homeland in Palestine, which he convinced his great ally, the Hashemite prince Feisal , to accept, and rational borders for new, independent Arab nations. The betrayal of legitimate Arab aspirations by the British and French was, Korda writes, "the primary guilt that Lawrence bore, and that explains much of his life from 1922 to his death in 1935," a period in which he worked at literature and life as a private soldier and airman under assumed names.
NEW YORK - "Veep" is getting a second term on HBO, as is the comedy "Girls."
Rice told the editorial board of The Oregonian that the Obama administration expects an "orderly transition" to democracy following the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

On Friday, Tarsem Singh's "Mirror Mirror," a zippy new version of the Snow White story, arrived, and yet another retelling, "Snow White and the Huntsman," is threatened for this year. "Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters" looms on the horizon too, scheduled for early 2013. And two of the livelier series of the current television season, "Grimm" and "Once Upon a Time," are based on tricky fairy-tale premises. Not all these movies and shows are destined to live happily ever after in the memories of their target audiences, but the entertainment industry, with its childlike trust in the powers of its own magic, clearly believes we'll be enchanted.
He has gotten to Saturday, Moving Day as it is called, in the hunt, only three shots back after a 6-under 66. Ahead is Masters Sunday and perhaps a calendar turning from a self-destructive past to a brighter tomorrow.
Today’s terminations come in the wake of an assessment conducted by the State Police, which in February was asked to take over security of the facility after the discovery of a small hole drilled into the office of the executive director — allowing anyone to eavesdrop from a storeroom below, officials said.

"In one breath, you could say everything is on the line," Borchetta said. "But when you really step back, it's just record No. 3, and this is not going to be her last record, whether it sells 5 million copies or a million and a half. That's for her fan base to decide."
Despite a few letdowns like Saturday's, Boston has been remarkably consistent, not losing more than two games in a row all season, and has done so despite injuries. Point guard Rajon Rondo has missed 11 games, forward Kevin Garnett has missed nine, and the centers have been a revolving door, with Shaquille O'Neal and Jermaine O'Neal in and out of the lineup all season, and incumbent starter Kendrick Perkins possibly making his season debut next week.

The treatment of such disorders has long been the subject of debate. Early surgery to assign a child's gender is controversial, but prenatal treatment for congenital adrenal hyperplasia is even more alarming, said Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of Advocates for Informed Choice. She adds that the complicated surgery carries risks, including infection and nerve damage, and that parents may not be adequately counseled beforehand. The group favors allowing children born with intersex conditions to participate in decisions about their gender identity, including delaying a decision until adolescence.
We've been collecting Rodarte from the beginning ... some Garth Pugh. I'd like to get more Riccardo Tisci and don't yet have any Haider Ackermann yet but we want to get Haider Ackermann for the collection. We have hundreds in the collection. A lot of Commes de Garcon ... apart from being one of my personal favorites. WWD (Women's Wear Daily) did a survey of who designers thought of as important and a huge number of designers said Rei Kawakubo (of Commes de Garcon). She's not making the most money of other designers but the designers are saying that we really look at what she does.
Even if PG&E knew about the seam, it "would not have changed the integrity management assessment methodology PG&E determined was most appropriate," the company said.

This recipe is from my friend Victoria's mother, who makes this every year for Tet. She buys the pork butt, fish sauce and fresh coconut from Asian markets like Dai Thanh Supermarket (420 S. Second St., San Jose) and 99 Ranch Market (250 Skyline Plaza, Daly City). To get juice from the coconut, simply slice off the top with a sharp knife and pour juice out. Serve with jasmine rice.

Vehicles that have not been tested will be listed initially as "not rated."
Former Gov. Parris N. Glendening's proposal to let voters decide whether to build transportation projects ignores the long history of disconnect between the state's plans and outcomes, which cannot be resolved by a simple yes or no by voters ("Voters will support transportation projects," April 22).
"There's quite a few people signed up for" the employee shares, Schmidt said. GM officials declined to share numbers, but employees said the stock sale is the buzz of worker community. Schmidt said when he called to check on his paperwork, offices in Detroit were swamped with employee stock requests.
Over the long run, both the U.S. and Pakistan have little choice but to work together against a determined enemy that threatens them both. Pakistan may never completely give up the idea that its bitter rivalry with India demands it support some terrorist organizations in Afghanistan and Kashmir. We believe that's a short-sighted and ultimately self-destructive policy because sooner or later those groups are bound to turn on their would-be patrons. What's important for America, however, is how well the U.S. and Pakistan can work together to counter the most pressing threats they share in common. We may never be the best of friends with Pakistan, but continued constructive engagement with its government and military may be enough to assure a future for our two countries' troubled alliance in the war on terror.
That Sporting Kansas City have won its first 7 games to start the season. Or that it beat five consecutive Western Conference opponents. Or that KC have earned 21 points on the season (a number the team didn't reach last season until July 6!). Or that Sebastien Le Toux's goal in the 79th minute was the first allowed in the run of play this season. Or that a team actually out-shot Sporting. Or that Jimmy Nielsen had a streak of 415 minutes without allowing a goal. Or that it was the first time KC rolled out the dark blue (and much better looking) jerseys.
The case against Winfrey was largely circumstantial. Police never recovered the gun used to kill Hanneken, and they found no physical evidence tying Winfrey to the scene of the murder.
In the end, that brings us back to the essential problem of a project such as this one: that it is impossible to tell a story before it is done. There's still too much we don't know about the Giffords shooting, beginning with the fate of Giffords herself. As for Loughner, it's clear from the traces he left behind that he's as dissociated as they come. "I'm in a terrible place," he declared in a video posted on YouTube in fall 2010: a brief moment of clarity in an otherwise rambling monologue. It is from out of such a place that he acted on Jan. 8, 2011 — a place that, despite Zoellner's arguments to the contrary, has less to do with Arizona than with his own bleak and jumbled inner world.
And it wasn't decided until Wisconsin's Jordan Taylor missed a long three-pointer with three seconds left. Josh Gasser got the rebound, but his toss toward the basket was off at the buzzer.
There's not always just a catch. Sometimes there's two. No sane analyst would demand they trade "A list" prospects since just when they've started actually developing some. But there's enough middle ground to satisfy a dual agenda. Wiggle room abounds between making an acquisition that costs you top prospects, and improvement on what we're seeing in the outfield these days.

In the six months since Mayor Cory Booker announced an unprecedented effort to turn around the state’s largest school district, the mood in Newark has devolved from skepticism to open hostility.

Every one of last year’s top-10 hits was a fantasy of some sort — cartoons, super-hero adventures, sci-fi stories. Some were even fairly intelligent and extremely well-made — even though there wasn’t a film among them rooted in reality, and few had anything like a recognizable adult.

So then we must ask, "Why is the federal spigot running dry?" A large part of the reason is because Republicans obstruct any national stimulus proposals or any attempts to raise taxes on the super-wealthy (who keep vacuuming up more and more of our nation's wealth). Therefore, the federal government is less able to help Maryland with infrastructure and those burdens are placed on the middle and lower income groups at the state and local level.

With a gift occasion coming around, I honestly feel like getting him squat. He has so many toys, he doesn't appreciate them. I asked him to stop throwing his toys in the bin, they'll break, and he said, "Who cares, I'll just buy more." I bought him a spontaneous gift once. He asked me to return it; he wanted something else. Between this and crying whenever he doesn't win, he's getting harder to be around.
But Sheikh Laith, as he was known, had joined the escalating ranks of Sunni clerics who were providing spiritual validation to the then-burgeoning insurgency. He embraced a militant stance early on. It seems naive now, after so many clerics and mosques in Iraq have been implicated, but at the time it was unclear that the anti-U.S. campaign would garner so much religious support--or that disenfranchised Sunni Arabs from places such as Fallouja would become the principal foot soldiers in an uprising that would thwart the most potent military force on the planet.

The call: Pujols drops again, and finishes with 33.

"I’m more concerned about the vitriol that’s playing out on the national stage and occasionally does happen in New Jersey," Gusciora said. "But I think we do have to do better at working with people across the aisle. Our constituencies really want us to work together. They don’t mind an occasional ‘numb nuts,’ but they do want us to work together to lower our taxes."
Cheeses we liked: Idiazabal, a sheep’s milk cheese from Spain; Prairie Breeze, a dry, crumbly cheddar from Milton Creamery in Iowa; burrata, a soft, ultra-creamy cheese; and Ossau-Oraty, a French sheep’s milk cheese and the Munchmobile driver’s favorite cheese of the day.
Tony's take: Jets play so much better with backs against the wall. Jets, 23-20.
Commissioners who favor the lease have said the public would win because the agreement calls on USC to refurbish the Coliseum and ensures the stadium's future as home to the school's Trojan football team.

"Everything was tied up with having a real good time," he said.
Now, imagine this wasn't an interview, "which is an unnatural situation," he says, "and we just met on a plane and started talking. Man, we'd have so much in common. I got to figure out when I'm going to be quiet and when I'm going to ask you something. You have to figure out what you're going to pick up on. We're swinging! So the ultimate swing is when opposite poles comes together and are forced into a dance with each other."
That a colorful ex-organized crime lawyer could be a three-term mayor, then be succeeded by his wife, says a lot about how much Las Vegas views its longtime relationship with the mob. What outsiders might view as the bad old days are seen from inside the Clark County line as the good old days.
"I will state unequivocally for every person watching tonight: I have never once changed my position because of any kind of payment," Gingrich said. "The truth is I was a national figure, I was doing just fine. I was doing a whole variety of things including writing best-selling books, making speeches and the fact is I only chose to work with people whose values I share and having people have a chance to buy a house is a value I believe is still important in America."
Alison Sweeney now greets them and congratulates them on making it to the final four. Since this is "The Biggest Loser," that means we now hear everybody saying again that they've made it to the final four. How else are they going to fill the two hours without people repeating everything a zillion times? I don't know, but I wish somebody would give this some thought, and come up with a different answer.
It's incumbent upon the coaches to coach and the players to play. But even more important, is the task in front of general manager Rich Cho. He must take the expiring contracts of Joel Przybilla and Andre Miller and attempt to alter the course of the franchise.

Florida's laws certainly don't make it safer for young blacks wearing hoodies and carrying Skittles. Trayvon also did everything the "stupid" Florida law requires; he offered no resistance, he tucked his tail and walked away. And a fat lot of good it did him. A man, who was told by the police not to pursue him, shot him anyway.

One of the things I like to do when visiting the Missouri-side location of Randall's Wine and Spirits, 1910 South Jefferson Avenue, is to search for bargains in the wall display of wines that have earned at least 90 points from critics. There aren't many on that particular wall that are priced below $15, but I can usually find a few - and they're always well-worth trying.
They're an excellent source of protein and are packed with fiber and other plant-based nutrients. Plus, they're extremely low in fat, can prolong the feeling of fullness after a meal, and can help control blood-sugar levels.

But cost sometimes is less of a barrier than availability of service. Last winter's snow and cold snaps were a case in point: The pool of drivers shrank when the volunteers didn't want to tackle the roads or sidewalks.
"It's not going to be as difficult as our defense was last year," said Ward. "We had a bunch of schemes and a bunch of techniques and calls that, I think at times, confused some of the guys on defense and maybe our cohesion wasn't there as well last year. But I think this year it's more basic and you just use your athletic ability and skills as a football player to make plays."
Cubs in Chicago for Sunday night national telecasts as FSM loses those games. The Aug. 14 contest was one of the 20 FSM Cards telecasts that ATT U-verse was scheduled to black out as part of a contract dispute. So the game the following night, Aug. 15 at Pittsburgh, is to be withheld by U-verse instead. The Cubs telecast was not on the blackout list, so it will be on U-Verse.
Reese had been spotted on security camera footage at the train station earlier in the day and was recognized during a review of the video surveillance.
Humber hit Hafner in the third inning. He started icing the knee right after the inning and stayed in the game. It was a good thing. His two-out single in the fifth brought Carlos Santana to the plate and he promptly hit a long three-run homer to give the Indians a 3-1 lead. In the ninth, after Jack Hannahan's two-out double gave the Indians a 4-3 lead in the eighth, Hafner's two-run homer secured a 6-3 victory.

The menu is small, but Mattern changes it often, so even if you've been there the week before, you'll always find a few new enticing and hyper-seasonal dishes. His cooking has a relaxed assurance that's pure California. He doesn't try too hard or strain for effect, instead letting the ingredients speak for themselves. Like a painter who works with a characteristic palette, Mattern puts down his flavors side by side, working texture and color into his compositions in a way that seems natural and effortless.
An NTV crew showed up this year when he was meeting with another famous Russian political figure. It ran a documentary in March called "Anatomy of Protest" in which they showed what the opposition argued was faked video of people taking money or other gifts to participate inanti-government protests.

Subscribe to the RSS feed.Switching to a healthier form of fandom, Timbers fans have received a lot of good press lately. Perhaps the most expansive article was in the May 23 issue of Sports Illustrated. The article was framed around the Cascadia Cup soccer rivalry between Portland, Seattle and Vancouver, but some of the strongest praise was reserved for the Timbers, which the article called "the new darlings" of MLS, and in particular the Timbers Army.

Now, this is not to criticize what owner Arte Moreno and new General Manager Jerry Dipoto did. Some of you might think a 10-year, $240 million deal was a little steep for Albert Pujols, but you just don't realize how tough it is to find a quality defensive first baseman, particularly since Doug Mienkiewicz retired.
"The impact of the tsunami disaster on Toyota is extremely severe," said Kato. "Since Toyota depends so much on domestic parts suppliers, any major disruptions in supply chains could cripple its output."

The script isn't as strong. For instance, a scene in which Miller and Olivier drink and talk should have been electric -- two geniuses swapping stories -- but instead it is perfunctory, almost clichéd. Scenes between Clark and Olivier fare better; Olivier is comfortable enough around Clark to talk about his frustrations, at one point telling his charge that directing a film is the best job in the world, and that after working with Monroe he'll never do it again. (And he didn't, at least not until 1970, when he directed "Three Sisters").
From a longer-term viewpoint, however, the market's recent swings have been relatively mild. The Dow plunged nearly 550 points in the five days ending Tuesday, a molehill compared to the mountain of last summer's frightening drops. Those included an 858-point, eight-day plunge in July and August, as Congress bickered over government debt limits and the S&P prepared to downgrade the U.S. debt rating.

Depends on whom you ask, but the consensus thinking is that commissioner Gary Bettman and new NHLPA director Donald Fehr will do what it takes to avoid a lockout. Still, the negotiations could get ugly, especially if NHL owners demand that players take a reduction in their share of league revenues, down to 50 percent, as the NBA did. NHL players currently get 57 percent of the revenue. That number is likely to go down, but the revenue number is smaller in the NHL than NBA, so it was easier for NBA players to take a reduced percentage, because their average salaries are much higher than that of hockey players.

The steaks are wet-aged, the same as most of the prime-steak-specialty places in town save for Prime 1000, which dry-ages. And the wood-fired grilling technique is spot-on, providing an excellent surface crusting and a hint of smoky edge to the slightly fatty texture of our 18-ounce bone-in rib eye ($39) and the elegant firmness of a 12-ounce strip steak ($35). For obvious reasons, the strips here are called Kansas City instead of New York. We added a $3 scoop of ancho chile butter on the rib eye, and its moderate spiciness was a good foil for the fatty richness of the meat.

The state said the law is constitutional because it applies to each group of workers only when their current labor contracts expire.
Westbrook echoed that sentiment.
Maybe that's why the 1912 convention proposed, and voters ratified, a constitutional amendment that empowers the legislature to "provide for the conservation of the natural resources of the state." Too bad today's Republican-led General Assembly snubs "the people" and sweet-talks the very monopolies T.R. despised.

"In regards to those seatbelts that they want to put on school buses, I don't think it's a good idea. I am a firefighter and I work on a heavy rescue wagon. I wouldn't want to be sent out to a call of a burning bus or one that has flipped and ends up upside down in a river or lake, with 50 kids strapped in there and aren't able to get out. A lot of times they can get themselves out. I wouldn't want to respond to a disastrous accident involving a bus with a lot of kids strapped in there. In some instances it may save their life, but in other instances it may take their life."

Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and a co-author of the meat study, says it presented relative rather than absolute risk as the latter "varies substantially according to different age and sex groups as well as other risk factors," such as smoking and lack of physical activity. So while the study calculated a percentage increase in chance of death that should roughly apply to all groups, each group has a different baseline mortality risk.

Emerging Christians don't have a monopoly on spirituality for the nones, however. L.A.'s East Side Jews often meet for discussion, comedy nights or outreach projects. Although they bill themselves as "an irreverent, non-denominational collective for Jews with confused identities," their events usually have a spiritual thread as well.
