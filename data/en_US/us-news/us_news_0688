Soft-tissue lasers typically don't cause bleeding because the concentrated energy seals off blood vessels as it removes the tissue; lasers also seal off nerve endings, so pain signals are not transmitted to the brain, Mungo says.

"Those guys over there in the other locker room were NBA champions last year," Wallace said. "We just came into their house, took their best punches ... gave them our best punches and they barely squeaked a out a win. We feel like we were the better team tonight, they were just able to get a win some kind of way."
“Tonight we really focused on being tough early,” Graves said. “Then that toughness showed through the game. We built the lead and then they would come back. Then we would answer the call and build it back up.

One might think his oddball ideas and the willingness to fill his editorial pages with them – often including long, complicated passages from Hoiles' favorite writers on economics and liberty – would make it hard for him to succeed in the free market.

The company he founded now runs more than two dozen daily papers and eight TV stations, even though at times his advocacy for right-to-work laws or for closing down local military bases cost him thousands of subscription cancellations.

Bill McWhorter, owner of Westside Materials Inc. in Cleveland, met Maculaitis about six months ago at an Akron Urban League event. He was feeling discourged before he told her about a project he had hoped his demolition and trucking company could take part in. She helped helped him find another source for raw materials with lower prices. That made the difference in landing a $3 million account annually for the next three years.
Nine years ago, Maculaitis was a 27-year-old office manager working at a small family-owned industrial cleaning company in Canton. Her former boss, Tim Tarry, told her that he was ready to sell his company but had an idea for another venture. For many years he had listened to purchasing agents complain about the hassle of finding smaller miscellaneous products that didn't fit with their normal purchasing activities.

Patsy’s Tavern in Paterson is so old-school it should have its own district. The neighborhood bar, with its wooden booths, was opened in 1931 by Pasquale Barbarulo; his grandsons, Steve and Gary, now run the place. You’ll come for the food, not the furnishings. One must: the pizza, with its thin, crispy crust. The broccoli rabe is garlicky-good, and the rice balls received raves. The lasagna is astoundingly cheesy; you might wish for more sauce.

LA is good. Jonathan Quick is tremendous. But the Blues can play with them. Just for a moment, forget about which Blues forwards aren't producing offense, what the power-play stats are and the plus-minus of the team's defensemen.

Mr. Wagner's chief attribute is his experience in state government. He served in the legislature for 16 years and could provide a steadying presence on a council dominated by political neophytes evidently intent on demonstrating the down side of term limits. He has a long association with Mr. Jones, meaning he could presumably offer some continuity in the district's representation, and he is a political moderate, which could help him in dealing with a polarized council.
The request triggers involvement of the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a federal agency that will fight for the employees' rights.

The only way a regressive tax system makes sense from a policy perspective is if you buy into trickle-down economics - and the only way you buy into trickle-down economics is if you ignore three decades of growing economic inequality.

Edano said Wednesday that the prime minister's office had begun publishing a newspaper to distribute to shelters to keep evacuees better informed about what the government was doing to help them. Such papers are necessary, he said, because many elderly evacuees cannot search out information on computers and even those who can are still facing power shortages.
Of course, you find even more opportunities to pay less than you otherwise might. Any time you're in a captive or semi-captive situation, you can expect to be gouged. Hotel minibars are the prototypical captive gouge; your obvious defense is either to buy somewhere else or forego the item entirely. Hotel laundries are often so expensive that you'd pay less to go out and buy new items -- I've occasionally done that when a hotel's price list showed $7 for a pair of ordinary socks. You can also expect to be gouged at any port-area shop "recommended" by a cruise line's "port lecturer" or any store where your tour bus stops for a "break."
Hellman disdained a system that made her fabulously rich while romanticizing one that made its citizens spectacularly poor.

Santa Ana has some of the O.C.'s grittiest corners, but it's also home to a pair of worthwhile museums and a growing number of galleries. The kid-focused Discovery Science Center (2500 N. Main St., Santa Ana; www.discoverycube.org) stands beneath a big black cube at the edge of Interstate 5 (the cube conceals a facsimile rocket) and has hands-on exhibits that cover populist themes such as the science of hockey, plus there's a modest climbing wall. About four blocks south of the cube is the more grown-up Bowers Museum (2002 N. Main St., Santa Ana; www.bowers.org). The Bowers is a cultural museum, meaning it's just as likely to tell you about Benjamin Franklin as it is to show you Chinese adornments or an amazing pair of red and gold African earrings. It also has a children's Kidseum space (1802 N. Main St.; www.bowers.org/kidseum). If you want to see work by living homegrown artists, head to the nearby Artists Village area, park in the structure at North Broadway and West 3rd Street, and prowl gallery spaces such as the Orange County Center for Contemporary Art (117 N. Sycamore St., Santa Ana; www.occca.org), the Grand Central Art Center (125 N. Broadway, Santa Ana; www.grandcentralartcenter.com) and the quirky old Santora Arts Building (207 N. Broadway, Santa Ana; www.aplaceforart.org/galleries/santora). The restaurants Gypsy Den (125 N. Broadway, Unit D; www.gypsyden.com) and Memphis at the Santora (201 N. Broadway, Santa Ana; www.memphiscafe.com/santora) are handy for a bite. And if you go on a Santa Ana Artwalk (first Saturday night of every month; four-block 2nd Street Promenade in Artist’s Village, Santa Ana; www.santaanaartwalk.com), a few dozen nearby galleries will be open as well.

So when Rafe's reaction to an assembly presentation of the school's code of conduct is the goal of breaking every rule in the book, no one is there to offer a smarter path.

Like the other writers, the students get to work with skilled actors and directors as they write and rewrite, and get to observe some of the rehearsals, discussions and interactions of the larger group of theater professionals. The depth and craft of what they write is remarkable, down to an intriguing knack for finding thematic resonance with the longer plays that followed them.

I received my first real baseball glove when I was 10 years old. How proud I was when my father took me to the store and bought me a Spalding outfielder's glove. I played ball all day and into the evening with that glove - six days a week - for a month before "it" happened. Our family went on a road trip for a week and I had left my glove outside in the elements. When I got home, I rushed to reclaim it. I found it in the back yard. When I picked it up, it was ruined. It had rained and completely soaked the leather. To make matters worse, the sun had baked it into a hard, cracked mess.

It all hangs together securely enough, and it almost feels cruel to deny heavy rotation to a song so desperate to succeed. If you are a radio listener, there’s a good chance that no matter what you think of Minaj’s dodgy career moves, you’ll find yourself singing along to the chorus of "Starships" at a club or backyard barbecue this summer. This is the pop song as Hollywood blockbuster: a big-budget compendium of clichés and cheap thrills, rehashed and spit-polished to a garish shine. It’s the wide-release flick you duck in to see on a 95-degree day when all you want is distraction and air conditioning. It’s gruesome, but since you know you’ll never think about it again, you’re willing to ignore the Frankenstein seams and enjoy the ride.

The steak frites ($23.95), a special during our visit that will be a regular entree on the new menu, suffered from a similar lack of oomph. The New York strip, served sliced over a bed of arugula, was cooked correctly but underseasoned, though we enjoyed the spicy horseradish sauce served on the side. Accompanying truffle fries were cut too thick to qualify as bona fide frites, but the heady scent of truffle oil and dusting of truffle salt and Parmesan were welcome additions.

I lived in New Orleans for nearly six glorious years, and that's one thing I took away from the place — unlike any other city, New Orleans cherishes all the quirky local intricacies that make it America's most eclectic and electric city (no offense, Buffalo).

And then, when the judges questioned doing something that obscure at this point in the race, she told them, "I thought EVERYBODY knew that song," which only underscored how out of touch she is with the popular culture of 2012 or, frankly, this millennium while telling viewers, "If you didn't recognize that song, you clearly don't know music, loser."

I've gotten no indication from Gee he wants to play elsewhere, so it's just a matter of striking a deal. I'll be interested to see how much the Cavs offer him. He's a starter right now on a bad team, but ultimately he might return to the bench where he was so effective to begin the season. The Cavs love his energy, athleticism and attitude. As for Gibson, about half of his $4.8 million for next season is guaranteed. My guess is he will be back with the team, at least to start the season.

If angels are the new vampires, then "Embrace" is a worthy follow-up to "The Twilight Saga."

Because of the circuit's track record, Megaplex has developed a working relationship with a number of movie studios.

Lush, dense, utterly ripe -- 2007 was a warm vintage -- yet buoyed by barbera's intrinsically high acidity, this is a benchmark barbera. Oh, and there's one other tasty thing: the price. Barbera d'Alba Superiore 2007 from Monchiero sells for $12.95 a bottle. I cannot recall recommending a barbera this good, at that low a price, in at least a decade. Get it while you can. (Distributor is Casa Bruno.)

The Ravens will host plenty more prospects in the weeks ahead. There is a lot that goes into deciding what prospects come to team facilities in the days before the draft. Obviously, teams want to get to know certain prospects better or have their doctors and trainers check out potential medical concerns. Some teams bring in certain guys as a smoke screen, hoping that the competition will believe that they’re all in on one guy while the player that they really want flies under the radar. Ravens director of player personnel Eric DeCosta acknowledged last week that they bring in certain guys that they know they won’t draft, but the familiarity with them and vice versa will help the organization down the road.
