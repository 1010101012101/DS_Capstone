If a manager was to respond to a "better offer" let them go. In this state, and across this country, we still have high unemployment. Do you not suppose there is an unemployed HR director out there that would like a job for probably less then is being paid now? I am tired of hearing the old diatribe "in order to keep good people." This is an employers market, not the other way around.

Happy Peanut Month! March is almost over, but it's not too late to wish you an appropriate greeting of the season.

A big thing of mine is listening to people better. I'm learning to step back a bit and let the conversation unfold versus immediately just giving my opinion. Sometimes I think as leaders you can voice your opinion, and then it can douse the creativity of the group. I think that is something Debbie and I are working on, and have made strides. As a leader in an organization, it is probably your decision to make as to what direction you go, but if you don't even allow people to identify their ideas, have an open roundtable of communication and together come up with a solution, I think that can impact an organization in a negative way.
The loss to the Wings came after many of the players traveled to Denver the day before. The team, including Gallant, went through a 10 p.m. Thursday practice at the Pepsi Center. The commuters come in from, among other places, Vancouver and Toronto, plus Washington, D.C., Detroit, Buffalo and Minneapolis-St. Paul.

They understand that the payoffs may not come immediately. NASA will work for years to refine a single component for a single mission. Even the aviation firms that long have had strong ties to Glenn may build only a few hundred or a few thousand planes a year. Ford or Honda makes thousands of cars and trucks daily.

øBut also keep an eye on Luis Perez. He hasn't been scored upon in eight of nine relief appearances while showing comparable skills and a better ground-ball rate. In fact, his 2.77 ERA makes him the Blue Jays most effective reliever. The former starter's ability to go multiple innings has made him invaluable as a setup man, but don't be surprised to see his role expand - whether in the bullpen or again as an starter, given the Jays' across-the-board pitching issues.

Ganguly, at least, has fired once, with a man of the match performance against Delhi Daredevils that included 41 with the bat and two wickets with the ball. The first of them, that of the immensely dangerous Kevin Pietersen, came off his first ball of the tournament, and prompted a howling, furrowed-browed, stiff-armed gallop of such intensity that it was as if the clock had been turned back and India's greatest captain was in charge of the national side again. Ganguly, you feel, would bring the same hyper-focused competitiveness to a game of backyard cricket, or tiddlywinks. It was as if his sheer will to win coaxed the performance out of him, even though his batting skills, in particular, look to be seriously on the wane.

Oh, yes, somewhere in the middle of all this, a football game is being played, which brings us back to this morning's press session. As you can see, after moving on from the topic of a playoff, Harbaugh shoots off in yet another quasi-bizarre direction by forecasting that Monday night's game could easily be a rout — either way. "They could blow us out," Harbaugh says before adding that Stanford could also do the same to Virginia Tech. I'm not sure I've ever heard a coach make that kind of prediction. But it's one reason Harbaugh is such a fascinating character — and will continue to be, wherever he winds up coaching next season.

The food, well, stinks: I’ve enjoyed some of the best meals of my life from anonymous street carts in Bangkok. But at trendy Momogoose truck in Dewey Square last week, my Spicy Thai Chicken was so bland I threw it out. Then I suffered through a “Blue Man Goo” sandwich from Grilled Cheese Nation with Great Hill blue cheese — my favorite local cheese! But the thin, malnourished sandwich lacked the much-anticipated “goo” and was a bad deal at $7. It also will be a long time before I order another Chinese sausage taco from Staff Meal. At least it was only $3.

That's where Nik comes in: Not only is he a private musician, but he's created a series of scrapbooks about his own fictional musical stardom that he calls "The Chronicles." Nik is partially based on a real person, Spiotta's stepfather — like Nik, he played in a couple of bands around L.A. and later invented a (less obsessive) scrapbook of imaginary achievements.

Andy Kadak, a consultant and former nuclear engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said during a press conference last month that he doesn't think transfer of spent fuel to casks would improve safety at plants.

So pools would still hold the hottest, most radioactive fuel.

Friedel's lineage was not the one that mattered Wednesday, though. The little girls playing with such loud joy know only players such as Solo, the USA team's goalkeeper, whose diving stop on a point-blank penalty kick beat Brazil in the quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup in Germany, or Wambach, who saved the team in the same game with a 122nd-minute goal on a header, the latest in World Cup history.

Catan Histories: Settlers of America (Mayfair, $55; 3-4 players; age 12+; 120 min.) This new installment in the Settlers of Catan franchise weds the familiar Catan hexagons and building resources to the shipping routes and goods delivery of railroad games. For the most part, it's a happy marriage. Players begin in the eastern United States and expand westward, building rail lines and depleting resources as they move; the directional flow of expansion is a nice variation on other Catan games. Unfortunately, the geographical vastness of North America, though economically advantageous in real life, works less well for a board game - this baby is huge. Each turn, and the game overall, takes longer than many players may want to devote.

"If Richardson is gone when the Browns pick, they'll trade down,down,down. Think about it, we don't need Kalil. Plenty of right tackles and they love Martin at 22. We don't need Claiborn.They just signed a corner for a zillion dollars and drafted Haden and Skrine. They can arguably get a better receiver than Blackmon at 6 or 8 in Floyd or Wright, or draft an impact linebacker, which they DO need and get a 2nd rounder to draft Weeden, who they also need..."

It seems insane to voluntarily install tracking software on your computer. And installing Prey does require a measure of faith. Rest assured that when Prey is in its dormant mode, it does only one thing: from time to time, it spends a few microseconds checking in with a central server to find to see if its owner has reported it as "missing." If not, Prey goes back to sleep.

Think about that in context with Cho's top-secret plan. Because the older players on this Blazers roster can't be part of the long-term solution. They have to go at some point.

"Glee" star Lea Michele sang "American the Beautiful" before the game, and Christina Aguilera handled the national anthem. Aguilera sang with bluesy grit but fumbled one of her lines, leaving out "O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming."

øIn her opinion, Southerners resisted change in all forms because it "is tied up with the precariousness of this inter-racial equilibrium upon which both sides depend.

"Edward has never heard of Cinco de Mayo, yet he will headline a professional band as the curtain falls and the credits roll. What's missing is any cross-cultural insight into the music itself." Edward, our protagonist, has no interaction with or opinion about Cinco de Mayo. The film depicts a Mexican Independence Day party, which is all I can assume Mr. Stamets is referring to. Apparently it's Mr. Stamets who doesn't know what Cinco de Mayo is. It's the holiday that happens on the 5th of May (not during the corn harvest season as depicted in the film) and not widely celebrated in Mexico. It's the holiday (in the USA) that a lot of gringos drink too much tequila and make nuisances of themselves. It's most certainly not Mexican Independence Day, the countries most important national holiday.

“Cabin,” he said, is a horror move about horror movies, but it differs from “Scream” in that it challenges horror fans to think about their relationship to the genre. “The movie has fun with horror-movie conventions, but at the same time I know that Joss and were frustrated with where the horror genre was going — the torture porn, violence for violence’s sake, the evisceration of young people,” he said. “ ?‘Cabin’ kind of questions the values of the audience that likes horror movies. There is something macabre in the idea that we like to watch this. Do you want the characters to escape, or do you want to see them suffer? It’s a puzzling thing to hold that mirror up to the audience.”

Mushrooms, toadstools and such can be ignored, and they should disappear in a few days. Or, you can gather them to discard.

Whether authorized under the commerce clause or not, all of these laws — including Obamacare — were enacted by the democratically elected institutions of government.

The massacre was carried out in the eastern Amazon town of Eldorado dos Carajas as the landless peasants gathered to protest for land reform. It has been symbolic of the impunity that exists in Brazil to this day when it comes to killings over land conflicts.

Agrarian reform remains a hot-button issue in Brazil, where just 3.5 percent of mostly rich landowners control more than half of the arable land in Latin America's largest nation and one of the globe's biggest agriculture powers.

Jones traded with the Broncos to move from No. 27 to No. 24 and take Oklahoma State receiver Dez Bryant.

Sports logos aren't supposed to be works of art, but in the NBA, it seems the designers are unimaginative—or taking their jobs too literally.
