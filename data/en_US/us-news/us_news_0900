The new $110 million, high-tech, energy-efficient center will house scores (and scores) of artifacts, and it will have its share of dioramas, and it will still work hard to present an accurate and inclusive picture of Colorado's past.

His work day begins at 6:30 a.m. and ends at around 3:30 p.m., leaving him time to coach in the afternoon and early evening. During a typical work day, Holden is in constant contact with traders, while also making sure certain accounts are “all squared away.” It’s early in his Knight tenure, but Holden has already noticed that his time with the Terps has given him a leg up.

As the Annie E. Casey Foundation reports, for example, three times as many African-American children live in poverty, compared with white children. One in five rural children lives in poverty, too. And one-third of America's children are in families where no parent has a full-time job. None of these statistics makes for compelling television, I realize.

One of the secrets of Chile's democratic and economic success -- Chile has reduced poverty from more than 40 percent of the population to 14 percent over the past 20 years -- was that the coalition that took over after Pinochet's dictatorship preserved some of the economic and foreign policies that had worked during the military regime, and replaced all others. It would be smart for Egypt and other Arab countries emerging from dictatorships to do the same.

It was great, really great. When I started kindergarten, I couldn't read my name. Jah is 5, and he's reading pretty well now. We're focusing mostly on languages and reading skills. His knowledge of Spanish comes from us giving him whatever he wanted to watch in Spanish, so he was watching "Sesame Street" in Spanish. Now, he can formulate a full sentence in Spanish. This emerging literacy is sort of opening up the whole world now. We wanted to home-school longer, if we could. Our idea was to keep them home as long as they can stand it, until they thirst for something else.

Councilwomen Rose Herrera, Nancy Pyle and Madison Nguyen were absent.
Le Pigeon: Rucker has an uncanny feel for food, and his flavors penetrate deep. In his hands the savory quality called "earthy" is more like a voyage to the center of the Earth. That's because the same ingredient often turns up in multiple formats in one dish, layering the essence in hidden but effective ways. These complexly nuanced ideas evolve out of pure instinct, and they hold the key to Rucker's distinctive cooking, his brand of genius. So the flinty wail of pecorino cheese running through a starter simply called "lamb belly, asparagus, pecorino" is no accident. The belly was first braised in olive oil, Dijon and, of all things, pecorino cheese, chosen in place of salt to convey a cheesy-salty perfume. Then he served it topped with a few fresh peas and asparagus bits --which sent forth a spring green flavor pop --and hit the top with shaved pecorino. The finishing touch? Dabs of mint pesto, boasting garlic and the nutty bite of . . . pecorino. In a word: Wow.
Mary Stanberg of Damascus, who lives along the Clackamas, told the commissioners Thursday that rowdiness has increased to the point that she has seen drunken rafters having sex on mattress floating down the river.

It used to be you were poor and idealistic (young) or rich and jaded (old). Now you can believe in changing the world—and do it.

A little farther north on Palos Verdes Drive, you'll reach at a grand blufftop chunk of land that longtime Angelenos will remember as site of the Marineland theme park from 1954-1987. Since 2009, these 102 acres have been the site of Terranea, a luxury resort that opened just in time to get kicked in the teeth by the recession. It has 582 hotel rooms (each at least 450 square feet) and rates that begin around $360, with a nine-hole golf course, spa, three pools, multiple restaurants and views of the Point Vicente lighthouse (next to which is the Point Vicente Interpretive Center, a prime whale-watching spot). Terranea is not a beach hotel – it's all about bluffs, rocks and pebbles. And if you're splurging, it's worth a thought. If you're not splurging, come anyway and grab a free parking spot (first lot on the left as you enter). Make the rounds on the well-appointed clifftop public trails and wind up around sunset at the casual resort restaurant that looks out toward the lighthouse. It's called Nelson's—an homage to Mike Nelson, the heroic SCUBA diver portrayed by Lloyd Bridges on television's "Sea Hunt" from 1958-61. The show was shot around here, in glorious black and white, and the restaurant walls are filled with posters (in jarring color) promoting ancient episodes. Give them a look. Then glance again to the sea, take a bite of seared ahi, and be glad. To be any more immersed in SoCal culture, you'd have to strap on air tanks and flip overboard backwards.

A. The '50s, that was New York at its best. It was a golden age of plays, of musicals - they never stopped, and we never stopped working, and it was so much fun. And it was so much more fun after you stopped working. Life began at midnight. Because you couldn't just walk offstage and go home. You needed to come down off that cloud nine, be anesthetized somehow. So off it would be to the bars. With Robards, mostly. For years, I would get into town, Betty Bacall would call, "Do you know where Jason is? I can't find him." "Ah yes, I have an idea." And I'd make a round of the pubs…

Perhaps even more telling, the proudly right-wing GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas appeared for the first time at a reception for the Log Cabin Republicans, a leading gay GOP organization. Cornyn had turned down invitations and even contributions from the Log Cabin group in the past. In September, he weathered significant criticism from the anti-gay Family Research Council.

Again: I loved "The Avengers." Other than Christopher Nolan's "Dark Knight" films, which are in a league of their own, this is one of the most entertaining films of the genre since the advent of the Superhero Movie Renaissance.

I had two surgeries and needed six chemotherapy treatments. I went back to work but it became more difficult because I became sicker after each chemotherapy treatment.

As I wrote in my 2009 book "A Field Guide to the Culture Wars," "Evangelicals and Catholics Together" was purportedly an exercise in ecumenism, designed to emphasize theological agreement between Catholics and evangelical Protestants. In fact, the document baptized cultural and economic conservatism. It railed against abortion, public schools that neglected the formative influences of Judaism and Christianity, a liberal tolerance that equated "the normative and the deviant," and pornography. It also committed the signatories to contending for "a free society, including a vibrant market economy."

I'm sure that many American's already believe that email and other new technology are killing the Postal Service. That simply is not true. What is bankrupting the Postal Service is a 2006 law that requires them to "pre-fund" retiree's health benefits for the next 75 years, and do so within a 10-year window. This unique burden, not required of any other government agency, accounts for 100 percent of Postal red ink over the last 5 years.

A: Alley has always written with a particular perspective. She has this interesting way of writing where she takes aspects of her own perspective on a situation and then makes it a complete and separate entity, and then writes from that person's perspective. ... I think halfway through writing the record, we looked down and realized it was happening again, but in a much more concise way. There was a realization that the whole record was coming from the perspective of this one person, Lafaye, which is obviously (Alley), but the decision to change the name of the character singing it is because there's something really universal about all of the situations in the songs.
Attorneys for the Marin-Fuentes family released a statement this morning, saying the news conference raised more questions than answers. Attorneys Greg Kafoury and Mark McDougal said the hospital's remarks and video surveillance still do not answer why no one from the hospital responded to Marin-Fuentes, only police and an ambulance paramedic.

The salad, which had a dressing that was more vinaigrette than creamy Caesar, was better and already cold, so there was no need to rush through it. The sirloin came with a too-sweet onion jam that didn't do much to enhance the peppery steak, but the meat was tender and very good.

"It's definitely a step in the right direction," said Leake, whose ERA dropped from 6.65 to 5.97. "Even though I had four walks, I was still happy with the way I threw the ball. I had a couple more mistakes than what showed, but they made me pay for two of them."

How much cortisol people produce in response to stress may also factor into the stress-weight gain equation. Several years ago, British researchers designed an ingenious study that showed that people who responded to stress with high cortisol levels in an experimental setting were more likely to snack in response to daily hassles in their regular lives than low-cortisol responders.

Bruce knew little about BMX. But he took the boys to their first race, stood in the back of his pickup truck with the tailgate down and started jumping up and down and whooping and hollering.
In theory, this was the year to chase a franchise quarterback. They had the ammunition and Robert Griffin III was worth the trouble. The easy thing would've been to scramble after losing out and convince themselves Matt Flynn was the answer. West Coast QB, West Coast system. It would've been an easy sell. But, for good reason, they didn't.
"Whether the anger continues will depend on economic policies," he said. "I think the country has reached its limits with fiscal adjustment, and cannot take further pressure as it is at the point of exploding."
-- America was losing the war in Vietnam to a peasant army of guerrillas. American troops had peaked, not at the current level in Afghanistan of about 100,000, but at 500,000. And the number of Americans who died in Vietnam was a horrifying 58,000.

Berkman also missed Sunday's game in Milwaukee, though the reason given was his difficult time against Randy Wolf in his career. Berkman has only three hits in 32 career at-bats against Wolf.
As I mentioned, you can do these and other things with a mouse and keyboard, but it's nowhere near as intuitive. Owners of traditional PCs are going to struggle with Windows 8 when it's out unless Microsoft makes some changes, and it's possible consumers may opt to stay away unless it shows up on a new PC. That's similar to the scenario Microsoft faced with Windows Vista, which is not something the company wants to repeat.
øThe impact caused roughly 200 gallons of fuel to spill onto the track, and it took nearly 10 minutes to extinguish. The race was stopped for more than two hours for repairs before the red flag was lifted with 40 laps remainning in the scheduled distance.

Team Tango, all in tuxedos, are doing a sloppy kick-line as we head into the commercial break before their dance. OK — time to dance — but first there's some faffing about holding violins - don't hurt the musical instruments, kids! The men are wearing actual trousers, while the women appear to be wearing skintight leggings. Sigh. After an initial bit of in-sync dancing with all four couples, they split off to showcase one couple at a time. Nothing too remarkable, except that Roshon can high kick almost as well as Chelise and she can darn near do a backbend while dancing and is practically a contortionist. Then they come back together, all eight of them, for some kaleidoscopic formations that really work best from the overhead Busby Berkley camera angle - I always wonder how that plays from the angle at the judges' table. Len says Maria and Roshon were the standout couples. He says the group was good, technically it was bad, and some of the lines were ugly. Bruno says the beginning and end choreography was excellent. He adds that Roshon KILLED it. Carrie Ann says it was incredible and singles Roshon out for praise as well.
"I think we pinned them in their own half, they couldn't get out and then we get hit with a sucker punch on the second, a great clearance from the goalkeeper, another wonder strike -- two wonder strikes in two weeks. Jamie Smith hit us last week and Javier Martina hit us with another one (today)."
"We will not try to compete with the NFL at all," said CEO Jaime Cuadra after adding Biletnikoff and James Bailey, an executive for the Cleveland Browns and then the Baltimore Ravens for 21 years, to the USFL's board of advisers.

The facts: Over the last 1 1/2 seasons, The Bullpen Mafia is 38-28 with 56 saves and a 3.46 ERA (282 earned runs in 732 2/3 innings). Bullpens can be the most volatile part of a ballclub, celebrated in victory, scorned in defeat.

Vásquez never loses his focus on Conrad. José describes meeting with Conrad in 1903 (when the novelist was immersed in writing "Nostromo") as well as a near-encounter 27 years earlier, when he was in the same Panamanian bar as young Conrad, then an apprentice sailor on a ship smuggling rifles to revolutionaries. José later learns that Conrad's companion that night was an Italian sailor upon whom he modeled the character Nostromo, the "man of the people" whose singular honor is severely tested. José bemoans his own absence from the story: "I'm the man who didn't see. I'm the man who didn't know. I'm the man who wasn't there. Yes, that's me. The anti-witness."

You see, like many Gwinnettians, I frequently travel through downtown Duluth for one reason or another. Until a few weeks ago my favorite, and most lovely path at this time of year with azaleas and dogwoods blooming, was closed to all but residents due to construction. McClure Bridge and West Lawrenceville roads, connecting Pleasant Hill Road to Highway 120 were closed with what appeared to be the installation of large sidewalks on both sides of the street.

It was called “God of Carnage,” and it was a robust, quick 10-rounder that ended in a split decision. No knockout punches, but lots of bruising jabs and fancy footwork. By the final bell, the combatants were still standing, but they were pretty much punch-drunk: No one seemed quite sure what the devil they had just been through, or why. And the great god Carnage seemed to be smiling from below, or leering, or sneering, or snickering, or whatever it is that the prevailing gods of violence and chaos like to do.

Unfortunately, the subsequent presses could lead to things such as the system playing a song I didn't want to hear.

As a prolific novelist, King is a legendary master of suspense. As a first-time playwright, he doesn’t really break new ground so much as he sticks to what he does best. Indeed, “Ghost Brothers” might impress as a freaky paranormal morality tale on the surface, but at its core it spins a story as ancient as Cain and Abel -- or, for one dysfunctional family living in backwoods Mississippi circa 2007, as recent as a mysterious tragedy from 40 years earlier.

"I do not work backwards like you guys," Thibodeau said in the interview room. "The score was going the other way. He's got to play. We sat him to about the seven-minute mark of the fourth quarter.

Crews faces an additional charge of child abuse for an incident in December, when he allegedly threw his 6-year-old son over a car seat in the house's family room and the boy landed on his shoulder, fracturing his clavicle. Crews initially denied throwing the boy, but when police spoke to the girlfriend about the child abuse claim, she told them about the meth lab. The St. Charles County Regional Drug Task Force served a search warrant at the home on Monday, and Crews confessed to cooking meth and abusing the boy.

Grube, who wisely turned to a career in golf management, arrived in Cromwell in 2005 with the Buick Championship. Watson, who first played at TPC River Highlands in 2006, won the Travelers in a 2010 playoff, and he committed to the 2012 event back in February. The tears of joy that fell when Bubba dropped his putt to win the Masters last Sunday weren't restricted to Bubba. Easter was a glorious day for the Travelers. They didn't just get a major winner. They got one of the major story lines in sports.

And the drunken sailors, played by Lakeetha Blakeney and Adam Flores, are the best I've ever seen. They're genuine crowd-pleasers, just as they must have been in Shakespeare's day. There's nothing arch about these two human noise machines, who could hang around with Beavis and Butt-Head.
Critics rightly worry that this model could end up repeating the mistakes of the quasi-public California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, which voters approved in 2004. Undoubtedly, it will take constant vigilance to prevent a "Son of Stem Cell," with big money decisions being made with little transparency and a sizable potential for conflicts. There are also real worries, despite the wording of Prop. 29, that too much of the money raised by the tobacco tax could flow to researchers in other states.

Carrillo said the recently elected city attorney was insensitive and lacked compassion to react that way. "He's like a 15-year-old at a football game, displaying adolescent hubris, celebrating an action that took the life of a baby.

“The current process presents real obstacles for the victim that are unfair,” said state Sen.

After the show, he says, “I just let off steam. I didn’t physically hurt anyone, I didn’t try to hurt anyone, I just wanted to release the anger that I had inside me because I felt that I worked so hard for this music and I felt like people kept just trying to take it away from me.” Smashing a window is letting off steam?

He was kicked in his left shin during that game. Although Bryant managed to play the next four games, the pain eventually became so much worse that the Lakers' training staff forced him to miss seven games so that it would fully heal. The Lakers then secured the Western Conference's No. 3 seeding in time to rest Bryant for the season finale last week against Sacramento. Since then, Bryant has helped lead the Lakers to a 2-0 first-round series lead over the Denver Nuggets by averaging 34.5 points a game on 49.1% shooting.

Each main course comes with two sides. Creamed spinach was fine, lightly laced with cream and scented with nutmeg, and I enjoyed the flavor of the creamy-tanginess of the au gratin potatoes, although the chunks were so irregular that some had disintegrated into pablum and a few were starchy and underdone. Carrots and onions tasted like you'd find around an old-fashioned pot roast, and the broccoli needed more contact with heat so the stalks weren't so crunchy.

The first union vote of "no confidence" in mid-February was an expression of resentment regarding tight county budgets and the partial repeal of the county's binding arbitration law.
