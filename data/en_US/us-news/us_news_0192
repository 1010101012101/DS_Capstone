Anastasia, as she "struggles" with the implications of her racy new love life, defers consistently to what she calls her "inner goddess."

In some respects, the Newmark Theatre should be an ideal venue for Portland Opera's latest production, Philip Glass's "Galileo Galilei," which opened Friday night. A far more intimate space than the Keller Auditorium, where the company presents its mainstage shows, it's better suited to the chamber scale of the piece, the smaller voices of the young Portland Opera Studio Artists in the cast and the lean, 16-member orchestra. On top of all that, the open-dome structure in the center of the ceiling suggests an observatory -- perfect for an opera about the legendary astronomer.

That Detroit is standing still, petrified by where it is, unsure of where to go. It met a fork in the road and went straight, to borrow a line from Jay-Z. That Detroit is in Wayne County, where a third of all state recipients of cash and food assistance live. The unemployment rate in that Detroit is still near 19%. That Detroit is in the throes of a financial crisis that its leaders have seen not as a fight to save the city but as a fight for power.
“This is to the person who feels that the judge beating his daughter with a belt was right. When you commit an act of violence on another adult, it is called assault, battery, or both, and can be punishable with fines and even jail time. The same should hold true if you touch a child. You, sir or madam, would not like to be beat with a belt or switch. Why? Because you are an adult now? The only reason parents utilize corporal punishment on their children is because they lack the education, patience and knowledge to deal (with) a child in an intelligent and mature manner. Our criminal justice system convicts any parent who lays their hands on a young child for assault and battery.”
Rub also modified the design for the museum's future central atrium by having Vinoly design a big, east-west mezzanine walkway for the north side of the space. It will connect two north-south walkways on the east and west, imparting a clarity of circulation that should be truly extraordinary.

What not to buy. Holiday season travel publications are full of travel gadget gift suggestions -- many electronic. Despite heavy promotions, I hesitate to recommend them. All the tech-minded travelers I know have fixed ideas about exactly what they want in electronics, cameras, and such: Unless you're filling a known "order," you could go seriously wrong. And many such items appear to be designed with the aim of looking cute in a display ad or a store rather than being truly useful. Even low-tech "travel store" gadgets are risky: Most travelers probably already have what they need and don't need yet another voltage converter, travel alarm clock, or neck pillow.
CLEVELAND  Five men, at least three of them anarchists, plotted to blow up a bridge near Cleveland, but there was no danger to the public because the explosives were inoperable and were controlled by an undercover FBI employee, the agency said Tuesday in announcing the arrests.

PCC, which enrolled 43,400 students this spring, was among the first in Oregon to ban tobacco in fall 2009. Before that, students could smoke in designated areas, but many students complained of walking by huddled smokers, and smoke drifted into air conditioning ducts, said spokesman Dana Haynes. After the ban, smokers lit up in the surrounding neighborhoods or woods. But neighbors complained, so the Sylvania campus designated four gravel smoking areas with waist-high urns for cigarette butts.

But if you're looking for someone to blame today, point the finger at the black and red pinwheel first. Portland had this game and let it get away. To start the second half, the Blazers outscored the Mavericks 20-0 in the paint. Then, in the final five minutes, up by four points, the Blazers stopped attacking, and dunking, and racing, and went into a tentative trance.

Razieh hopes to turn her duties over to Hodjat, but complications arise, so she keeps coming for a few days. The couple are desperate for money, and someone needs to do the job. But one day Nader comes home early and his father is alone, unconscious on the floor, his hand tied to the bed. Razieh and her daughter are nowhere to be found. Nader revives his father, but when Razieh returns, Nader and she have a disagreement, which will eventually lead to a murder charge (though not in a way you might expect). You realize, as all of the principals appear before a weary judge -- who seems to want to just get on to the next case -- that Farhadi has been peppering the film with clues along the way.

All are expected to plead not guilty.

As an adult, I've found/ it is the memory of Yosemite in summer that draws me to her, like the savoring of a first love. For me — and, I suspect, for others, Yosemite meant freedom from school, from work, from the constraints of the city or the monotony of the country. It meant nature and animals and a moon so milky white that it seemed a dream. It meant family and fresh air and the time to pause and reflect on a state that sometimes seemed less than golden.

I finished everything at that meal, and then turned to the desserts (all $7), which are slightly easier to give up than the savory courses.

Peter Bridge: Opening scene a tad slow and Almaviva had not yet found his voice. However, thereafter, the show was enormously entertaining. Figaro proved himself a winner from his first appearance, both as a singer and as an actor. Rosina was charming, and offered a lovely, precise, and very musical voice. Dr. Bartolo was well cast, and Don Basilio showed surprising power. Almaviva saved himself - as the show went on, he got stronger and stronger, and showier and showier. As the opera neared its end I came to the conclusion that this was an unusually musical "Barber" - the voices blended beautifully, the duets and trios were charming, and the characters were played with humor but were not over-the-top. "Barber" is almost always entertaining, but this production had more charm, subtlety, and depth than most. Well done, San Diego Opera!

The Blazers are clinging to sixth place in the Western Conference playoff race with two games remaining. Two games separate the second seed from the fourth seed and three games separate the fifth seed from the eighth seed. One quarter, even one possession, over the final two games can make the difference between facing the Dallas Mavericks or the two-time reigning champion Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the playoffs. And a person you've probably never heard of -- Larry Greer -- might just end up being the person who cements the Blazers' playoff fate.

Hey, Hoynsie: The Indians obviously have a need for an impact bat, preferably in the outfield. If they are open and willing to use the trade market, as they said they are, wouldn't Chris Perez be the most likely trading chip? They traded away their top pitching prospects for Ubaldo Jimenez, and short of Lonnie Chisenhall (who doesn't make sense in a deal for offense anyway), they don't have any big-league ready young players to offer. They have depth in the bullpen and Perez would probably stir up the market. If they don't use Perez in a deal, I'm not sure the Indians would have enough to offer in exchange for a bat that would even matter. -- Leslie Marchak, Sagamore Hills

Coal demand is projected to rebound somewhat in 2013, and no matter how cheap natural gas remains, there's only so much coal gas can displace in coming years.

Syun Izakaya remains a little slice of Japan in a quiet corner of downtown Hillsboro. From the bamboo decor to the bar of hyper-fresh raw fish and multiple bottles of sake, this is one of the most authentic sushi spots in the area. Raw fish is the star here, and it's good as sashimi, in an assorted Chirashi bowl with rice, or in the various sushi rolls. The massive menu features plenty of options, from inventive appetizers such as spicy salmon-stuffed mushrooms to traditional favorites including baked hamachi (yellowtail) collar, which features some of the most tender bits on the fish.

A lot of people are saying that Clinton's rough treatment and (as it now looks) failure to win the nomination will discourage other women from running for the presidency. I doubt that. Politicians are pretty thick skinned. Clinton has shown that a woman can be a mainstream, non-symbolic candidate of a major party -- she can raise tons of money, run a professional campaign, get lots of votes from men as well as benefit from the female side of the gender gap, and come this close to winning. That said, the misogyny her candidacy has revealed in the national psyche, like the racism Obama's candidacy has laid bare, is truly depressing. Next time someone uses the word "post-feminist," I think I'll dangle them out the window by their ankles until they promise to read Susan Faludi's "Backlash" all the way through.

A. Well, everything is emotion and personality, and you’ve got to get that in, whether it’s a comic strip or a movie or whatever you’ve got. It’s drama, and the more dramatic you can make it, the better. (The artist) Jack Kirby, the great thing about him was, every panel was dramatic.

That’s what you try to do in comics, in movies, in life — be interesting.

Romney has said that part of the cost would be offset through faster economic growth. The rest would come by eliminating selected tax breaks, deductions and loopholes. He hasn't disclosed which of those might be on the chopping block, however. Tackling any of them is politically dicey because it means forcing some taxpayers to fork over more of their dough. But the fewer people who are affected, the smaller the impact on the budget.

The last time lawmakers made significant changes to Social Security was in 1983, when they raised payroll taxes and gradually increased the retirement age. Those changes were made not just to solve a near-term funding crisis but also to gird the system for the baby boom generation's retirement. By the mid-1990s, however, it became clear that the changes had not gone far enough, and the program was projected to run short of cash before the last of the boomers is off the books.

No doubt, much of Romneys shifting owes to the nature of the GOP primary, which has been dominated by the partys furthest right elements. To compete with stauncher conservatives of lesser achievement and stature, Romney has essentially played down to their level. He is chest-beating and straining to prove his ideological bona fides (recently, he called himself severely conservative), rather than focusing on the nuanced, sophisticated strength of his record.

Cost aside, it also is difficult to measure whether Arizona's private prisons are any more secure than state prisons. Escapes are relatively rare. Including the Kingman breakout, in the past 10 years there have been 25 incidents involving 28 inmates from public and private prisons. Of those, 17 escapees were minimum-security inmates who walked away from work crews outside prison walls; all but two were recaptured in short order.

SpearIt (his professional name) and his wife, Vishakha, moved to St. Louis a little more than a year ago after a decade in California. They had never used a baby sitter or nanny for their young children, and as a professor, SpearIt had the flexibility to spend a lot of time at home with the babies. The kids had always been with us, he said. Around the time their eldest would be starting preschool, they decided it would be better to home-school because of Vishakha's background in education. They also thought that there was no reason to separate from the kids at such an early age. Recently, an opportunity arose for their son to attend a language immersion charter school close to their home, so their 5-year-old son will be starting kindergarten at a school away from home this fall. Soon after, SpearIt will head back to the classroom as a law professor. He talked about preparing his son for the transition ahead.
