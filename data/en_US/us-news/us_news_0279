Can't imagine former Ducks quarterback Dennis Dixon riding in a car that was street racing, as Thomas was with teammate Eddie Pleasant in 2008. Can't see former linebacker Casey Matthews riding shotgun with Jeremiah Masoli as he was pulled over and cited for possession of marijuana, but Thomas was there in 2010. Can't believe the 80-plus current Ducks football players –– guys who do the right things every day and never get written about -- being subjected to a lecture from a state trooper who asked Thomas and Co., "Who's smoking the marijuana?" during the traffic stop.

Le Batard was turned off by "The Decision" TV special, but writes that's not the point.
Slade heard that it is not safe to run in mud without drilling holes in your shoes, so he does -- but only in his own shoes! Gretchen asked him why he didn’t drill her shoes too and his reasoning is that he didn’t know what shoes she was going to wear. (Because living together and driving to the event together affords no opportunity to ask!) As if that isn’t enough, Gretchen actually sprains her ankle in the mud. I know Slade says he’s not Gretchen’s manager, but he does book all of her appearances. I’m thinking at this point Gretchen would be better off with Kris Jenner as a manager. At least then Gretchen wouldn’t get hurt – all she would have to do is make a sex tape and let Kris call her fat every now and then.
Leave it to Stoli to make summer hotter and sweeter with its two new entries into the flavored vodka category. Stoli Hot with its jalapeno notes is sure 'nuff spicy and hot on the nose. Its aroma reminds me of my parents' garden of peppers when I was growing up. The flavor isn't as fiery as I thought it would be - thank goodness, really, because the nose is pretty intense - and when I tried it in a Bloody Mary, I found it toned itself down when mixed with the tomato juice.

Kretzu has assembled a promising cast, centered on one of his favorite performers, Susannah Mars, who plays the struggling mom, Diana. "I had a feeling that something would line up with her and this role and really open something up for her," Kretzu says. "And it's done that. I've never seen her work so hard.

-- If you have some big upfront payment and deposits, and haven't yet bought travel insurance, buy it as soon as you make your first payment -- and buy a policy that allows you to cancel for any reason. The typical trip-cancellation policy will not cover you if you're apprehensive about a strike that has been announced or expected. The only way to back out and conserve your payments is to buy a policy that allows you to cancel without having to worry about what is or is not a "covered reason" in a more conventional policy.

øThe Sonic's front seat area was unencumbered by the customary fat center console or intrusive door panel control pods.

In his one-on-one interview with Woodward, Obama explained his predecessor's failure to do critical strategic and contingency planning with some empathy: "Wars absorb so much energy on the part of any administration that even if people are doing an outstanding job, if they're in the middle of a war — particularly one that's going badly, as it was, obviously, for a three-year stretch there in Iraq — that's taking up a huge amount of energy on the part of everybody.

Sell the product: Giving vegetables cool names such as "X-Ray Vision Carrots" or "Broccoli Bits" has been shown to be effective in increasing consumption, Wansink says.

Well, now Halloween is coming, and that's something which really isn't made like it used to be, at least in many respects. Of course, kids still dress up in costumes and go trick-or-treating armed with corny jokes, so the event at its core is the same.

The toolkit will be available on the department's web site, http://www.vdh.state.va.us, by the end of January. "We're challenged to get the information to everyone," says Woolard.

It's one miserable virus when woken from a sound sleep. It usually starts with an itchy, tingly, painful patch of skin that erupts into a rash, usually on just one side of your body. Prevention is your goal, but if you get shingles despite being vaccinated, seek skilled care fast. It can be treated with antiviral drugs (acyclovir, valacyclovir) and painkillers.

(On how he evaluates a quarterback if linemen are missing blocks and receivers aren't doing their job)- "You bring up a very, very good point. I think when you're evaluating, every coach grades every player on every play. Then they come in and they meet and I'm not in those meetings. It's the way I use to do it and I'm sure Pat does it the same way. Then the head coach in essence is his own offensive coordinator. He's part of that. You look at the film and then you get the grades from your assistants. Mark Whipple as an example says Colt executed properly on this play, but the play wasn't successful, why wasn't it if it was a pass? Well, because he was pressured, this guy missed his block, this guy dropped the ball and then they get a grade. You get a grade and the point being as a coaching staff you must be brutally honest as to what happened and why it happened. You can't protect your player, you can't protect in your own mind yourself because all of a sudden if your player keeps being the guy that messes up then you're on thin ice, you can't do that. You just have to honest, that's the only way you have any chance of fixing anything and I think our guys do a good job of that. There's a pretty veteran presence in that offensive room. They will know if it's a quarterback error, what happened, did he do the best anyone could do, they'll know those things so while on the surface it might seem it might be a little bit tricky, it's not that tricky, they'll know."

During the mid to late 1960s, in a largely unsuccessful bid for major film stardom, Knotts made a series of family films that many connoisseurs now say were critically underappreciated at the time. These include "The Incredible Mr. Limpet" (1964), "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken" (1966) and "The Reluctant Astronaut" (1967). The latter two were made as part of a five-picture deal with Universal Pictures.

But it changed in the same way that a national poll of public opinion changed in not telephoning the same 1,000 people each time we are interested in tracking what people think about things.

Typically, the pharmacy sends a request to fill a prescription to an insurance company or pharmacy benefit manager. If approved, the pharmacy is notified how much money the insurer will pay for the medicine and the patient's co-pay obligation. If rejected, the pharmacy may need to contact the physician and ask the doctor's office to call the insurer for a "prior-authorization" or an "override." Some pharmacies and doctor's offices are too busy to make such calls.

Blanco This is how the drink is classically made, giving the margarita the bright, green, peppery freshness it's come to be known for. Generally, a highland tequila like Ocho Plata (40% ABV, $50) will give you more spicy, citrusy notes while a lowlands one like Partida Blanco (40% ABV, $50) will be crisper and fruitier. At around $20 a bottle, Espolón (40% ABV) is a steal.

Instructions: A day or two before serving, prepare the brine. In a container large enough to hold the brine plus the rib roast, combine the water, brown sugar and salt. Stir well until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Add in the bay leaves, fennel seeds, cloves, peppercorns and garlic, and stir to incorporate. Submerge the pork roast in the brine, weighting it down with a plate or pot lid if necessary. Refrigerate for 24-48 hours.

A: Agreed. But that's going to create the need to push hard likely to the end. And that's the tradeoff: fight to the finish of a grueling season, including a set of four games in five nights over the final week, or tinker with rotations and keep players fresh. Remember, the Heat were a No. 2 East seed last season and still made the NBA Finals.

While the show is very much an ensemble piece, the compelling psychological black hole in the middle of it all is Don Draper. He's slick, smooth, drinks too much, is tortured, haunted and ultimately on the run from himself. His job, like his purpose in life, is to sell illusion. Back in the first season, when it was revealed that Draper was really Dick Whitman and that he'd assumed his current identity from a dead Korean War soldier, ad agency co-founder Bert Cooper (Robert Morse) simply shrugged it off. Truth, it seemed, was a cheap commodity.

Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is now a teenager. When we are reunited with him, he is playing with his wand beneath the covers, but that's about as far as the sexual innuendo goes. His hormones are expressing themselves in hostility toward the Dursleys, the unmagical relatives with whom he must spend his summers. After a houseguest insults the memory of Harry's dead parents, the young wizard puts a cork in the windbag -- in a gross-out effect that's reminiscent of "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" -- and packs his bags to leave.

The slice into Cal Grants that lawmakers rejected — not for the first time — is the largest chunk of Brown's proposed 3.6% reduction in higher education funding for the next fiscal year. Starting in the 2013-14 budget, the governor wants to increase higher education money by 4% each year for three years. That would mean more for UC and CSU than in the current budget, though less than before steep cuts started in 2007.

A dozen or so cafe tables, scattered in front of more standard seating, set a more informal atmosphere and brought viewers within inches of the performers. It's got to be a little disquieting to dance the high-octane "Tarantella" that near to your audience, but Hiromi Yamazaki and Robert Dekkers found just the right amount of bounce-and-go mixed with genuine warmth to put together a terrific performance. Expertly staged by Oregon Ballet Theatre director Christopher Stowell and Diablo artistic director Lauren Jonas, this delightful little duet to the music of Louis Gottschalk - performed to recorded music here - is chock-full of deceptively tricky and yet fluffy-looking moments that Dekkers and Yamazaki tossed off with ease. Dekkers had just the right kind of lively, clean jumps and pliant ballon for this kind of piece, while Yamazaki added a flirty joie de vivre.

"Battle for Brooklyn" teaches about tenacity, access and, most of all, endurance. Co-directors Michael Galinsky and Suki Hawley spent eight years chronicling a sorry American saga: the fight between residents and developers over a massive real-estate project in Brooklyn's Prospect Heights neighborhood.

The 5'7, 175-pound forward has played 26 NHL games, posting nine points (five goals, four assists).

Beltran has as many at-bats with runners in scoring position in the past five games than he had in the first two weeks of games. Of course that's a product of being moved to the middle of the order. And the reason he was moved to the middle of the order is the same as the reason the Cardinals have been searching for offense in the past week. Berkman and Jay's absence saps the lineup of two key contributors -- Jay's .391 OBP is the third-highest among regulars and Berkman's presence extended beyond his production (zero homers, 2 RBIs).

We still live in the land of the free and home of the brave. While I would much prefer Rush Limbaugh to close up and go home, his voice of hate is how I teach my children to understand the difference between sane and stupid. I support the right of stupid idiots in which this country seems to be full of, to say stupid things. If I recall freedom of speech is still a basic freedom. By eliminating from public view his insane comments, we only force it underground. I like knowing where he is and have the ability to point at his ignorance. Some members of our family lived through the holocaust, others died in concentration camps. My father served 4 years hopping islands and fighting during WW2. This was done for our country to be free, so people can enjoy the rights that are so dear to us all. This my friend includes your point of view. I ask you to respect mine. My goal is to see our 100 employees have a roof over their heads, food on their table and good schools for their children. We both have more important things to do than argue over traffic reports. Don't insult me by suggesting we support Rush Limbaugh because of traffic reports.

Zetterberg echoed his teammates when he said he thought the Wings "had a good enough team to do some damage." But when the Wings faced elimination Friday, they responded with their worst game of the series.

No documentary's objective. To pervert Jean-Luc Godard's axiom, it's not only truth 24 times a second it's lying 24 times a second. But having said that, what are we in the service of in these shows? Are we wanting to illuminate the plight of migrant workers in California, as Harvest of Shame did? Or do you wish to know the bust size of Khloe Kardashian? Do you need to watch another year of one pretty thing trying to choose among a bunch of other pretty things, becoming excuses to elevate people to stature that they don't deserve?
Cheney waited nearly two years for the transplant. His lifelong history of heart disease includes five heart attacks, with the first one striking him at age 37 and the most recent one in 2010.
EcoBoost adds about $2,000 to the price of a similarly equipped Limited version of the Taurus sedan, a fairly small price premium for a whopping 39 percent increase in power.

"I don't think many young people have seen 'Chariots of Fire,' " he said. "And that is one great reason why Fox are doing this and BFI are supporting it. They are hoping to get a younger generation interested in a film which expresses issues such as achievement, endeavor and standing up for one's own personal beliefs."
While La Russa's moves worked, Washington was not as fortunate. In the seventh, after a single by Cruz and a walk by Napoli, Rzepczynski replaced Salas to face lefty David Murphy.

Obviously, you never know, but he's working his tail off and he is engaged and that's all you can ask for during this period." The Lakers have only squandered one 2-0 series lead, losing to the Phoenix Suns in 1993.

Comment: Top-2 talent. Washington Redskins moved up four spots to No. 2 in trade with St. Louis because they want RG3. Followed up terrific combine (even though he didn't throw) with five-star pro day. Elite athlete with huge arm. Velocity allows him to fit balls into tight spaces. Excellent touch on deep balls. Can escape the pocket and be creative when play breaks down. Even though he has track speed and is dangerous in open space, RG3 rarely leaves pocket too early. Highly intelligent, big personality, natural leader. 2011: Heisman Trophy, 4,293 passing yards, 37 TD, 6 int.

"War Horse" is based upon a stage play and while cynics will scoff at the plot's far-fetched coincidences and at some of Joey's more remarkable acts of heroism, the movie's emotional weight and sweeping scope trump any and all shortcomings.
The CRC gym was a critical project, athletic staffers say, to keep the school relative and competitive. Recruiting high school athletes without facilities is a brutal chore. A school would never bid to host a state championship without quality facilities.
Mr. Poirier's nimble screenplay offers Lawrence the prospect of midlife passion, even love, but, here again, nothing is easy. Sarah Jessica Parker's physician, Janet -- another lovely, rueful performance -- is a worthy match for the professor when it comes to flee-or-fight responses; if happiness threatens, she bolts. Then there's Ellen Page's Vanessa, blessed with something of the same verbal brilliance that Ms. Page pulled off so blithely in "Juno," but doomed to perform for her father ever more precociously unless someone can break the spell. In a script studded with zingers, the best exchange is the simplest. "I don't think you're very happy, Vanessa," Lawrence says. "Well, you're not happy, and you're my role model," Vanessa replies. "Smart People" made me happy from start to finish.
The final challenge was to assemble 120 empanadas, and then “search the grounds on foot” for Phil. The sisters wanted to be the comeback kids on this challenge, and they worked efficiently. It was them versus the Jersey boys at the end, and the sisters finished first.

That information like this was not widely known until recently was, in part, a testament to the effectiveness of the global warming alarmists in suppressing the publication of dissenting opinion.

SC: The fact that you've lived in Bali for many years gives you an advantage over the scholar going there for the first time to search for Rimbaud. You understand the culture on a more intimate level and that probably helps in speculating about what was realistically possible for Rimbaud.

Comic books are at the top of that list. Thanks to the new iPad's Retina display and true colors, the experience of reading a comic book on a mobile device is just as good as reading it on dead treeware. Despite the fact that the screen is slightly smaller than a printed comics page, there's more than enough detail on the screen for easy reading. I never felt the need to pinch and zoom and scroll around the page, as I do with previous-generation iPads. Furthermore, the backlit display does full justice to the artwork from top to bottom and left to right.

It stretches back through time, to Jesse Katz's Little League days more than 30 years ago at Wallace Park in Northwest Portland, when his mother was shedding what he calls her "groovy hausfrau skin" and beginning her political odyssey as a volunteer for Bobby Kennedy's presidential campaign. Vera Katz, her son writes, picketed outside the all-male City Club meetings at the Benson Hotel for two years, "occasionally waving a rolling pin or donning a colander as a helmet."

Some big corporations are enjoying record profits precisely because they've kept a tight lid on hiring.
