I do know, too, that your typical groundbreaking does not hold such great emotion. There was the mayor saying he lived in and worked for public housing, and he knows the stigma of it. "We've arrived at a moment, and we will never be able to arrive at another like it again," Mayor Michael Hancock said. "What you are doing is touching generations of people you and I will never meet.

During the whole two-hour period, the birthday boy's parents did not so much as acknowledge our presence.

Ohio wants to keep this in the high 60s or low 70s.

U.S. 60 once ran down Main Street, but when the highway designation was transferred to a modern freeway 2 miles to the south, it doomed places such as the Buckhorn Baths, now considered the most endangered example of motor-court hotels in the nation.

I did appreciate the crisp cannoli ($8) with toffee, ricotta and almonds; and the cool butterscotch semifreddo with strategically placed kernels of caramel corn and a bourbon sauce. And few chocolate desserts can compete with the chocolate caramel tart ($9) that was a crunchy base of praline, with rich layers of caramel, chocolate, a sprinkling of sea salt and a puff of whipped cream; I barely made a dent in it, but took the rest home for a next-day treat.

Egypt has been plagued by sporadic bouts of deadly violence since the ouster of longtime authoritarian leader Hosni Mubarak last year, but Wednesday's killings took on added significance, coming just three weeks ahead of the presidential election. The killings also provided opponents of the military with more evidence the generals who took over from Mubarak are badly bungling the shift to democratic rule and acting much like their former mentor.

While filling Pickett's shoes is an enormous task, finding someone who can approach his commitment is even more unlikely. Before coming to California State University, Sacramento, in 1980, Pickett created complementary theater companies in Salinas and Gilroy while teaching part time at community colleges near each town. He had worked with Valdez's influential El Teatro Campesino in San Juan Bautista and was impassioned by the power of political theater.

I generally avoid cannelloni ($16.50) because I find the pasta mushy and undistinguished, so I ordered it as a test - and it caused me to rethink my prejudices.

The rise in violence frustrates child advocates, who call it the latest symptom of long-standing problems in Maryland's juvenile justice system. Youths spend months in detention centers waiting to be placed in treatment programs, a process that should take weeks. Some facilities are at nearly twice their capacity, and sometimes the young inmates resort to violence. And the staff, stressed by mandatory overtime hours, are fleeing for higher-paying jobs in the adult justice system, leaving inexperienced staff to deal with angry teens.

This materialistic ethos emphasizes reducing inequality instead of expanding opportunity. Its policy prescriptions begin (and sometimes end) with raising taxes on the rich. This makes you feel better if you detest all the greed-heads who went into finance. It does nothing to address those social factors, like family breakdown, that help explain why American skills have not kept up with technological change.
Clear Channel began airing on March 5 a 45-part series called "Diverse LA," 9 a.m. to noon on KTLK/1150 AM. The series replaced Thom Hartman and grew out of sister station KFI/640 AM's response to the concerns of a black activist group on workplace diversity, both on and off air. The concerns stemmed from disparaging comments made about Whitney Houston shortly after her death by KFI personalities John & Ken.

But they're admittedly very plush, so much so that I've been tempted to curl up for the day. Interestingly, most ocean-view rooms don't have a fireplace, but anyone — guest or no — can head down to the waterfront deck, which offers heat lamps and two fire pits (lit later in the day) as well as drinks and appetizers. In the evening, cocktails and occasional live music await by the large fireplace in the C Lounge.

Williams (2-1) threw 109 pitches, striking out six and retiring 18 of his last 19 batters to finish in an economical 2 hours, 10 minutes. It was his third complete game in 81 career starts. His other shutout was on June 27, 2003 with the Giants, a seven-hitter against the Oakland Athletics at San Francisco in his sixth big league start.
Lawson, who was 11-of-17 from the field, also took the challenge of simply being better. In Game 1, the Lakers forced him to spots on the floor that severely impaired his impact — namely, away from the rim. Los Angeles defenders also sat on his right hand, forcing him to do more going left, which right now isn't consistently a strong suit for him. He had to figure out ways to get back to his right hand.
Was there anything unique about the play when Roethlisberger got sacked by Scott Paxson and Brian Schaefering? “He got sacked by a couple of guys and that happens a lot.

Anybody can do it to you and guys are really at risk for injury anytime they’re out there playing, especially quarterbacks in the pocket.”

The new concerto is "Stumble to Grace," composed by Steven Mackey. "I wrote it knowing it would be premiered by a soloist-conductor team," Mackey says. Usually, he notes, "the soloist just has an hour meeting with the conductor before the performance," which doesn't leave a lot of time for exploring nuance. "Writing for David and Orli together allowed me to try some things: at one point, Orli is playing in (one rhythm) while David and the orchestra are going against every fiber of her being."
A group of evangelical Protestants worked successfully to oppose the watering down of the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and mounted a headline-catching campaign several years ago for higher-mileage cars by asking, "What Would Jesus Drive?"

Murray State: The Racers are the No. 6 seed in the West and aren't a huge upset pick, especially because they might just be a better team than No. 3 Marquette, the team they should beat to reach the Sweet 16. From there, expect their great 3-point shooting to just scare No. 2 Missouri, but the Racers could do more than that.

My immediate inclination was that my mother was dehydrated. She must not be drinking enough water, and that was causing her to be confused.

On the minus side, Santorum's late emergence as a more conservative alternative to Romney didn't seem to make Romney a more compelling candidate. By the time Santorum surged past a struggling Gingrich, the debates were over. The race was squarely in the name-calling phase, with Romney and his surrogates challenging Santorum's conservative credentials (because he supported pork-barrel projects and -- gasp! -- voted to raise the debt ceiling), and Santorum blasting Romney for supporting an individual mandate to buy health insurance in Massachusetts and for allegedly lacking a vision for the country.

Pietz and Foizey pack plenty of goofy heart into love songs like "I'm Infected" and "Girl, Can I Kiss You?" (which is not as innocent as it sounds).

Their 13-1 romp past the Brewers dropped Gallardo to 1-9 with a hideous 7.05 career earned run against them.

Thus a legislature's judgment that a measure is desirable does not relieve a court of the duty to judge whether it is constitutional.

LOCAL TRANSPORTATION. Avoid taxis as much as you can. Instead, transport systems in many of the world's major cities sell unlimited-ride daily, several-day, or weekly passes.

You can even hop on a bus or subway for just a stop or two.

Future of BCS: The future of college football's postseason model might have cleared a bit according to documents obtained by USA Today last week. According to the website, officials are considering four options to replace the current Bowl Championship Series. One option being considered is a "plus-one" format that would involve selecting two teams to meet for the national title following the completion of the bowl season. Another is a four-team playoff that would involve the four highest-ranked teams at the end of the season meeting in semifinals. That is unless it involves the Big Ten or Pac-12 champion or both. In that case, those two teams would play in the Rose Bowl while the next two highest-ranked teams would play in the semis. Two teams from those three games would then meet in the national championship game.
