For the junior Neuheisel, who shares his dad's friendly demeanor, aw-shucks smile, set of narrow blue eyes, and head of thin blond locks, it's obviously a bit strange.
"I thought right away that edible education should be integrated into the curriculum, in the same way physical education came into schools," Waters told me in a telephone conversation on Friday.

"I have recently been studying fairy tales and their meanings in a Jungian fashion," says Anne Siems, who describes her style of painting as Magic Realism and draws influences from old masters, in particular from the late Renaissance to the latter part of the 19th century.

The disorder is also treated by specialists such as rheumatologists, who treat arthritis and related disorders; and neurologists, who treat nerve diseases.

Allied health professionals such as physical therapists may also help treat patients.

New York-based designer Patrik Ervell, who sells clothes under his own name, tried to find middle ground with new fabrics. For his fall 2009 collection, he made a blue denim jacket with a trim made from sheep hair woven to look like shearling. The material had been used for luxury teddy bears but rarely in clothing. "It's only after you try it on and feel it that you realize there's something different about it," Mr. Ervell says.

Among the goodies is brazo de reina, an egg-rich cake rolled around manjar, the gooey caramelized milk elsewhere known as dulce de leche. The dessert you should not miss (served only weekends) is the Berliner. A cousin of Italian zeppole, the burger bun-shaped, yeast-raised fried pastry — filled either with fluffy custard, fruit jam or manjar — is bliss incarnate.

Scott, 62, was born in the area, where his father worked as a chiropractor. He met Gale at college in Chico, where he earned a degree in public administration. They married and moved to Ridgecrest, where Scott hoped to get a job in local government, but his father was a city councilman and soon became the mayor, so an anti-nepotism law put the kibosh on that plan.

The Associated Press formula calculates an executive's total compensation during the last fiscal year by adding salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest the company pays on deferred compensation and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year. The AP formula does not count changes in the present value of pension benefits. That makes the AP total slightly different in most cases from the total reported by companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Finding the menus from the Titanic — first, second and third class — was fairly easy. They are among the artifacts that were recovered from the wreckage. Rather, it was making sense of the scant descriptions, such as "roast duckling, apple sauce," that was more complex, Lewis said. He cross-referenced the menu with other research, then came up with his interpretation of the meal.
To bring the dining and living areas together, the same fabric was used to cover the pair of French doors. Galvanized plumbing parts and copper tubing were made into curtain rods and mounted below the door trim headers. (This was a big hit with Glenn because it had an industrial look.)

"This is not a greedy bunch of people," said Teri Yamada, a professor of Asian studies. "It's not so much about salaries, but the quality of education being jeopardized by the relentless cuts.

Even after nearly three years, getting a seat at this small Italian restaurant hasn't gotten any easier. While half the restaurant is open for walk-ins, if you don't get at the door well before the 5:30 p.m. opening, you're in for a long wait. However, people don't seem to mind once they fork into Thomas McNaughton's pasta with smoked duck and fresh horseradish or his classic take on the Piedmontese agnolotti dal plin. He also offers great pizza, a couple of main courses and some of the best Italian-inspired desserts in the city. The casual interior has a soulful quality, with stained-glass accents from the still-missed Myth, rustic ceiling beams and handsome walnut tables.

Is there any field where it's more square to insist on hiring legal workers than nannying? If so, I haven't heard of it. Chalk it up to my German-Jewish (a k a rule-following) roots, my husband's being a lawyer or our desire to be good examples for our daughter, but we never considered hiring someone who wasn't legal. In fact, that has been one of our primary litmus tests, eliminating many candidates other families would have gladly hired.

P Steve Weatherford. NBC just barely missed a great moment after his punt in the second half when he slapped the Pats’ Matthew Slater on his derriere right after the ball was downed. Slater, to my surprise, didn’t do a thing. “I’m like a kid out there,” Weatherford said of his energy level in general. “It’s a game and that’s how I play it. When I’m able to have fun, I play well. I’ve had fun this entire year and I think it showed. … We’re enjoying the ride and that’s kind of an element I bring to the specialist’s group, that youthful joy of the game.” Yeah, that and consistency, which is why he’ll soon have a nice long-term deal to stay here.

False. Rescue breathing is crucial in near-drowning cases, when the heart stops because of a lack of oxygen. Begin rescue breaths at once, even while still in the water. Add chest compressions after reaching a boat or land, giving two breaths after every 30 chest compressions. The American Heart Association says it is acceptable to skip mouth-to-mouth breathing and focus on chest presses for sudden cardiac arrest caused by heart problems. In such cases -- unlike near-drownings -- the blood retains enough oxygen to supply vital organs until rescuers arrive to jolt the heart back to life.

"No, I was mad at the time. The stuff that came out, it seemed to me that was the press conference dealing with Colt's injury and I was mad. Some of the questions even by your standards -- and you guys never do this -- but some of the questions I was asked were a little bit on the line and I thought I was reasonable in my responses.

They're being dropped by the old - Betty White on TV Land's "Hot in Cleveland" - and the very young - Jane Levy's Tessa on ABC's "Suburgatory" - and in scripted and non-scripted shows alike. A recent episode of Bravo's new reality show "Shahs of Sunset" was titled "It's My Birthday, Bitches." Two of ABC's midseason comedies brazenly revolve around the word - "Don't Trust the B- In Apartment 23" and "GCB," which was originally titled "Good Christian Bitches." (Well, maybe not so brazenly. The network eventually decided the actual word was too incendiary for a broadcast audience.)
As rangers Mary Pat Doorley, Pam Machuga, Cindy Brewer and Cindy's husband, Jared, impressed on me, the uniform brings a sense of responsibility, too. Sure, a major part of that responsibility is to the visitors, but it seems to me that an even greater responsibility is to the park itself.

Trichet said that the 23-member rate-setting council made its interest rate decision by consensus, not by unanimity, suggesting there were voices calling for a cut -- voices that might gain the majority in coming weeks if signs of a downturn increase.
Shaw insists that the competition between Nunes and Nottingham remains a dead- heat and will continue throughout the spring and summer until one candidate emerges as the go-to guy come the 2012 season opener against San Jose State.

"The intensity, the smile, the infectious attitude, it carried over to all the other guys," said Humphries, who was shocked that Seau is now the eighth player from the 1994 Super Bowl team to die.
To begin with, waste-fired generation is not carbon neutral. It is carbon subtractive. Even opponents of the practice acknowledge that the carbon dioxide released in burning wood waste will eventually be released through the much slower process of decomposition. Yes, some of the carbon will be utilized by growing plants and much of the sulfur and nitrogen that create the additional pollutants cited in the article will be fixed in the soil or plants through various mechanisms. However, that decomposition will also create methane, a greenhouse gas with an impact from 10 to 100 times greater than that of the carbon dioxide molecule. More importantly, omitted from discussion was the fact that if the energy in the waste was not utilized, some other fuel source – likely natural gas – would be burned to produce the electricity generated by wood waste, creating even more CO2.

Sheridan H. Downey, the Democratic senator whom Douglas decided to challenge in the state primary, was an old Upton Sinclair supporter who'd gradually drifted rightward: He ultimately dropped out and endorsed a third candidate, the publisher of the Los Angeles Daily News. The Central Valley, which had been a New Deal stronghold, was split over complex land and water issues. Douglas managed to get into a spat with the building trades, a powerful part of the Democrat's labor base. The statewide Democratic ticket that year was headed by James Roosevelt, who was running for governor against Earl Warren, one of the most popular politicians in California history. Roosevelt, moreover, was shunned by the party's national establishment because he'd been part of a "dump Harry Truman" effort at the previous national convention.
Bill Gruzynski, who has traded in the Chicago markets since the 1970s, said that while high-frequency trading can be used fraudulently, so can any other trading system. And the markets have never been a level playing field.

The quarter is a simple race, a single lap around the track. The race's simplicity, however, belies the agony that awaits at the end of it. It is a race for only those brave enough to seek the depths of one's inner strength. The best, the most courageous, sprint for 300 meters and then hope the toil, resolve and momentum will somehow carry them through a final homestretch, a muscle-cramping, long burning hell.

Not even matching the worst start in franchise history has caused the Angels to waver from publicly backing their new first baseman.

This is hardly a revolutionary idea. Cities in Cuyahoga County have shared SWAT teams and emergency dispatch services. They've formed purchasing co-ops to buy road salt and other supplies.

First of all, I would like to thank Albert Pujols for his contributions to the Cardinals' success during his time here. But he must have been so focused on his game during his time here, he never fully realized what Cardinal Nation is all about.
Rip City will get the chance to evaluate the new-look Blazers up close and personal from Day One as the Blazers play seven of their first 10 games at the Rose Garden. The Blazers open with a three-game home stand that includes a back-to-back against the 76ers and Kings and a Dec. 29 matchup against former point guard Andre Miller and the Denver Nuggets.

Key has been an acquisition target on and off for the last 15 years. That's primarily because, with branches from Maine to Alaska, Key is large enough to be an attractive target but small enough to not be a powerhouse among banks.
Former Twins infielder and manager Frank Quilici was there, too. The Miracle League was a favorite cause of his late friend, Twins Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew. As he waved the players and their Century buddies around third base, Quilici never stopped smiling -- an inevitable side effect on a day that made baseball feel truly inclusive.
It has been speculated that the Broncos would take linebacker David Harris in lieu of a first-rounder, which comes as no surprise. He is an emerging star, signed through 2010, with the second-lowest salary among Jets starters. The Jets will not part with Harris.

Portland, however, is 10-17 on the road, including five losses to teams that currently have losing records.

He's caused us to go to sleep, a little, while he chases down history. And it's his own fault, sure. Phelps has been remarkable, and breathtaking, and he's become the best athletic story of Beijing 2008, but also, we're complicit the minute we stop understanding how dicey it gets when the world is gunning for you and your goggles are prone to slipping.

Regarding "The next bike city?" (Page B6, Saturday), I am all for those who prefer bicycling to autos. It's great exercise, good for the environment, etc. However, bicyclists who complain about how they are treated by car drivers only have themselves to blame in a lot of instances. On the pavement, bicycles are supposed to follow regular traffic rules. But most of the time, cyclists don't heed stop signs, traffic signals, etc.
Now, set the floor joists. Use 2-by-6 pressure-treated wood with the 5 1/2-inch side resting on the concrete. Use construction adhesive and concrete nails set with a .22-caliber concrete nail gun.

And the main cause for the not-yet-a-campaign meltdown? Kinder's alleged relationship with a former stripper in the 1990s, or maybe it was his want-to-be relationship. The extent of their connection, especially in more recent years, never really became clear. Which makes this even more interesting as some in the Republican party continue to stress social issues instead of focusing on more pressing economic, job-related challenges in the state.
Dikos: This carbohydrate-packed meal is great for stocking glycogen. I recommend this as a carbohydrate-loading option before big events such as marathons, ultra-marathons or half-Ironmans. However, this meal also works fantastic for everyday eating. The meal is low in fat and rich in flavor. The cooked zucchini and tomatoes are easy-to-digest vegetables. The addition of Parmesan cheese kicks the sodium content of the meal up, which is good to consider when carb loading for a warm, long event.
There's little chance this Congress will agree to many, or even any, of those suggestions. Tax increases seem particularly unlikely. But even if lawmakers were to adopt all of Obama's deficit-cutting measures, they wouldn't go far enough to set the budget on a path toward balance. Obama's proposals would stop the debt from growing faster than the economy eventually, but inexorably rising healthcare costs would make the respite temporary. All told, his proposal comes up about $2 trillion short of the savings his own deficit-reduction commission called for over 10 years. The economy may not be ready yet for a stiff dose of austerity, but the government needs a better plan for putting its fiscal house in order than Obama offered Monday.

I’m the starting quarterback. They brought me in this year to help get to the championship, as well as get back to the success the program is use to. So far, it’s been fun being back out on the field and just being able to run around knocking heads with other guys. It was almost a year and a half since I last wore football equipment and got to run around so the feeling of being able to do it all again has been a blast.

He said the government might be trying to classify the information, not because it's top secret, but to keep him and his group from using it for future endeavors.

Another difference: Opposite-sex spouses can leave each other unlimited assets without owing any estate tax. The break is called the "marital deduction," and it drives much of estate planning. Since the federal government doesn't recognize same-sex marriages, such assets could be taxed when they go to the surviving spouse—even if they were held in joint accounts, Ms. Pearl says. And if those assets remained upon the second spouse's death, they could be taxed again.

But sweet inoffensiveness is part of Martin’s mission.

"If you go through the litany of economic data, it is just not giving small businesses the confidence to hire, to expand," Merski says.

The first year or two is the roughest. There are lots of tears as parents struggle to find therapies and resources to help their child.
As a historian of those origins, I can tell you that there were dissenting voices back in the summer of 1776, most notably George Washington and John Adams, who regarded Jefferson's dream of pure self-government as a preposterous illusion. Washington even thought that we almost lost the war for independence because of the refusal of the states to provide sufficient support for the Continental Army.

The project was terminated in October 2010 by Gov. Chris Christie, fulfilling predictions by critics that he would divert the tunnel money to prop up the state’s nearly bankrupt Transportation Trust Fund for road and bridge repairs and transit projects and avoid the need to raise the state’s relatively low gas tax.

"Talking to (DeSmet coach Pat) Mahoney, he said when you had a feeling, that's when you know you have the right decision," said Neal, who said he came to the decision Wednesday. "Sitting down and talking to coach (Bob) Stoops, talking to the offensive coordinator and my position coach and talking to the players, they kept it straight forward.

The researchers and other experts aren't accusing restaurants and food companies of trying to deceive customers.

That "debris" would have to kick up really high as that bear is three and a half to four feet high on all fours. What if it has risen to its full standing height in the attack mode of six to nine feet? Third: Some have alluded to noise. Wow, now that is a good idea. Mostly, noise merely signals the presence of someone who could be its next meal. Blow a whistle, ring a bell, start up your chain saw, it is all the same. People taste yummy and are easy prey. Not all guns will deter a bear either. It takes a well placed shot to do the job, There are even very special guns made especially to defend against the grizzly.

The best way to get to know the communities I’ll be covering, I feel, is to first be a local consumer. So please tell me what eateries and shops I need to visit --nobody knows better than you!

But the petitioners' complaints about the contents of the flier CASA representatives are handing out — Delegate Smigiel called it "half truths and lies" and wondered, "How is that not voter suppression?" — are thin. The fliers are strongly opinionated and include a less than charitable description of the motives of those backing the petition drive, and they certainly don't acknowledge any of the counter-arguments. But they don't include information that is untrue.

Morton & Eden, in association with Sotheby's, will hold a 164-lot sale of Islamic coins on Monday. The auction will be headed by a gold dinar dating back to 708 A.D. that is expected to fetch £800,000-£1 million. The coin is believed to have been struck from gold produced from the Mine of the Commander of the Faithful, a legendary site northwest of Mecca.

It's counter-intuitive to think the Blues can escape this two-game sleeper hold and get a reversal, but it's not crazy. Because goaltending can make it happen. Hockey history is full of examples, from Terry Sawchuk to Billy Smith, from Glenn Hall to Roman Turek. Some have been Hall of Fame players, some a flash in the pads. But whether it was one entire playoff, one series, or one or two games, they were great.

With the exception of Jake's Famous Crawfish, or perhaps The London Grill and Genoa, it is hard to think of a more iconic eating establishment in the region than Nick's Italian Cafe in McMinnville.

First thought is the way Kyle Flood handles the media is quite refreshing. No filler, all information. You ask a question and he gives you an answer. You ask, "What do you think of the quarterbacks?" He says, "No one has pulled ahead yet, but both are starting to play at a high level." Flood already wins the award for most no nonsense Q & A. It's refreshing and I think gives fans the ability to buy in that much easier.
2008 Monkey Bay Sauvignon Blanc, New Zealand ($9-$11) - The color is silver yellow. The aroma offers hints of classic grapefruit that lead into a taste that is bright, pure grapefruit; tartness with richness. I like this for sipping, and it will certainly work with a handful of ice. 85 points
There are still far too many files and programs that I can't open or run on my iMac. And some of the Apple versions of Microsoft programs aren't yet up to snuff.
In fact, the Suite might be a pretty good classical starter piece for metalheads and others of that ilk. The second movement, entitled "The Evil God and the Dance of the Pagan Monsters," was put to use by Emerson, Lake and Palmer on an album. That one should appeal to the Goth crowd for its title alone, come to that.
"It's often called 'smell brain,'" says Marcia Pelchat, associate member at Philadelphia's Monell Chemical Senses Center. "Smell brain is also the emotion brain. And odor memories tend to be more emotional than other types of memories."
In his fifth Vegas restaurant, the talented Michael Mina does all kinds of fish in all kinds of ways: salt-baked, wood-grilled, cast-irongriddled, cedar-plank-smoked and ocean-water-poached. Paying homage to the rustic tradition of seafood preparation — lobster boils, clam bakes and campfire cookouts — but with a modern flair, Mina coaxes unbelievable flavors out of regional catches from the nation’s great rivers, lakes and oceans. Fresh and saltwater fish on the menu include Copper River salmon, Rhode Island summer flounder, Alaskan prawns and Great Lakes walleye. Signature dishes include the smoked salmon “BLT,” the laughing bird shrimp po’ boy, cornmeal-crusted trout and a mixed grill of razor clams, scallops and squid.

The third-round tilt between the Timbers and Sounders FC presents a rematch of last season's third-round matchup, in which Seattle claimed a 2-1 win before a sold-out crowd at PGE Park on its way to the 2009 U.S. Open Cup championship. The deep and spirited rivalry between Portland and Seattle dates back to 1975 as members of the North American Soccer League. The two sides battled through eight seasons (2001-08) as opponents in the USL First Division, and the rivalry will be renewed in 2011 when the Timbers join Sounders FC in MLS. In their most recent meeting, the Timbers defeated Sounders FC 1-0 in a Community Shield match March 11, 2010, at Qwest Field.

4. American Grafitti (1973) Bob Falfa: It would be a few more years before he hit it big, but Ford has a small-but-crucial role as the villainous stranger with the fast, sweet Chevy who's looking to challenge Big John Milner. George Lucas launched his directing career, and a 1950s nostalgia craze, with this underrated masterpiece.
In a small way, I could relate to stories you hear about rock stars who get so caught up performing and selling records, only to come back from tour finding themselves in financial trouble because money managers weren't on top of their game. Or the big-time lawyer that wins a major multimillion-dollar case, only to find that he can't pay his employees or vendors in the short term because a bank line of credit is tapped out.
Indeed, there are reasons to believe Pujols will become the player everyone expects him to be in Anaheim. He's getting used to a new team, a new league, a home stadium not built for the long ball, and a bunch of new pitchers he's never faced before. And he did have a similar power drought early last season, before finishing with 37 home runs and leading the Cardinals to a World Series win.
And if it had, I would have been against that as well.
But hands down, the best Voodoo doughnut is one that includes "dirty" in its dirty name. Looking like something dug from the garden and tasting like a super-rich Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, the doughnut has a top crammed with Oreo cookie shards. You'll want to have a frosty glass of milk nearby.
The facts: Masterson, Lowe and Jimenez throw a lot of ground balls. The grounders will increase if Hernandez rejoins the team. There are going to be errors if Lonnie Chisenhall starts at third and Kipnis at second. They're young players who have converted from other positions. Cabrera's range decreased last year at short in the second half.

Prosecutors say the verdict against Godinez validates their strategy to try each defendant separately, even though they called the killings a group effort to initiate a member into MS-13, a street gang with Central American roots.
More generally, Americans came to see that the war in Iraq had nothing to do with what they cared most about, which was protecting the United States against another terrorist attack. Indeed, the war in Afghanistan, which was a direct response to 9/11, was pushed aside as a priority. At one point, Bush declared of bin Laden: "I don't know where he is. You know, I just don't spend that much time on him ... to be honest with you."
The problem was our defense. We had Buddy Dyer and Rich Crotty in as our guards. And the Magic were able to drive straight to the public coffers.

During the nearly two-hour hearing in Trenton, the justices fired pointed questions at both sides, with the recession and state's own budget problems a factor in the debate.
"He made some big shots," Vianney coach Kevin Walsh said. "He had some nice passes. He was creating for his teammates. Rich is kind of the consummate point guard; he doesn't care if he scores or not.

The Humane Society of Missouri has planned a few specials this month.
McMillan told his team just that in the postgame locker room. Then, after McMillan departed, the locker room doors remained closed, long after the NBA-mandated 15-minute cooling off period had ended, and the players talked things over amongst themselves. No one was eager to divulge details of the chat, except to say the meeting was held in an effort to "figure things out" and reinforce McMillan's postgame message.

"Then we came back in game one of the regular season and we beat them 7-2.

A lanky, 6-foot-4-inch 58-year-old, with piercing blue eyes and a fondness for cycling, Mr. Williams prided himself on his deep data dives.

Jesse's Ghost by Frank Bergon (Heyday: 224 pp., $20) It's a short drive north from Los Angeles to California's San Joaquin ValleyCentral same time zone, same state, but you might as well be traveling to another planet. Central California is a place that has had its own heart torn out to feed the rest of the country — ranches and fields have long since been denuded and propped up with fertilizers and pesticides, and the history of labor — the pickers, ranch hands, farmhands from all over the world but mostly Mexico — is documented in articles and books. Frank Bergon finds beauty in the valley, and not through artifice. He sticks to his main character, Sonny, like glue; breathing in his body as he tells the story of how, decades ago, when he was 27, he shot his best friend, Jesse, over a woman. There is huge insight here into the lives of valley workers — the tools they use, what they eat for lunch, what they drink and how they fight and flirt. Also how they die, from malathion poisoning, or alcohol, or diabetes.
It is the sensitivity of oxytocin in its interaction with a range of other chemical messengers that helps to account for why human behavior is so infinitely complex—and why the bliss of the wedding day (and night) is often hard to maintain.

The high-stakes punishments of state tests are even more daunting than their dry emphasis on isolated skills and facts. Davis Elementary, where I teach, won awards from the state for its rising achievement for several years -- until last year, that is, when we could no longer meet the No Child Left Behind requirement that 10 percent more students pass the standardized tests yearly. Except for layoffs of most of our instructional assistants and the enrollment of some eager, intelligent new children who came directly from refugee camps with no previous knowledge of English, nothing has really changed at our school. Yet the emphasis on test scores that ignore the effects of poverty and the research on how long it takes to learn a new language changed our official status from a "champion school" to a school that has failed to meet "adequate yearly progress."

He was a Hall of Fame manager with youth on his side. But Herzog never took another managing job. He resisted the overtures.
