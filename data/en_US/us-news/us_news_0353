Staring at a face reflected in the gleaming surface of a new iPad, or hearing Siri's synthesized voice answer questions on an iPhone, it's easy to imagine that there's something more than just microchips and wires inside those smart machines. There isn't. But scientists envision a day when computing devices and their software will not only be as smart as the humans who designed them but also be able to upgrade themselves. Then what happens? At a recent and somewhat whimsical panel discussion in Austin, Texas, a trio of robotics experts disagreed on whether events are leading inexorably to a Hollywood-style battle between robots and their creators. But they raised an issue to grapple with today: whether humans should treat their increasingly lifelike machines humanely.

The story, however, remains underdeveloped. Krymov's adaptation is short on either evoking Paris or telling us much about the characters. Their background as refugees from the Bolshevik Revolution - the general was with the Western-supported White Russian forces - will mean little to those who don't know much about Russia's civil war.

Apportioning the vouchers is a difficult task. What's more, reintroducing ex-offenders into communities is a precarious undertaking that challenges housing officials and understandably leaves neighbors worried.

My initial, knee-jerk reaction to Xfinity Live! was this: I didn’t like the idea people would be lured to this district, this no-man’s land, this megaplex of “dining entertainment.” And not only because the people in the PBR Bar & Grill would soon be getting into their vehicles in the parking lot (where it costs $15 to park on game day). I also feared Xfinitiy Live! would lure people away from Center City and away from the great, unique, local restaurants and bars that make Philadelphia such a great city for dining and drinking.

Now and again, the eye is drawn to an exquisite object of utterly superior artistry, and one finds that it probably came from a nearby sedentary civilization. The 2,200-year-old gold Kargaly diadem found near Almaty is a case in point. Its intricate arabesques seem rooted in the delicate gold tracery of Han Chinese workshops. We know this because we have seen comparable things before in various museums. The bronze cauldrons could be Urartian or, for that matter, Chinese. The bronze incense trays show Achaemenid or Persian motifs. In fact, nothing here strikes one as utterly unprecedented; the show is not about the objects qua objects. Rather, they offer clues to a pivotal phase in our collective history that remains stubbornly crepuscular—a phase worth illuminating when you consider the impact it ultimately had on the world.

Andrea Spencer-Linzie, executive director of the New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Assault, said since 2010, state aid for rape crisis and prevention programs has fallen from $1.5 million to $900,000.

I'm sure my wife will be pleased to know that I never used the Girls Around Me app when it was available, but I have used Foursquare and Facebook's check-in features and, when you sign into Foursquare via Facebook, you have to go out of your way to change the default from Friends to Public.

It's very important that users know that the settings are "sticky," so if you post something publicly, your next post will also be public unless you change it to a more limited audience. The same is true with Google+.
So is the cargo area. The crossover's descending roofline and forward-arching hatch remove any chance of having serious cargo space, and the remaining area measures just 10.5 cubic feet.

Hatchbacks like the Fit and Versa are similarly voluminous. Even with the the Juke's 60/40-split rear seat folded down, its maximum cargo volume of 35.9 cubic feet trails the competition — in some cases by more than 10 cubic feet.

Nearly every state uses some sort of proportional system to award delegates, so even losing candidates can win a significant number. That makes it difficult for Romney to amass enough delegates to claim the nomination, but it also makes it hard for Santorum and Gingrich to catch him.
Right now, American manufacturers have a 20% cost differential disadvantage, and thats excluding labor costs, with our nine top trading partners. Why is it higher?

Because the base locks into place, you can use the stand upright or turn it around and use it as a wedge if you want to see the screen at lower angles (especially good for airplane seat-back trays).

Collateral damage from Linden's investigation: one dead, one in coma, one in a wheelchair, one facing prison.

"He had sort of been that anti-movie star. He did 'The Notebook,' and everyone was ready to crown him the next king, and then he sort of disappeared and did all these little indies (independent films)," Clooney said.

Federal Judge Susan Illston denied both motions, but ordered that the lawsuit be put on hold. At the defendant's request, Judge Illston issued a "stay" of the case while San Francisco pursues consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Federal agency tasked with the protection of endangered species. This will result, within a few months, in a "Biological Opinion" issued by FWS which will most likely determine the outcome of the trial and greatly influence the future of Sharp Park.

Just like that. The shame of this -- beyond the obvious -- is that the Wings' wonderful accomplishment in the regular season (98 points) will be obliterated by the bad taste of these playoffs.
