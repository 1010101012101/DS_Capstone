The league's reigning MVP, Rose tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee with about 1:20 left in Saturday's 103-91 victory — a huge blow for a team eyeing its first championship since the Michael Jordan era. Now, the Bulls will try to get by without their superstar, beginning Tuesday with Game 2 in Chicago, and there's no guarantee Rose will be ready for the start of next season. Rose is facing surgery at some point after the swelling goes down and he regains full range of motion, but ultimately, Forman expects a full recovery.

... I walked down to Union Square. It was filled with people -- hardly a square foot unoccupied. White people and negroes and Chinese and Japanese all mixed without prejudice -- one bench in the park might harbor all the chief races and no one seemed to be aware of it. One feeling seemed to possess all of them, and the expression was the same in every one's face -- a dull staring look of resigned despair -- a waiting for the end -- fear -- hopelessness. I never before saw people so cling to one another with a complete surrender of individuality.

So we’ll have to leave that for others to interpret."

The New York Post's Marc Berman reports that the NBA could turn to a 78-game schedule if the sides -- who, after all, seem pretty close despite Friday's breakdown -- can agree to a new deal by the end of this coming weekend. Owners, of course, will be driven to play as many games as possible to make up for lost income, so it should not be surprising that the league would want to turn the loss of 14 to 16 November games, per team, into four.

Hardest part of the job? Of course, the hardest part of the job is keeping up with all of the paperwork! Once you collect classwork and homework, it needs to be graded. Because there are so many components that go into teaching, most of the time there isn’t enough time to grade papers at school. Teachers bring home a lot of assignments and tests to grade. I don’t think people realize how much teachers work at home, not just at school. Our work day extends beyond the school day.

Perhaps the biggest blow — besides the awkward fact that the earth has warmed and cooled for millennia without the slightest help from puny mankind — was the release of the “Climategate” e-mails in 2009 and again last month. The correspondence from scientists at the University of East Anglia — the mother church of the movement — revealed an astonishing willingness to manipulate and falsify data in the interest of securing funding and advancing a political agenda.
The process turned out to be a lot more complicated than Schemmel's previous search for JMI.

In the end, Houston hired Tony Levine, who already was on the Houston payroll as an assistant coach. Schemmel knew Levine from the 1990s, when Schemmel was a staffer at the University of Minnesota and Levine was a Minnesota wide receiver. Schemmel's fee in the Houston search wasn't disclosed.

It's just that no one is sure where that confidence will come from.
For years now, I've been struck by the camaraderie among the elderly women, most of them widows, whose water aerobics class follows the morning lap-swim. Few knew one another before they joined this activity. Now they lunch together almost every month, celebrate birthdays together, check on one another if someone fails to attend a session or two, even raise money for a beloved staff member who lost her job in the recession.

Funny thing about James Mercer: Even when the Shins singer attempts to go big, he sounds as mannered as a butler in a British sitcom. He is saved from the dreaded NPR-rock bin by the strength of his melodies — always been some of the best and most acrobatic around. “Port of Morrow” is a Mercer solo album in everything but name: The original Shins, who gave the group more of its character than is generally acknowledged, are history, replaced by Greg Kurstin, a producer who has worked with everyone from Lily Allen to Ke$ha. Kurstin’s contributions consist mainly of slick, unremarkable guitar and bass and a few bubbly electronic intros. But once Mercer takes over and starts to sing in that reedy voice of his, all is forgiven: provisionally on careful country rockers “It’s Only Life” and “For a Fool,” and utterly on Kinks-style power-pop winners “Simple Song” and “No Way Down,” which bravely flirts with sociopolitical content. Mercer is smart enough to realize that the intimacy and guilelessness that made Shins debut “Oh! Inverted World” a bedsit classic is unrecoverable to him now, so he and Kurstin shoot for the clarity of follow-up “Chutes Too Narrow.” And when he shoots for something, more often than not he gets what he aims for. In a cheerful, polite way, of course.

The Rams have wasted a fortune on offensive linemen who were, at best, no more than average. (Jason Brown, Jacob Bell.) Before last season, Billy Devaney and Steve Spagnuolo decided that they had to do something big to upgrade their linebackers. So they signed three of them: Zach Diles, Ben Leber and Brady Poppinga. Diles was cut in camp. Leber was a complete waste of space, and to make matters worse, the Rams cut a promising young linebacker (Jabara Williams) to keep Leber. And Poppinga was just a guy in a long procession of just a bunch of guys at OLB for the Rams. The Rams in the recent past made it a habit to collect a bunch of stray wide receivers for no apparent reason. They have targeted safeties, any safeties, as long as that safety had a New Jersey Turnpike connection to Spags. (Meaning, he played for the Giants or the Eagles.) Lesson: it's not the position that they play; it's the quality of the player that mans the position. And the Rams are severely lacking in top-to-bottom quality.
"A person commits animal neglect two if they intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence fail to provide minimum care for an animal in such person's custody or control," she said. The first-degree charges can be brought if the above results in serious injury or death to the animal, she said.

The research needs to continue, said Robert Taylor, a gynecologic oncologist at Saint Barnabas Medical Center, but so far the results are "exciting."
So goofy Segel gets a physical scene when he suddenly has to remember he’s a big, potentially intimidating guy and chase down a rival. The sophisticated Blunt has a heated argument with her sister, all done in her best Cookie Monster voice. (That’s okay: Sis is impersonating Elmo at the time.)
“Our team is still working hard,” said Amy Ruiz, Adams’ spokeswoman. “At this point, it’s too soon to tell. There’s no indication one way or another, as far as we an tell, about where the OSC funding is going to land.”
Authorities have not identified the man but say he appears to be in his 30s.
As the film begins, Uriel is being inducted into the Israeli Academy of Sciences. He gives a humorous speech in which he thanks his father -- who could not look more miserable. What's worse, after the speech, while Uriel greets well-wishers, Eliezer steps outside for air. When he attempts to come back in, he's stopped by a guard, who puts him through an excruciatingly humiliating dance of identification, because he isn't wearing the right wristband. (Tight security is a recurring theme.)
They were fine. They knew they couldn't go down into the basement. We had moved some of their toys upstairs, so they could play upstairs. They were more interested in who was coming in and out of the house. And, they were interested in the big fans they used to dry it. Those fans kept blowing out our power, though.
But finally, it was Arizona. The Wildcats had an answer out of the locker room, rattling off a 20-5 run of their own, and made free throws down the stretch to pull out a 72-61 win over the Beavers. Arizona (23-10) will advance to play Cal or Colorado in Saturday’s final; the winner of that game will receive an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
Stars have been shilling their personal style for years though partnerships with major retailers, most recently Jennifer Lopez for Kohl's and Sofia Vergara for Sears. Now, the marketing arms of entertainment companies are getting in on the act. In December, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" costume designer Trish Summerville debuted a 30-piece collection -- heavy on the hoodies and aged leather pants -- at H&M, and it sold out in Los Angeles within minutes.
Newt Gingrich has found a way to stay in the news: by thinking out loud about quitting the GOP presidential race. In fact, talk of dropping out is about the only time the two-time front-runner makes news, which means he’s not likely to quit. It would mean giving up show business!
Edwardsville junior Emmonnie Henderson won the shot put (43-7 1/2) and the discus (160-5). She is the defending state champion in both events.

But a recent Harvard study does suggest that people who get a good night's rest find it easier to resist overeating -- especially when it comes to gorging on high-calorie foods such as ice cream, cheeseburgers or French fries.
There's a huge list of breads -- 25 to be exact -- including many that aren't often seen on local Indian menus. The chewy, layered paratha ($2) is delicious, but the poori ($2.95), a deep-fried hollow thin bread, was undercooked in the middle. Recently, Indian pizza was added to the encyclopedic menu, perhaps to draw in more of the casual Lower Haight crowd. We didn't get a chance to try the pizza because we were never given that menu.
"I'm reluctant to say anything definitive because this thing is close," said Jon Coney, spokesman for the campaign against Measure 26-108. Representatives for the "yes" effort said the race was too close to call.

All I can do in order to avoid 10-year-old-girl drama and wife-inflicted trauma is keep forking over money and hope the rabbit eventually gets healthy. I'll at least give it another year before I forget to latch its cage and it gets out in the yard and I have no control over what happens to the poor little thing.
A 2011 nationwide study by the Urban Institute found that foreclosure counseling nearly doubles chances a homeowner will receive a mortgage modification. The same study found that homeowners receiving counseling were more likely to remain current on their mortgages after curing a serious delinquency or foreclosure than those who did not.
The Chihuly Collection will take up about 11,000 of the 27,000 square feet of new space but how it all will be configured is undecided.

What most interested reviewers and readers was the way I recreated daily life in the Warsaw ghetto and my references to Jewish mysticism — to kabbalah. For instance, the high school kids I spoke to in Warsaw were very curious about my choice of a ghost — an "ibbur" — as the narrator of the book, and also about his use of anagrams. Readers did sometimes express one concern, however: that my portrayal of Poles may have been too negative. In "The Warsaw Anagrams," the narrator, Erik Cohen, is denounced by Polish Christian neighbors while in hiding and taken to a labor camp. Unfortunately, it was a fate that awaited many Jews in hiding. And yet the majority of Poles I spoke to seemed to truly believe that most of their parents and grandparents did their very best to protect their Jewish neighbors, which just isn't true. The most reliable estimates are that about five percent of the Polish population — one person in 20 — came to the aid of the country's Jews.

"I just don't know," Swarbrick told reporters about where this leaves Notre Dame in a league weakened by two high-profile members departing. "There's so much I don't know at this point, not the least of which is whether it's in fact a done deal. We'll learn much more in the next 24 or 48 hours and I'll have an opportunity to talk to our colleagues in the conference, our coaches, (President Fr. John) Jenkins and find out what it all means."
Alice Monaco and her family lived in North Beach, and when the time came to go, she bundled up her 4-month-old twin babies and a few possessions.

BILINGUALISM made easy! Ed Bayley, emeritus dean of journalism at Cal, is back from a stay in Brazil with a clipping from the Rio de Janeiro Daily, El Globo, which begins "Primeiro foi Gary Hart, por excessos sexuais, o que chamam aqui 'ants in the pants,' formigas nas calcas, a desistir da candidatura democrata a presidencia de EUS. Hart foi flagrado em adulteria multiplo pela imprensa." And all this time I'll bet you didn't know that you understood Portuguese.
Weeks hurt his groin while stealing third base in the fourth inning of Tuesday's game, and it bothered him the rest of the night. The timing was unfortunate for Weeks, who is off to a bad start but enjoyed one of his better offensive games Tuesday.

"We've hired people who have experience doing exactly what we want to do," said Dave Stockert, CEO of Post Properties and transportation chairman at the Metro Atlanta Chamber.
His idea was to use the devastation of postwar Berlin as the setting for a period piece involving murder, political intrigue, moral ambiguity and romance -- a film noir in the tradition of "Casablanca" or "The Third Man" -- and then to shoot it, with contemporary actors, in the visual and dramatic style of the period. Paul Attanasio's script was adapted from an estimable novel by Joseph Kanon. The stars are first-rate: George Clooney, Tobey Maguire and Cate Blanchett. And the technique is fascinating: black-and-white cinematography (on color stock with the color bleached out), soft images via lenses that now qualify as antiques, performances that echo the old film-noir acting style.
By virtue of Houston's loss Tuesday, the Trail Blazers clinched a playoff spot for the 29th time in the team's 41-year history. First-round opponent, game dates and times will be determined no later than April 13, after the conclusion of the NBA's regular season.

Meanwhile, he's enjoying his new baseball home. In batting practice recently, he carried a first baseman's mitt with his nickname "Burul" stitched on the side - he says it was a nickname for his father that was transferred to him; he says he doesn't know what it means. He's not officially working out at first, he says, though some in the game believe that will ultimately be his position. But sometimes he takes grounders there during batting practice "for fun," he says.
"When I was done with my work day, the freedom would just spring out of me. Sometimes I would stay in the studio for another eight hours, until the next morning, and just write songs for myself."

“I imagine a lot of military spouses don’t know what’s going on," he said. "They’re absolutely in the dark. All you’re trying to do is protect your family from things that happen to you when you’re over there. You wouldn`t want them to experience things we go through when we’re deployed.”
Of the four schnitzel entrees offered, I tried the St. Moritz schnitzel ($10.95), which was plate-size. The veal cutlet is stuffed with ham and Emmental cheese, breaded and fried until crispy and golden brown. The veal was tender and tasty, and the filling enhanced it even more.
Coach Pete DeBoer confirmed it will be the Russian's decision as to whether he is in the lineup Thursday night against the Philadelphia Flyers, so it appears Kovalchuk will indeed return rather than take a few more days and come back on Sunday.

"I believe we can create an American campaign of enormous proportions," Gingrich said.
The Times reports that Spears and her father have employed at least 17 lawyers and firms to keep her personal and business matters over the last 14 months. Many attorneys are still at work, so more legal fees are accruing and will submitted to a judge for approval later.

The Cavaliers acknowledge they are starting to get more requests for Irving, although nothing approaching the James years. This season has been a fresh start for a franchise that even a season ago endured its share of autopsies from the national media.
Hey, Tom: With the lack of athletic wings and a push to play younger players, where is Mychel Thompson? I'd rather watch him develop versus watching Omri Casspi clank brick, after brick, after brick, after brick. -- Jay Reed, Bedford Heights
Indeed, bin Laden insisted on seeing resumes of potential leaders, tried to impose a top-down management structure and demanded that subordinates stay within their roles. He entertained fundraising proposals like attacking drug runners to steal their money. He contemplated ways to improve news media coverage as his team soured on MSNBC but admired ABC News.
“He would’ve loved it,” Sullinger said. “He really would have. He would’ve been here.”
Their youngest child, Sidonie-Gabrielle, was born in 1873 and raised with encompassing love and surprising license. She was left free to roam in the woods, tag along after her two older brothers, play with a pack of friends in the ruined château at the top of the village and take down books by Honoré de Balzac and Émile Zola from the top shelves to be devoured with the imperfect understanding of a prepubescent girl.

Better to let states and schools cut through red tape, rather than encumber them with more of it. Several proposals winding through Congress right now would eliminate or combine existing programs to give states more flexibility to spend about $20 billion in federal "No Child" funds.
A father, mother and their thirteen children, living near Catonsville, recently lost most of their meager household goods in a fire that damaged their home. They are now forced to sleep in two beds, with insufficient covering.
As the industry's "drill, baby, drill!" mantra butts up against more science-based opposition, be on the lookout for this same layer ploy in every state. It's at once enticing and deceptive - but when that platter of mom and apple pie is inevitably served up, try to remember what the dish is made of.
"They have a tendency to slip, and as a result they can fall under another horse," said Nancy Dawn Ashway, who stables about 20 horses on her farm in St. Michaels and who travels around the country as a judge of horse shows. "The fact is it's unsafe for the animal no matter where they're going."
Shared Space presents an unlikely convergence of work by two artists who have shared a studio for four years.
Vesta's pockmarked surface could help tell why the pieces of the asteroid belt never became a planet. After Vesta formed, the gravity of newly formed Jupiter stopped further growth. The traditional view is that Jupiter's pull accelerated the Vesta-size asteroids so that they smashed themselves apart instead of coming together.
The 311 system should play no role in a campaign against boorish behavior, about which the city can do nothing, or in the shaming of alleged perverts. Criminal activity should be reported directly to the police at 911.
