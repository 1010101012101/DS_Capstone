Here's the thing about the wave of disaster that has tarnished the sport in recent months: None of it is new. Teams have offered cash bounties on the opposition since the 1950s, and probably much earlier. Decades of jarring collisions have left players crippled, demented or deceased before their time. What sets apart the reign of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is that aggressive steps are being taken to make the game safer - and that's long overdue. A somewhat milder sport won't affect its appeal in the slightest, for it will always be associated with courage and grace within the realm of combat.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the famed clinic says, “Regrettably, one of our employees violated strict confidentiality guidelines and laws by publically identifying patients in a media interview and by disclosing a privileged document.”

A: Sure. At the moment, my range of potential records goes from 11-1 to 7-5, with the game at Nebraska the common loss. But Nebraska is in the Legends Division, and those losses won't hurt as much. The Leaders Division should come down to games against the three best division foes -- at Illinois on Oct. 15, home against Wisconsin on Oct. 29 with Ohio State coming off a bye week, and home with Penn State on Nov. 19. Those games are all in the second half of the season, at which time the new quarterback, whomever it is, and Fickell should be much more comfortable. I think Ohio State has a shot to go 6-2 in the Big Ten and still win a Leaders Division tiebreaker. Then the new Big Ten title game in Indianapolis on Dec. 3 would be a tossup, assuming sanctions don't keep the Buckeyes from playing in it.
Demoff: "Mike Williams will be in charge of our personnel moving forward until we hire a new vice president of personnel or general manager. He's done an excellent job and I have great confidence in him. He'll lead our scouting efforts at the Senior Bowl for the all-star games and the Combine."

The sad part of "Soccer Made in St. Louis," of course, is that you know how it's going to end. Soccer would finally make it in America in the 1990s, but it would bypass St. Louis. Major League Soccer has expanded to 19 teams, none of which are in St. Louis. St. Louis University has won 10 NCAA titles, but none since 1973. The last U.S. World Cup team had no players from St. Louis. The last chapter of the book, dealing with the sport since 1980, is downright depressing, as St. Louis has a brief flirtation with indoor soccer, a failed attempt at getting an MLS team and a women's team that would shut down in the middle of its second season. You wouldn't be blamed for shutting the book after Southern Illinois Edwardsville wins the NCAA title in 1979.

“We are engaged in a culture shift here and I want teachers to understand that the main thrust of this work is to enable them to be better,” Cerf said. “The more they’d view something that would have a shame factor attached to it, the less willing, I think, they would be to work with us in an effective and fair system.”

In some cases, builders will keep a hand in their projects after the Games leave town.

Our suggestions? Restore sex-crimes units to the districts, rather than keeping a single, understaffed unit downtown. The administration should give a higher priority to the sex-crimes and missing-persons units, so they're not regarded internally as career killers. Detectives and prosecutors need sensitivity training.
"They're very good on details and dates. If they're not sure of something, they say, 'I think such and such,' rather than state it as a fact. The best eyewitnesses consciously draw these lines." The value of personal experiences lies in offering those who hear them a glimpse of the past, he says, especially when the past is painful.

First you'll see the head -- a 40-foot Indian head with feather, carved from sequoia by artist Peter Toth in 1978. Then you'll notice the rest of Cabot's Pueblo Museum (67616 E. Desert View Ave., Desert Hot Springs), a four-level, 35-room mansion built in ersatz Hopi style by Cabot Yerxa, one of the pioneering eccentrics of Desert Hot Springs. To get a good look inside, you sign up for the hourlong tour and learn how Yerxa built the home from recycled materials between 1941 and his death in 1965. Then (because there isn't a lot in Desert Hot Springs to divert your interest) it's time for cocooning in a little spa hotel, of which there are several. The seven-room Sagewater Spa (built in 1954, redone in 2001) gives you mid-century minimalism. El Morocco Inn (66810 4th Street, Desert Hot Springs) is a 2005 revival project with 10 rooms, many veils, three round beds and sparkling Trip Advisor ratings for its service. The six-room Hacienda Hot Springs Inn delivers an Old California feel, including an outdoor kitchen, enormous common table, and plenty of books and desert memorabilia. None of these places is good for children or outdoor cellphone chats.

Much of the talk is about sex, and much of the sex is candid; this is not a movie that looks the other way, whether Russell and Glen are making love or making conversation that first conceals and eventually reveals their yearnings and deep fears. Yet "Weekend," in which a casual hookup becomes a transforming connection, isn't only about gay life. It's about love's essence, and the pain of its absence.

10. Century plant, or Agave americana. This large-scale succulent is a wonderful plant, but is often misused in landscape settings. It can reach a size of 6 to 10 feet, with a bloom height up to 25 feet tall. In the Sonoran Desert it is highly susceptible to the Agave Snout Weevil, which ultimately destroys the plant if not properly treated. It is typically planted in areas that cannot accommodate its large size, and the plants tend to overwhelm small spaces.

The Answer: We think digital books should cost somewhat less than their print counterparts. When we controlled the pricing, we built the business around $9.99. A small group of publishers have taken control of their pricing, and they've raised the prices. It's not surprising that publishers who are raising prices are losing market share relative to publishers who decided to keep prices low. Customers aren't stupid. Ultimately, the market will drive prices.
Yet even bartenders who use the same set of ingredients do not serve the drink the same way. Some shake the gin and other ingredients over ice, strain it into a glass and top it with Champagne.

The team's tumble has created growing criticism of Showalter's decisions, something that didn't exist in September. The bashing from Internet message boards and talk-show callers contains the same themes that were present during Trembley's and Sam Perlozzo's tenures: The manager shows too much deference to veterans, doesn't give younger players an extended look and mismanages his bullpen.
Four of the officers were tried for excessive force. Their acquittal on April 29, 1992, touched off one of the worst urban riots in U.S. history.

In the fourth quarter, ASU had a golden chance to trim Oregon's lead to a touchdown, but Kevin Ozier's holding penalty nullified a Jamal Miles touchdown. As a result, the Sun Devils had to settle for Alex Garoutte's 30-yard field goal. It wasn't enough.

He has advocated a broader approach for years based on the Clean Water Act's stated goal to "restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters."

Also new is the West Hollywood outpost of Bagatelle. Unlike New York’s Bagatelle, which is opening in a new Meatpacking District spot this year, LA’s Bagatelle isn’t about boozy brunch parties. The sexy French vibe and food, plus sharp bartenders and playful cocktail menu (Le Fuzzy Bee is Hendrick’s gin, lavender honey and fresh lemon juice topped with Moet and Chandon champagne) have made this an instant hit.

Congress only begrudgingly named it a territory in the first place, and to gain statehood -- joining the 47 others -- was too grand a gesture for this rude, crude land in the Southwestern desert filled with scoundrels and ne're-do-wells.

Interesting thought, and one that has been proposed by a number of emailers. Turner is expected to be fired as head coach of the Chargers. It is unlikely he will get another NFL head coaching job. Turner runs the same system Martz does, so the transition for Bears players would be minimal. Turner and the Bears would be a somewhat awkward pairing though. Turner's brother Ron was the Bears offensive coordinator before Martz, and Smith fired him. And Turner and Martz remain good friends. They worked together previously and still talk football on a regular basis. I wouldn't completely rule out the possibility, though.

Our work isn't easy in a state that still refuses to expand its legal standard for court-ordered mental health services to include more people than just who pose a danger to self and others.

The Huron report also confirmed what the drafters of Measure B already knew: The time to develop renewable energy sources in Los Angeles is now. L.A.'s power needs are expected to grow by 100 megawatts a year; Measure B's 400 megawatts of solar power would help meet that demand without further polluting our air and straining our aging and overloaded power distribution grid. Importantly, it would not require the construction of expensive, time-intensive and environmentally sensitive transmission lines from the desert. State and federal laws require the DWP to increase renewable energy or risk steep fines; Measure B would help the utility reach these benchmarks on time.

"I wouldn't even attribute that (Lake Oswego's shift) to a conservative movement," said Judie Hammerstad, a Democrat and former Lake Oswego mayor, county commissioner and state legislator. "I would attribute that to people not wanting to pay more taxes. It didn't all come from conservatives."
He served as president of the Maricopa Foundation for Medical Care, as a member of the Arizona Medical Association's board of directors, the board of directors of Arizona Blue Shield, and the executive committee of St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix.

"This is unlikely to drive them away, because it still doesn't contain specific penalties," said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.
As coaches reveal the reserves for the respective conferences, passionate cases will be proffered for the one or two deserving players omitted from the 12-man rosters. It happens every year. Cavaliers coach Byron Scott has a pair of candidates making a late charge, rookie point guard Kyrie Irving and Varejao, a custodian in high tops and headband who's mopped NBA floors for eight seasons with his body parts.
I was nervous at first because I didn't want them to look automated because obviously they are not, she says.
Fletcher, a linebacker who turns 37 on May 19, re-signed with the Redskins this week. He has never missed a game in his NFL career, which started in 1998 with the Rams.
Fellow lovers of fashion not only relish this, but relate to it. How many times have we tried on something amazing that doesn't quite work on our bodies, but we take so much joy in having the piece -- or it's a great deal on sale -- that we take it home anyway? So many times that we've lost count.
Barchi will succeed Richard McCormick, who announced last year he would step down as the leader of the 58,000-student research institution.
Unfortunately, the coleslaw on the croque was so bitter and dry we scraped it off.
Their story chronicles the evolution of medical marijuana in California. It offers conflicting accounts about Mollie Fry and Dale Schafer, as crusaders for healing or profiteering conspirators.
Effectively, this is a champagne-style approach to winemaking. And it works.
Sarkozy came to office on a wave of hope for change that critics say he squandered even before the economic crises hit. They saw his tax reforms as too friendly to the rich, his divorce in office and courtship of supermodel Carla Bruni as unseemly, and his sharp tongue as unfitting for his esteemed role.
"That's all I needed," Bailey said.
Recently, the bank offered Galanida a new modification. The deal would add $99,000 to the loan balance, bringing it to $600,000. His new monthly payment would be $5,200; his interest rate 7.9 percent. It also wanted $16,000 upfront in foreclosure fees and delinquent escrow.

The Miami Marlins manager will apologize again for telling a magazine he loves Fidel Castro by returning to Florida following Monday's victory in Philadelphia and speaking today at Marlins Park. The Phillies and Marlins are off before the series resumes Wednesday.
Alluding to the wide scope of the prosecution, he added: "Today we allege that the corruption we have seen in the trading cubicles, investment firms, law firms, expert consulting firms, medical labs, and corporate suites also insinuated itself into the boardrooms of elite companies."
“At this point in your career, you know what you're good at and what you're not good at. I've never been much of a bunter or anything like that,” Reimold said. “It's good to have the manager say, don't change anything and just go out and play.”

Soon, he was driving 100 mph down the freeway, thinking, "I made it home! What's going to hurt me here?"
Every other local casino saw business fall, most spectacularly River City's sister property, Lumiere Place downtown, were business was off 24 percent from last July (when the baseball All-Star Game likely boosted business there a bit). The two Illinois casinos continued to suffer double-digit declines, while the region's two biggest casinos - Ameristar in St. Charles and Harrah's in Maryland Heights - saw their business sag by 4 percent and 6 percent respectively.
Selig's statement did not address MLB's role in approving McCourt as an owner, or in approving the transaction in which he established a new entity to control the Dodger Stadium parking lots, enabling McCourt to keep half-ownership of the lots even as he sold the team.
Hotel owners and merchants in Mission Bay estimate that revenue has dropped by more than 20% in the first quarter of 2009. They blame part of that decline on the slumping economy, anxiety over job losses and on an alcohol ban on the beach that took effect Jan. 1, 2008. In addition, drug violence and the swine flu outbreak in neighboring Mexico have cut down tourism between Baja California and San Diego.
Obama could take a leadership lesson or two from Bill. The president says his position on the mosque never shifted. But it did. He attempted to hide that shift in nuance and theory.
In addition to information gathered in the U.S., the reporters traced the fugitives in Mexico by getting local birth and marriage certificates, auto registrations, property titles and business licenses, and other government records, as well as local telephone directories.
Q: IF CONVICTED, WHAT KIND OF JAIL TIME MIGHT EDWARDS FACE?
The next morning, we walked to the rim. Lindy had the typical first reaction.
YORBA LINDA, William P. Donovan: In a campaign speech on July 2, 2008, candidate Obama deviated from his TelePrompTer text and offered the following impromptu comments: “We cannot continue to rely on the military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we have set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that is just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.”
Inge, an All-Star in 2009 when he had 84 RBIs, added a sacrifice fly in the seventh for his first game with at least four RBIs since July 5, 2010, against Minnesota. The third baseman was 1 for 10 with four strikeouts in the two previous games.
Isabel had volunteered to help last year by selling opportunity tickets for "Music Under the Stars" and obviously was taken by the family-style celebration atmosphere, perfect venue and the musical tribute-band lineup. And I guess she had fun selling gift baskets benefiting the preservation of our cherished old mission.
It's pretty clear he's playing in the wrong city. Washington, D.C., lost the Senators to Minneapolis in 1961, then surrendered its second reincarnation to Texas 10 years later. Whatever memories were planted in the nation's capital, from Walter Johnson to Frank Howard, this isn't a great baseball town - proved once again by the pathetic crowds (22,675, 16,274 and 19,656) for Harper's first three home games.
Council members have met with Cleveland public schools officials to exchange ideas on getting healthier menus, encouraging more physical activity and helping every school to plant a garden. If children take home positive messages about nutrition, exercise and preventive care, that might be the most powerful tool available to Healthy Cleveland. Other neighborhood-level initiatives would follow.
Service this accommodating can't usually be taught but often comes from incentives, like money or, sometimes, fear. I like to think that it's because this friendly staff understands the nuances of real hospitality.

Officials hope to leave Thursday with two or three playoff proposals that commissioners will take to university presidents, chancellors, athletic directors and coaches.
A similar point was made in a letter that Specter received from Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell  that's right, the official who shares authority over surveillance with Gonzales in the Protect America Act and who is more trusted by at least some members of Congress than the AWOL A.G. Citing McConnell's letter, The Economist drolly concluded: "Perhaps the argument in the hospital room was over data mining rather than eavesdropping. And perhaps Mr. Gonzales is merely a weasel and not a perjurer."

"When they warm up for that team test, it's a different feeling than anything else. I think when we get to that point, this group is going to be so well-bonded and enthused about helping each other that they are going to have tremendous air under their wings from other team members who want them to do well, and not just for the team."
Christie spoke as much to the packed Assembly chamber as to those who urged him to run for president and now speculate about his vice presidential chances. Under his leadership, he said, the state is seen “not exclusively as the butt of late night jokes, but as a focus of the evening news and the Sunday talk shows.”
Some bison have been reported on the loose by neighboring ranchers in North Dakota, Landeis said. The animals escaped by walking over fences and ditches covered with snowdrifts, he said.

We search for perfection. We jump into bed too soon. We distrust, we mistrust and we lose trust.
Gillaspie's current stay in the majors could be short. Sandoval is expected to return in mid-June. Gillaspie could be sent to Fresno even sooner. The Giants are giving Joaquin Arias a look at third base and will need a roster spot if Jeremy Affeldt comes off the disabled list as expected Sunday. They might promote a pitcher as early as Friday night, and Gillaspie is definitely on the block.
this one as soon as you can because it sells out fast. The show is unlike anything you've seen. You sit along rows in a giant stadium with a small bar in front of you. You are served dinner: a rotisserie chicken, a pork loin, corn-on-the-cob, an herb-basted potato, delicious veggie soup, a biscuit and a yummy apple pastry. But there is no silverware; you must eat with your hands. The show in the arena before you ranges from musical numbers by Southern Belles to trick horse riding to a stampede of buffalo. At the end, one side of the stadium is pitted against the other in a battle of North vs. South, with members of the audience pitching in on some of the contests. Some young girls chased chickens; my husband was chosen to throw horseshoes - with a toilet seat. ($63.92 for

Don't misconstrue: I'm not shilling for Tuck here. All I'm saying is if Umenyiora gets a raise, guess who would be next to knock on Reese's door long before his deal expires after the 2013 season.
For quite a while, Giants fans were looking to the day Barry Zito's contract expires, when all those millions would be cleared from the payroll and used on players acquired as difference-makers, preferably hitters.
Schillinger said she supports the fixes but thinks that 1993 levels were only a fluke. Besides, if there was another flood, the village would work to protect the people in Old Valmeyer as they did before the 1993 flood, Village Clerk Laurie Brown said. "They're part of the village," she said.
"We want to be sure that our fare structure is fair and reasonable both to the people who ride the system and also to the taxpaying public who funds 80 percent of the cost to begin with," Nations said during the second meeting, held at the St. Louis County Government Center in Clayton.
Still, this looked nothing like a team sneaking into the postseason. The Giants are barreling through the door with a familiar formula, one that could keep them at the party for a while if things break their way.
As retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens noted in May, the need for legal representation for immigrants has grown so acute and the consequences so drastic that something must be done. Providing mentally disabled detainees court-appointed counsel is an important first step.
But while board members want to keep the idea of more closures in play, they talked about a "seven school model," not a more specific plan. None of them breathed the names of the schools that would close under the two seven-school options before them, Jefferson and Marshall or Lincoln and Franklin.
Mulally would not address how long he will remain CEO. After the meeting he and Bill Ford joked about succession plans with reporters, refusing to give a timeline and repeating that the company will continue to do well when the time does come for him to retire.
The first inkling of the scandal came in 2008, when a press report noted that nearly every LIRR worker retired early, getting an MTA pension and a federal benefit. Looking into the anomaly, federal prosecutors unearthed evidence that at least two doctors and other “facilitators” had for years signed off on fake injuries and ailments so that workers could take their pensions.
Turner, by all accounts, has been a model teammate since, working back into the starting lineup in the second game of the Pac-12 schedule after getting a career-high five steals off the bench in the conference opener against Arizona State on Dec. 31.

I did that because my sister, who's 8 years older than me, when I was a kid, she listened to Supertramp all the time. So when I grew up, I was very familiar with that band. In fact, that was the first rock concert I went to. This song is not one of their hits. It's called "Downstream." And when I was 14, I thought, "I should skate to this, I think it would be nice for skating." Well, that was 30 years ago, and now at the end of my career, which might be in a few months, a few years, I don't know, I said to myself, if you're ever going to skate to this piece of music, you'd better do it. It's an itch that I have to scratch from when I was a kid. It's a great piece of music. It's so beautiful.

Gas prices could be a threat for the U.S. economy, particularly as Iran threatens to cut exports. The average price for a gallon of gasoline is $3.52, the highest on record this time of year, and could climb to $4.25 a gallon by late April.
In "The Science of Evil," Cambridge University psychiatrist Simon Baron-Cohen defines empathy without a spiritual gloss. He calls it "double-mindedness," an individual's ability to take into account the feelings of another. Human cruelty, or simply unkindness, occurs when individuals are single-minded, too wrapped up in their own interests to identify with, let alone respond to, someone else's thoughts or feelings. Translated to the public square, there can be no solutions without double-mindedness, only stalemate between competing goals. Good civics cannot exist without moral engagement, activities that foster understanding and empathy.

Jazzmine Miller, 21, the infant's aunt, wore a shirt that had photographs of her and the baby and the words "Auntie's Angel."
5.) I don't buy the notion that the Mariners sold the Yankees damaged goods. To this point, I haven't seen any evidence to support that claim. Cashman understood the risks involved with dealing for a young high-end arm, many of whom eventually graduate to become injured high-end arms. Cashman believed the risk to be worth the reward. It's hard to fault that logic. The reasoning was sound. Both the teams were dealing players from an area of strength. Considering the teams' respective needs at the time, the deal made sense.
But when it comes to drugs, the MPAA apparently isn't sure what it thinks anymore. It seems especially confused about what kind of drug use can be depicted in movie trailers, the primary means studios have of luring young people to see their films.
The lawsuit says Cooper and Bouchard, their staffs and three State Police employees, including two detectives, have refused to release information about the case to the parents of the victims, preventing them from suing the suspects in civil court.

The candidates then pivoted to the state's ultra-polarized political climate. A Marquette Law School poll released Wednesday found nearly a third of voters who responded said they've stopped talking with someone about politics because of sharp disagreements about the recalls or Walker.
For starters, Coliseum Centre's annual net income of about $8.7 million represents an initial yield of 8.4% on the total price the venture paid. That isn't bad considering the yields on deals in markets such as New York and Washington, D.C., are in the 5% range.

"I did it and it works. It helped me to be patient with my daughter."
Keaton writes not so much in chapters, though there are chapters, but in pieces, some rushed and breathless and vague, others almost journalistic in their determination to get the facts right, all of them evocative of her famously elliptical cadence and non sequitur manner, which is just as effective and irritating here as it is on screen. It would seem that at some point an adult woman of certain experience should be able to speak in simple declarative, unapologetic sentences and write a simple, straightforward book about herself.
Barry Johnson’s review at Oregon ArtsWatch -- in addition to including the marvelous phrase “Thundering turtles” to describe the play’s nagging psychological effect on the audience -- deftly breaks down the philosophical lineage of Reza’s ideas as embodied in her four characters.

3. We'll have a couple of early indicators telling us how Matheny will be received by hardcore baseball people. Will he be resented for taking a very fast short cut into a big-league manager's job, jumping the line ahead of baseball lifers who have waited for 10, 20 years for a shot? If Matheny reaches out to some of La Russa's capos to ask them to stay, it's expected that they'll accept. But suppose one of the old-school coaches rejects Matheny and refuses to work for him? That would certainly raise some questions about internal support for MM.
While the 2011 totals were dramatically higher on a percentage basis, they actually marked a return to more typical levels after an unusually low count in 2010. In fact, last year’s totals were nearly identical to the averages for both roads since 2001 — 25.7 for the turnpike and 37.1 for the parkway.
• Will Oregon’s power brokers forgive Chip Kelly and forget? -- George Schroeder, Eugene Register-Guard: There are indications — and this should not be a surprise — that Knight was upset and very unhappy when it appeared Kelly was leaving. You think Oregon has become a destination job? Knight believes it’s THE destination job. Or should be. He has poured his money and intense affection into the football program. Three years ago he gave Kelly the keys to an exquisite machine. Need something more to fuel its rapid growth? Just call Beaverton. But you have to know the calls back and forth the past few days were not pleasant. As long as the coach keeps winning, sure, Knight forgives. But does he forget?

Word from the Milwaukee clubhouse there at Miller Park after the game was that Wainwright didn't appear to have all of his velocity back and wasn't as sharp with his stuff compared to the last time the Brewers saw him, and yet they still couldn't do much.
The story is full of disguises, assumed identities and other nonsense that accompanies young love, comic-opera style. Count Almaviva wants to marry Rosina, ward of lecherous Doctor Bartolo, who also desires her. Coming to the lovers' aid is Figaro, a barber by trade, but really more of a male Dolly Levi from "Hello, Dolly!"

Oregon's statewide planning goal for natural resources is a long, detailed and sometimes overly technical process with numerous steps which allow for decisions not to protect resources.

No one wants to hear a loved one is dying. But readers said it would help to hear early on about the options for comfort care as well as aggressive care. Then, if things turn south, they would know what kind of relief is possible.
Immigration laws allow illegal and legal immigrants on temporary visas to apply to cancel their deportation if they have been victims of crime, including battering or extreme cruelty by a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and been in the country for three years.

The U.S. Women’s National Team has endured quite a rollercoaster of events throughout the 2011 calendar year. After a memorable run through the Women’s World Cup in Germany earlier this year, the USWNT finished their campaign with an international exhibition against Canada in front of a sellout crowd at JELD-WEN Field. Suffice to say, Abby Wambach and Alex Morgan made sure the home crowd went home happy, as they provided the offense in a 3 to 0 win for the Americans.
What I listen to: Rock.
Here in San Diego, however, as I'm reminded every two years in interviews with Democratic candidates for City Council seats, such sophistication can't be expected. Instead, we see more of the basic ignorance and the cartoonish demonization of Wal-Mart that has blocked local families from benefiting from really cheap groceries.
Praxedes told arresting officers he was unemployed and needed money, Franks said.
More than 100 local celebs worked the tables and entertained more than 1,000 guests at the event, the 21st annual. They raised $90,000 in tips for the St. Louis Crisis Nursery. The event supports the organization's 24-hour safe haven nurseries and programs to prevent child abuse and neglect.
Now go back three decades, to a time of galloping inflation, interest rates and bond yields. When Paul Volcker took over the Federal Reserve in 1979, consumer inflation was 13.3 percent, the highest since 1946. To shrink inflation, Volcker raised interest rates to levels not seen since the Civil War.

Colson was a 38-year-old Washington lawyer when he joined the Nixon White House as a special counsel in November 1969. His "instinct for the political jugular and his ability to get things done made him a lightning rod for my own frustrations," Nixon wrote in his memoirs.
Eugene, Ore., Police Chief Pete Kerns said troubling increases in assaults have coincided with the timing of the financial crisis and the slow recovery. In 2011 aggravated assaults increased to 234, up from 188 in 2010. Simple assaults also were up in 2011 to 1,552, from 1,440 in 2010.
A growing number of Plain Dealer readers have been calling in, asking for information on the special border passes frequent visitors to Canada can apply for. Reporter Laura Johnston wrote about Nexus passes in December, but the basic information is worth repeating as people plan ahead for summer and fall driving vacations. A warning: the process can take several months.
In 1969, after the Johnson administration ended, Katzenbach was appointed IBM's general counsel and helped represent the computer giant in its long fight against an anti-trust lawsuit filed by the government and eventually dismissed. He also served on prison reform panels and remained active in national Democratic politics and constitutional issues. In December 1998, he took part in a protest in Princeton against Republican efforts to impeach President Clinton and also spoke as a witness for the president.

If lawmakers were dismayed by some provisions, they were relieved by some things that are not in the plan. Despite O'Malley's musings last week about the advantages of a sales tax increase, he will make no such proposal, officials said. While some individuals' tax payments may go up, rates themselves will not be touched. Nor will the budget rely on transfers from the Transportation Trust Fund or an increase in the state property tax, sources said.

Taittinger Brut La Francaise, Champagne, France ($36) - This is a true Champagne, not a sparkling wine made with "methode champenoise." This is the creamiest midpriced non-vintage Champagne around. It has a fine, slow-moving bead of bubbles and is a fine straw and yellow gold color. The aroma has subtle Chardonnay characteristics. Its soft mouth-feel is very delicate without losing any complexity; a soft, creamy mousse. The taste has a little richness and a little toast. It finishes with crisp and flavorful fruit. 90 points.

But there's no doubt that, if these Padres don't hit the ball better than they did last year, when they batted .237 as a team, hit 91 home runs and scored 593 runs, they're once again going to be making their beds under the house.

Nobody has tested the boundaries of this new super campaign finance world, which has overwhelmed the laws passed in the 1970s in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Back then, individuals and groups could give campaigns a maximum of $5,000 per election cycle in most cases. The purpose was to eliminate big gifts that could be seen as bribes, while allowing candidates to raise sufficient funds for a national campaign. Surprise, surprise--lawyers found ways around the limits, largely by funneling money through groups that were not a formal part of any campaign and were focused on "issues" rather than directly electing candidates. This freed up unions, businesses, and public interest groups to engage in political campaigns, as long as they remained independent of all parties and candidates.

2:54 -- After that sack, it looks like Umenyiora isn't having trouble lining up on the left side. Umenyiora sacks Romo for a 7-yard sack on third down from the left side, with Tuck inside and Pierre-Paul on the right side. It was his eighth of the season. That would've all been for naught after Will Blackmon muffed the ensuing punt, bu the Cowboys couldn't jump on it and Greg Jones recovered for the Giants. That's two muffed punts already tonight — one from each team. The rain may be playing a factor.

The debts -- often five or six years old -- are purchased from companies like cellphone providers and credit card issuers, and cost a few cents on the dollar. Using automated dialing equipment and teams of lawyers, the debt-buyer firms try to collect the debt, plus interest and fees. A firm aims to collect at least twice what it paid for the debt to cover costs. Anything beyond that is profit.

In the 2003 and 2004 seasons, the Patriots knocked the Colts out of the playoffs. This was reflective of a time when the Patriots had the mental edge, whether in the way the defense countered the Colts offense or the way Belichick made the right moves quicker and more effectively than Tony Dungy.
In the draft: Offensive line is definitely a position the Lions could address early, and they have the luxury of sitting any draft pick for a year to further his development if necessary. Cordy Glenn is imposing physically at 6-feet-6 and 345 pounds and the most versatile lineman in the draft. Jonathan Martin needs to get stronger, but he could start for a decade at left tackle. And Mike Adams has all the physical tools the Lions desire, but he has plenty of off-field issues, too. If the Lions miss on guards David DeCastro and Amini Silatolu early, they should find a backup to develop in the middle rounds.

The increase also would prevent layoffs of 17 teacher positions.

Ohio State's response included the addition of one player who was suspended for five games for the start of the 2011 season for receiving benefits from tattoo parlor owner Ed Rife.

The margin for an automatic recount is less -- 0.2 percent.
That night, we were seriously in need of comfort food. For Italians (or would-be ones), that inevitably means pasta. Good thing, because this kitchen excels at it. These pasta dishes are elegant, citified takes on regional classics. Cappellacci (a stuffed pasta similar in shape to tortellini) stuffed with pumpkin are terrific. The pasta is al dente, the elements in the filling — the pumpkin, the crushed amaretti cookies, the pepperoncino and cheese — in exquisite balance. But it's the texture that captivates, each bite slightly different from the next.

After a successful day hike to the bottom of the Grand Canyon and back last summer, my brother, Yashodhan, and I decided to take on a more ambitious trek this year. With five friends, we would hike 11 miles to the 14,500-foot summit of Mount Whitney and back. Mount Whitney, in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains, is the highest peak in the continental United States, and the trail to the top rises more than 6,000 feet.
It would be less invasive and recovery would be quicker. That's because in a traditional craniotomy the surgeon has to cut a big whole through the scalp, and pull a piece of the skull down. But with an eyebrow craniotomy the incision is through the eyebrow, it's a much smaller incision and the brain does not retract as much. Mirjam said it was a relief to know that they didn't have to open up her skull and brain and she says the recover was so easy.

But what kind of immigrants should we allow in? Should it be a random, first-come-first-served kind of thing? Or should the law be totally focused on family ties (as it is now): if you become a citizen, you can also apply for citizenship for your parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins? Those of us who favor the expansion of legal immigration owe our fellow citizens some sketch of the regulations we favor to control it.

"I thought he would stay in Cleveland, because I thought all he cared about was adoration. I was wrong about Cleveland, but he is wrong about adoration. He thinks he'll get it by winning a title. He has insulated himself from the world, surrounded himself with yes men. He has no idea how much backlash he is about to get. That's one of the great ironies of this -- James is trying to flee pressure, but he will just face more of it. He is trying to maximize his 'brand,' but he just damaged it."

Last spring, facing mounting pressure from states, Craigslist decided to start manually screening adult-oriented ads and said it would charge $10 per listing to do so.

One longtime scout, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said Jeter found himself on the defensive. He appeared to doubt his own swing, which he had attempted to revamp last year, only to ditch the changes during the season. He no longer trusted it enough to punish those inside fastballs.
What you'll study: Students who plan to transfer to a four-year school have a course load that's similar to the first two years of a four-year program - general education classes, plus some classes in a particular field of study.

Robinson met Hunter S. Thompson only once, more or less in passing in the early 1990s at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, and the two barely spoke a word to each other — "I didn't have anything to ask him, and he certainly didn't have anything to say to me." Despite the respect the production had for Thompson — Depp had a chair with the writer's name on it placed on-set every day — Robinson felt he had to make his own movie.

She also says she apologized to Caroline's face when she heard she was upset by the book. "Sorry this is so long and seems like I'm defensive, but I guess I am because I've worked so hard on my cookbooks, they mean a lot to me, and I'm not going to sit quietly while someone tries to make up YET ANOTHER FAKE STORY to make me look bad.

Any justice system worth its name must regard a 14-year-old, or any teenager, differently than an adult. Juveniles don't have the same legal rights and responsibilities as adults because they lack the maturity and judgment to handle them. Teenagers are more impulsive and unstable than adults, even disregarding the abuse and dysfunctional homes many kids who wind up in the criminal justice system have experienced, or the violence and easy access to guns that have become staples of their young lives.

It might strike some as odd that a white director is guiding these two productions. (Debbie Allen directed the 2008 African American production of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" on Broadway that paved the way for this "Streetcar.") But these works engage themes and concerns that Mann — a playwright as well as a director, best known for her Broadway production of "Having Our Say" — has been preoccupied with throughout her career. As someone who worked with her more than a decade ago at the McCarter, I can attest that the two poles of her sensibility — the poetic realism side and the social justice side — are united in these projects.
The availability of a flight without connections often affects a company's willingness to send someone on a trip, Turk said. Many companies send employees to and from a destination in a single day.

He will be creating something new in Indianapolis, while also trying to fit into a tradition. It's not unfamiliar territory for Luck, this business of being part of something big rather than standing alone. He became the fourth Stanford quarterback to be chosen No. 1, joining John Elway, Jim Plunkett and Bobby Garrett. Only one other school, Notre Dame in the 1940s, has produced even two quarterbacks who led off the draft.
In modern homes, "they are filling space between floor and ceiling with as much glass as they can," says Jay Sandgren, an architectural representative for Andersen. He says builders are being "a lot smarter" about positioning a home and the roof overhang to capture the most sunlight in winter and to block much of the heat from the sun in summer.
4. Coach Thad Matta didn't play Amir Williams enough. That was probably because of Thomas' foul problems and a concern of where, oh, where would the offense come from with Williams on the floor. But three minutes? The 6-11 freshman would have made 7-footer Jeff Withey play him and not enjoy his snuff-the-shot display against Sullinger.

"Washington has heard our message, the president has responded with more boots on the ground, and we're going to work to make sure that we continue to take border security seriously," said Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz.
The mistakes of cornerbacks do not go undetected. Not often. Often, they are spectacular in their clarity, and humiliating in the result. Just a few boo-boos, in too short of a time period, and the confidence of the steeliest men can corrode, spooking them into playing the position as if they're free safeties, playing themselves right onto the waiver wire and out of the NFL.
Instead of a season full of potential that was never reached a la Cliff Harris, fans will remember Alonso's performance on the biggest of stages, when the Ducks needed it most. Without Alonso's performance, the Ducks probably wouldn't have won their first Rose Bowl trophy in 95 years.
The chef often riffs on a single vegetable: on two occasions he threw in an extra course featuring peas. He first creates a gelee from a bouillon made from the pods and flavored with thyme, bay leaf and mint. He then adds both cooked and raw peas, sugar snaps and a sweet pea cream made with creme fraiche and olive oil. He tops it with leaves, shoots, blossoms and a sprinkling of briny seaweed.

But even more than that, Jeter has handled himself with consummate professionalism. Focused, driven, consistent for so long, trying to get to the 3,000 milestone now and not turn into a shadow of himself on the journey, never a good quote, but always a cooperative one, Jeter set the tone for a generation of Yankees who played the game the right way and handled oppressive media attention without letting it diminish them.

If there's any good news in the lease for the CVC, it's that the number of seats and luxury boxes are excluded from first-tier consideration. About 66,000 fans can now attend football games at the Dome, which boasts 120 luxury suites and 6,400 club seats. Those numbers aren't required to change.
"It went up in the air, into the sun, and dropped," an upset Kinsler said before walking away from reporters.
That's why I'm actually relatively sanguine about the possibility that foreign central banks could trigger a sudden dollar decline simply out of a desire to diversify their porfolios; I think that the PBOC and other central banks around the world, such as the Persian Gulf countries, have too much depending on a stable dollar. Instead, what worries me is the possibility that private investors around the world would decide to dump dollars, presumably because they foresee capital losses due to an incipient decline in the dollar. Perhaps myopically, international investors don't act like they expect those capital losses right now. But at some point they might.

St.Louis for the last 25 years. I got an opportunity to be part of Interfaith Partnership in August 2001.From day one I have felt this great organization promoting understanding. A month later America and its Muslims population went through a devastating experience. As an American Muslim I felt I did not have time to grieve over the terrorist attacks and had to start defending my faith soon after. I saw strong support from majority of our community at large and especially the Interfaith Partnership; I also received hateful comments about Islam and Muslims. I was not naïve to think that the sentiments against Muslims will change quickly, but hoped that over time we will be able to explain our faith and dispel the myths.
