They certainly can't celebrate their shooting. The Sixers haven't cracked 90 points in any of their last three games and were held to 69 in the Game 5 loss. The desperate Bulls held the Sixers to season lows for points and shooting (32.1 percent), in fact. The Sixers shot 39 percent from the floor in a Game 4 victory, 34 percent in a Game 3 win, and 40 percent in a Game 2 win. Those percentages are only going to beat a team like the Bulls ravaged by injury.

I'm one of those taxpayers; one of the Baltimoreans burdened with a usurious property tax rate double the rate in any other Maryland jurisdiction, and concerned at the opaqueness of the search now underway. The 2011 Indy race was dumped in our laps so quickly we hardly had time to blink before traffic was being rerouted and downtown streets being resurfaced in anticipation of what we were told would be a can't-lose for Baltimore, a sure draw of tourist dollars, a way to enhance the city's image as the place to be for major sporting events.

Even the unstated but important motives driving opposition to the pipeline are hogwash. The environmentalists to which Mr. Obama is pandering have an understandable, if at times irrational, fear of oil spills and a religious faith in the dangers of global warming. The only problem is that blocking the pipeline will, if anything, increase the likelihood of oil spills because Canada will still bring the oil to market. But if it can't sell it to America it will sell it to China, which will bring it home via tankers, which spill more often -- and more calamitously -- than pipelines. Moreover, China will still burn the oil, meaning the effects -- real or alleged -- on global warming will be the same (or marginally worse, given the "footprint" of tankers). Also, the U.S. will still buy oil -- only we'll get more of it from the Middle East, again via tankers, deepening our dependence on their oil (another Obama bugaboo).

On Florida's Turnpike, for example, that bill comes with an extra $2.50 administrative fee -- not $25.

With James down, Ducks fans chanted his name. Teammates clapped when he was carried to the cart, too. The media in the press box at Autzen followed the cart's path as it circled in the backfield -- just like James does -- and headed toward the goal line.

To the NATO force, it is a source of epic and enduring frustration that most Afghans tend to make little distinction between civilian deaths caused by the Taliban and affiliated militant groups, and those attributed to foreign forces.

Invest in research. If there is ever to be a final solution to the drug problem, it will come from medical breakthroughs on how we treat addiction.

One reason for this is the grape itself, which is often described as "transparent." Riesling is wonderfully capable of transmitting the character of a particular terroir of just about anywhere in the world, though arguably no more so than in its native Germany. In that way, Riesling is a bit like the white-grape counterpart to Pinot Noir, the great red grape of Burgundy. Its salient characteristics are also similar to Pinot: It's marked by a bright, almost shimmering acidity and beguiling aromas of minerals, florals and fruit, though in the case of Riesling the latter tends to be peach, pear and apricot.

øWar Horse: The buzz is about the Flyers' cadre of young contributors led by Brayden Schenn who has six points in six games, plus Sean Couturier, who has been compared to a young Ron Francis. But it's 40-year-old Jaromir Jagr that should worry the Devils more than the youngsters. The old war horse can still lead the charge.

I'm not about to run out to the sperm bank or to freeze my eggs. I'm still ambivalent, and single.

If I have a child, I'll tell her or him, you were first conceived in Bernal Heights.

The Rays notched their second victory of the preseason with strong hitting, pitching and defense. Vintero and David Veliz were double threats on the mound as well as at the plate. Both combined to allow no runs or hits in their single innings pitched. Vintero and Veliz also combined to drive in 10 of the Rays 15 runs. The defense was highlighted by Reyes in the fourth inning. With runners on fist and second and no outs, Reyes snatched a low liner in left-centerfield. He then fired to second base and doubled-up the runner who made a valiant dive to get back to the base in time. For the Cards, Passanisi-Boullet pitched shutout baseball to keep them within striking distance. Arrastio had three hits to lead the offense. Dylan Archuleta, Ethan Pang, Lucas Supnet-Lutu, and Dylan Macias were also offensive standouts for the Cards. On defense, Archuleta and Supnet-Lutu did a great job behind the dish. The game ball went to Damien Blake, who made a run saving catch in the outfield.

If the Packers pull off an upset in Philadelphia, then the Bears will be hosting the worst playoff team in NFL history a week from today. That's a good thing, right?

Others note the fundamental differences between Gandhi's struggle to throw off colonial rule and Mr. Hazare's push to influence the legislative process. "This isn't a replay of the dynamics leading up to independence," said Mira Kamdar, a senior fellow at the World Policy Institute. "This isn't Mahatma Gandhi redux." Still, she said, Mr. Hazare has proved to be a "master strategist" who can mobilize the masses, as Gandhi was.

As unsettling as the premise for the games is, Ross and cinematographer Tom Stern do their best to avoid showing the strongly implied bloodshed, while still sustaining a palpable sense of danger. They may have been able to land the coveted PG-13 rating, but the overuse of handheld camera and visually erratic fight sequences they used to keep most of the gore off camera should land it a warning for motion sicknesses.

Many of the 50 million Americans who don't have health insurance can afford to buy it but don't. Their medical costs are passed to the insured, just as retailers pass along the cost of shoplifting through higher prices to honest consumers. The cost of "uncompensated" health care (costs not picked up by the insured or by taxpayers) is about $1,000 annually per insured family, according to a 2009 study by Families USA. By striking down the individual mandate, the Supreme Court would be defending fraud committed by those who choose not to pay for health insurance against the millions of Americans who do.

The amazing thing about Padres batsmen - and this isn't the first San Diego team to do this - is that, while historically one or two players on a team go into slumps at the same time, the Padres tend to do it all at once. It becomes a pandemic.

When it comes to workforce development, one of the most important things that we've all learned is how important it is to get businesses in early with the universities and the community colleges -- a hugely under-utilized resource -- to develop the actual training program so that young people have confidence if they go through this training program, they've got a job; businesses have confidence that if they hire these young people who went through the training program, they are trained for those jobs.

The special tribunal on Sierra Leone was sponsored by both the government of Sierra Leone and the United Nations -- prompting Taylor's supporters in Liberia to label it a kangaroo court.

More and more, as the years pass, I find myself looking to the elderly Christians I've known over my lifetime - the "saints of the church", as we often refer to them. I look to someone like Pauline, who is 93 this year. She has been in our church since she was 19 years old. Pauline loved her husband and raised her children and led, from all I know, a pretty ordinary life. She taught children's Sunday school for decades and bestowed little gifts on the children of the church (including my own), and always has a wonderful word to say about the goodness of God. I've never heard Pauline complain that she didn't get to be a missionary or end human trafficking. I've also never heard her complain that the music in the service doesn't move her or the preacher doesn't deliver like they did in the old days. She is faithful. She is content. She is a saint and loved by everyone who knows her.

I certainly was no hero, as some of my friends were, however, I ALWAYS felt a strong responsibility to fulfill what I was doing with the utmost diligence. I was stationed at Foggia Main in Italy on V-E Day with the 18th Air Depot Group, Headquarters Squadron. We were the returning base of B-17s and B-24s when they received damage or injuries during raids over Germany. A hospital was just a couple of miles from the base.

5. The Warriors' zone defense might give the Lakers some trouble. Being a Syracuse grad, I'm always here to defend the 2-3 zone. It entices teammates into rushed outside shots and forced passes instead of relentlessly attacking the gaps inside. The Lakers usually don't see too many three-point shots they don't like. But the Lakers should only take these if they come off crisp ball movement and are in rhythm with the offense.
To serve, warm peach preserves. Spread evenly on cornbread strips. Cut each cornbread strip into 1 1/2-inch squares. Place 1 slice pork tenderloin and 1 grilled peach slice on each cornbread square.

That's what British historian Ronald Wright calls a "progress trap." It's a crisis that occurs when innovators deplete the very elements that allowed them to initially advance, like parasites killing off their host. The accessible, visually striking and lucidly reasoned "Surviving Progress" argues that civilization is now at such a brink, like the Sumerians, Mayans and Easter Islanders of old. "Unlimited economic progress in a world of finite natural resources doesn't make sense. It's bound to collapse," says naturalist Jane Goodall.

We consider it unwise for Maryland to expand its gambling program before the existing one is even fully off the ground. However, Mr. O'Malley's idea at least allows the opportunity for a more rigorous study than was possible during the legislative session of the market conditions in the state and the likely impact of any changes to the number of locations, tax rates or types of games allowed. If, after that, there is no strong case to be made for a gambling expansion or no clear consensus in the legislature to support one, the second special session could be called off.
He had been in the restaurant business before. Fatha's Pork House lasted about nine years until the early '70s, when a security guard was killed by patrons he had asked to leave. Thimes' wife opted to close the restaurant out of concern for the family's safety.

Cooper convinced assorted well-known character actors to take bit parts – Marla Gibbs, Ed Asner and Jenifer Lewis. He cast against type using Harris, best known as a gangster on "The Wire," as a doctor. It's a bit jarring to hear diagnoses delivered as though the "doctor" has never uttered those words before, or laced with street epithets, to see an attending physician lighting up a joint every spare moment. Harris is miscast.

In Peyton Manning, the Broncos are trying to take the ultimate short cut. If Manning can play quarterback at the level he did before his neck injury, the Broncos can overcome some of their unfortunate draft picks of the past 11 seasons. Bad drafting is the primary reason the Broncos have only one playoff appearance — and that was an 8-8 gift in 2011 — in the past six seasons.

The most impressive part is the suave balance on the palate. It's appreciably malty (though lager-gold in color) and also a bit hoppy, but creamy carbonation takes on part of the work of balancing the malty sweetness. This neat balance lasts through a fairly long finish, ultimately with a dry effect, magically accomplished without a very sharp bite of hops.
Almost all of the hostility in the U.S. toward Iran comes from Israel and its powerful pro-Israel lobby, who have been promoting a U.S. attack on Iran for years. Recently, an editorial in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz stated "Israel is using Iran to sidestep Mideast peace talks."
