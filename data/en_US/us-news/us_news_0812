And juries of our peers have agreed with Stamper's assessment, repeatedly. Seattle paid out $1.8 million to WTO protesters due to the violence and other misconduct of its police officers. Washington, D.C., paid out $22 million to protesters and bystanders due to police violence and other misconduct during two protests in 2000 and 2002. Los Angeles paid close to $12.85 million for a police attack on a 2007 May Day rally.

If you want to pay for this boondoggle, vote for the "Big Spenders Party" (Freese and Allevato belong) in November. Otherwise, please find some council candidate on the ballot who will promise faithfully to make an intelligent decision to move on and cut all the outrageous losses. We will then know for sure whether our council can be fiscally conservative and not merely pretenders.

This is a rarely performed work (the SLSO last played it under Leonard Slatkin in 1976); Petrenko made a strong case for hearing it more frequently. He bought out its rapturous elements as well as its sorrow, the theme of life as well as Rachmaninoff's beloved "Dies irae," building to a moment of hope and then reverting to sorrow.

Many of the afternoon events also feature arts-and-crafts fairs with music and food. They each provide a stroll through neighborhoods and an invitation to step inside the front door.
I went to South By Southwest to cover Bruce Springsteen's keynote and show. But it is impossible to go to Austin at this time of the year without encountering music wherever you turn: on streetcorners, in storefronts, in grocery stores, under traffic cones. Okay, I made that last one up. But if I'd lifted a traffic cone on Red River and found a band -- likely a New York City band -- blaring away under there, I wouldn't have been too surprised.
Conventional wisdom: Recent issues with sticking accelerators notwithstanding (not on the Sienna), Toyota has long been at the top of the heap for quality and amenities. And Siennas have topped minivan safety lists from the beginning.

Other cities have installed sensors or cameras that trip flashing signs warning drivers they’re driving against traffic. On a Houston toll road, for example, radar detectors can sense a car going the wrong way and signs will flash to alert the driver. More to the point, however, highway signs will alert other drivers that there’s a ding-bat headed their way. (The actual wording: “Warning: Wrong-way driver ahead. All motorists pull to the shoulder and stop.”) The system also alerts police, who can get in front of the driver and stop him with spike strips. The cost: $350,000.

McCoy made another nice play on a pump-fake and then throw to Josh Cribbs for 25 yards to the Steelers' 5. Two plays later from the 2, McCoy dropped back, saw the middle open and scooted and dived for the end zone. Officials signaled touchdown.

Pliscou's book not only serves as a motivator to get your little couch potatoes to go outside and play, but it also subtly encourages children to appreciate the importance of the oceans and beaches. On the book's opening pages, Pliscou invites readers to check out the website of the grassroots Surfrider Foundation.

Voters have never approved a tax increase for the college. SCC's total property tax rate of 21.96 cents per $100 assessed valuation has provided more income because St. Charles County's assessed valuation rose with booming residential development; but with the recession, assessed valuation has dropped and could remain flat for some time.

Car buyers are not purchasing a product they expect to consume immediately or within the next couple of months. They expect their cars will last half a decade or more. Nearly all of them hope the car's warranty will be honored, its parts will continue to be available, and plenty of mechanics will be around to take care of the vehicle. An auto company's impending or actual bankruptcy would severely shrink demand for its products, and the effect would not be temporary.

Sophomore QB Steve Shimko was limited all camp and may possibly be done for the season. This means that Dodd, who was impressive in camp, is possibly the true backup to Savage. It will be interesting to see how the team handles the garbage time in the Norfolk State game. It was expected that the plan was to redshirt Dodd to place a two year distance between himself and Savage. But out of necessity he may need to play right away. Of course the team could try and get by the Norfolk State game with possibly Deering playing some QB and redshirt freshman Tyler Bellia coming in and just handing off. But in any case, Dodd, whose high school rankings were downgraded because of his size, showed that the stats he piled up in high school with one of the best teams in the country were not the product of a system

We do have many blessings, and in small ways, some of us might be better off than last year. Yet, a great many stockings still hang empty this year. Christmas 2011 shows us there is still much to do. We have 49 million Americans in poverty, nearly one in two is low income or below. About 17 million children go hungry. Nearly 50 million have no health insurance. Over 24 million are in need of full-time work. Record numbers are in jail. The Army Times reports 18 veterans commit suicide every day.

Equipment-wise, I'd pictured miniature bikes with seats lower than my knees. And I was right, sort of. Plenty of people do in fact ride small bikes with stiff frames, but just as many also prefer normal-sized, mountain-style bikes with shocks. I rode the latter in total comfort, never minding the extremely low seat. In this sport, there's not much time or use for sitting, anyway.

Suddenly, an older man in a hand-carved canoe appears and gestures for our boat to follow him down a small tributary. We spook a snowy egret, which swoops across the narrow and dark river, and the air is suddenly cooler, smelling of damp earth. We exit the boat onto a small banana field and are led to a conical roadside hut made from cane grass, where we are greeted with a delicious meal of rice and beans, fruit, meat, fried plantains and tortillas. Our overnight host, Guido Quesada, arrives, acknowledging that he is slightly nervous at the thought of sleeping 13 on his land. "Tourism here is not there yet," he says. "It's not for everybody." He laughs, adding, "It's very, very exclusive."

The army is not unified on this, of course. What we have here is a rabid splinter group of fans that is splintered within itself.

The Barn (400 Third St., 303-814-0066, thebarncastlerock.com) is a co-op of more than two dozen antiques and specialty shops delightfully crammed into one enormous former lumber company building — and it's easy to spend an entire afternoon (or more) exploring every exquisitely decorated nook and cranny.

(Kleinedler once had the audacity to say, during an NPR interview about the American Heritage Usage Panel, "Every year, we send out the panel a ballot full of questions asking their opinions."

Brossoie said: “We’re doing a better job of discharging patients who are stabilized back into the community with appropriate supports, in a more timely fashion.

The city is currently barred by injunction from seizing the property of the homeless in the downtown skid row area, and rightly so. Nor is there any reason why officials should be able to sweep through Venice and collect the belongings of the homeless there. The bags and carts of street dwellers contain the essentials of their lives. People sometimes park their belongings on sidewalks while they go to shower or find a meal. Confiscating them is an unsatisfactory solution to the problem.

"We’re doing it because we feel it’s best for him, his career and his health. It’s the best way to keep him healthy and strong. It gives us the best opportunity to do that. It’s easier to maintain that and keeping tabs on this in the bullpen than it is as a starter. We already know he’s a good left-handed reliever. That’s been proven over the past 1½ years. Now we’ll be trying to make him one of the best left handed relievers in baseball, not just in the American League.

They already know that salt receptors are more complicated than sugar receptors, which work like a simple lock-and-key system. They also know that salt receptors take the form of pore-like channels in cell membranes through which only sodium can sneak to send the pure, clean taste of salt to the brain. A lot of different receptors and other molecules appear to be involved, and much is still unknown.
Deborah Leonard, executive director of the Great Lakes Independent Booksellers Association in Grand Haven, Mich., which represents 170 stores across the Midwest, said: "There are a lot of people who think (Borders) brought it on themselves, because they just kept doing things that didn't make sense or bringing people on board from outside the publishing industry who didn't understand books."

What Leavy is getting at is the afterlife, or the underlife, of a player such as Mantle, the moment everything gets real. It's easy to overlook beneath the gaudy numbers, all those home runs and World Series titles, but the point is to look at players less as heroes than as human beings.

So far, so good, at least from the perspective of land development. But the conservatives now in charge on Capital Square bemoan the layering of government in Ohio, which already has more than 3,000 governmental units, each with its turf, powers -- and costs. It may be that massaging Ohio's new communities law, which House-passed HB 153 would do, is the next best thing to a Wall Street bull market. But that could expand the number of local governments and, either way, no taxpayers will ever hear either pros or cons if the new-communities idea is shoveled into a budget thick as the Sears catalog once was.

Lower administrative costs alone wouldn't provide enough savings to control overall spending. If open-ended reimbursement survived, so would the existing system.
