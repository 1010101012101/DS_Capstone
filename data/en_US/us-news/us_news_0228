The argument over the role of poverty in student learning had its defining moment in 1966, when Johns Hopkins University researcher James Coleman authored his landmark study, "Equality of Educational Opportunity." Authorized by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the study was expected to show that minority students were being denied a quality education due to inadequate funding of schools. Instead, Coleman found that other factors, such as the income and educational level of a child's family and classmates, were more important determinants of success. The findings suggested that minority students would benefit by being in more integrated schools. As a result, many districts implemented plans to transport black students to majority-white schools in the late-1960s and 1970s (a practice the Supreme Court eventually struck down in a number of districts).

And in the second case, Missouri v.

Mattern and Jullapat, Campanile veterans who most recently were in charge of the kitchen at Ammo, operate in the tradition of Los Angeles pan-Mediterranean cooking, sometimes called urban rustic cuisine — you may recognize a cioppino-inflected version of Mark Peel's grilled-seafood soup — although the occasional sharp North African edge seems all their own.

The rustic wines, most sold by both the bottle and the glass, are supervised by Claudio Blotta, who also started his local career at Campanile before moving on through La Terza and Barbrix (which he also owns). It's the kind of list with more Bonardas than Cabs.

Romney's huge advantage in money and organization has allowed him to stay ahead of his challengers but not leave them in the dust. Nevertheless, in a marathon like this, staying ahead and crossing the finish line first is all that matters, no matter how long it may take.

Gunn and his stable of guides can corroborate the claim, having witnessed the ups and downs of the Lees Ferry fishery since rainbow trout were introduced after the completion of Glen Canyon Dam in the mid-1960s. With 83 reservoirs in its upper basin and 10 reservoirs in the lower basin, the Colorado River Basin is considered the most heavily regulated river system in the world. And the colossal dam in the heart of it all — Glen Canyon — has been something of a water management experiment since its origin.

When one of my weekend students told me about this idea, I was intrigued. Even though I've never had an aquarium, nor do I have a green thumb, I simply couldn't resist trying this project. According to my source, Tyler Breaux, a floral designer from Chicago, there are some key points to remember: 1) Only one fish; 2) Clean all the soil off of the plants (tedious); and 3) Use plants that have roots that can survive in water. This project also makes good reuse of those urn-shaped floral vases lined up in the cabinet under your sink. This is a Mother's Day gift she won't forget.

A unique part of the experience, several stars said, was the camaraderie they developed working so closely uninterrupted for such a long period, a rare occurrence in the life of busy actors. It was a fight to block out everyone's schedules for eight weeks straight — like herding cats, Broadbent said — but it was also a reunion of sorts, since most had worked together in the past.

He runs the garden across the street, just shy of 3 acres, which provides 30 percent of the kitchen's produce (see today's Home & Garden cover story). Fruits and vegetables are harvested day of by Taylor and his team, so chefs can request produce just so - 2-inch baby zucchinis, 4-inch carrots. Unwanted produce gets kicked down the line to sister restaurants Bouchon and Ad Hoc.

The chow: If you've heard of Killer Burger before, it's probably for their peanut butter-pickle-bacon burger, a serious pregnancy craving or Elvis Presley snack. It sounds like a disaster, but it's actually pretty good, the peanut butter thinned down to more of a Thai-restaurant-style peanut sauce, and the bacon, pickle and grilled bun lending plenty of texture.
The church has thrown the baby out with the bath water with its sense of “conscience” in its efforts against ENDA. Because of its belief that homosexuality is “wrong,” it continues to allow discrimination in the workplace. How does “conscience” fit into that? One’s conscience can be easily ignored, and when it comes to two groups in this country, homosexuals and women, the church has no apparent problem in doing so.
The concert concluded with a crowd-pleaser, Gershwin's "An American in Paris," given a big brassy reading.

My first exposure to Austen tourism was on a visit to Bath, the lovely but tourist-filled spa town with its famous Regency-era crescent. Austen visited the Lower Assembly Rooms and the town's famed Pump Room, both of which look much as they did in Austen's time. My wife sought out the house on Sydney Place where Austen lived. When she stood in the doorway, it was as if I were witnessing the literary equivalent of a pilgrimage to Lourdes. Austen herself had mixed feelings about Bath, which taught her much about the class-based manners and backbiting that would be laced throughout her books. Both "Northanger Abbey" and "Persuasion" are set primarily in and around Bath. Neighborhoods just a few hundred yards apart had widely different social standing. Austen once wrote a relative of the social claustrophobia, lamenting, "I hate tiny parties; they force one into constant exertion," an idea echoed by Anne Elliott in "Persuasion," who complains of returning to Bath for the social season, "with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment of many months." Whatever Austen thought of Bath, Bath loves Austen. There is a Jane Austen Centre chronicling her life on Gay Street. The death of her father in 1805 had Austen on the move again.

This romantic drama is the edgiest-ever film adaptation of the writings of Nicholas Sparks -- which isn't saying much. Beth (Taylor Schilling) is a willowy and gorgeous single mom running a kennel with her speaks-her-mind grandma (Blythe Danner). Logan (Zac Efron) is a brooding but chivalrous ex-soldier who tracks her down after finding a photo of her on a battlefield in Iraq. He charms her, but she's slow to warm to him. Director Scott Hicks lifts this material above previous Sparks-inspired movies ("Dear John," "The Last Song") by holding his revelations in reserve and producing a scene or two of real sexual heat. But at every turn, Sparks hurls obvious melodramatic obstacles in the way, telegraphs his story's every move and underlines every emotion. Rated PG-13; sexuality, violence. 1 hour, 41 minutes. By Roger Moore, McClatchy-Tribune News Service.

She's having his baby: Teresa goes into labor. At the hospital, she calls up Dina Manzo, who asks Teresa whether she managed to pretty up her chuckie for delivery ("I tried to shave yesterday, yeah, as much as I could see," Teresa confirms; classy!) We watch the epidural. Primal scream. Then Teresa says, "How do I look?" Teresa either bans the camera crew from the delivery room -- the mental image from the chuckie a few moments back was apparently enough -- or Bravo opts out of the actual delivery; whatever, all we get is sound and the picture of the delivery room door. Sobs. Screams. Mews. Screams. Moans. Baby screams. Welcome Audriana. Cute baby sneeze. Dina comes to visit Teresa, who tells her she'd like Dina to be the baby's godmother. "You're supposed to pick somebody who you would want your daughter to be like," Teresa tells her, "and I would for her to be just like you." Aw. A genuine moment.

JILL ALPER: We're at the year anniversary of our column, and I'd like to thank our readers. We'd like to kick off this election year by hosting an ad competition. If you could create a political ad for the Republicans or Democrats, what would it look like?
Why does Sept. 11 persist as a symbol while other disasters fade from memory? There are many answers, but the one that means the most to me is the human one. The terrorists did not just take life; they tried to make life and our civilization meaningless. This was not war. The victims were just people going about their lives: mothers, fathers, sons, daughters and even little children. The horror of Sept. 11, as with all terrorism and genocide, is that someone's political idea becomes more important than human life.
Perhaps that's why Whedon weaves the challenge of chemistry into the fabric of the story (conceived with Zak Penn). Can six superheroes accustomed to going it alone unite to save the world from a very embittered bro? A great deal of the early fun comes from watching the bumpy, brawling meet-and-greets, especially between Thor, Iron Man and Captain America. What different mindsets these guys have: Stark is the charismatic corporate egotist; Thor (Hemsworth) is a god increasingly fond of his human wards; Capt. America (Chris Evans) is arguably the most human among them.

Romney, a virtual lock to be Obamas Republican opponent in the November election, has employed some rhetorical gymnastics on the campaign trail to criticize Obamas handling of the auto bailouts while cheering the survival of General Motors and Chrysler, and even  in Ohio on Monday  saying that he, Romney, deserves a lot of credit for the auto industry revival because he suggested managed bankruptcies for GM and Chrysler.
The result: 57 percent of all Utt's school's eighth-graders know their algebra, which educators see as a gateway to critical thinking, higher math and science courses and a necessary first step on the path to college.
Desserts have a whimsical bent, and also hopscotch the globe. A thick, almost pudding-like cup of pleasantly bitter hot chocolate is served with three warm sugar-dusted churros ($9.50); a homey pear crisp comes with a buttery pecan streusel crowned with a scoop of gingersnap ice cream; and warm chocolate cake is topped with a lush hot fudge sauce. The cake may be ubiquitous, but the unexpected addition of chiles, and a side of red beet ice cream, makes it distinctive.
Martins and other residents had high hopes when law enforcement arrived to seize control of the neighborhood in a much-hyped security program meant to prove that this Olympic city is capable of stemming endemic violence — among the promises made during Rio's candidacy to host the 2016 Games.
The temporary injunction bars the state from enforcing any aspect of the law and indicates that Cooke thinks the medical groups will prevail on the merits of their lawsuit.
Our present administration has a habit of blaming President George W. Bush for his own failed stimulus program initiated in 2009. However, during Bush’s eight years, 2001 to 2008, the average yearly national deficit was $251 billion. For the next four years, under Obama, it is estimated to be about $1.41 trillion a year.

"This seems to be more about a political agenda to have an opportunity to parade around the state collecting signatures to tarnish the reputation of the United States senator," Democratic State Chairman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex) said yesterday outside the courtroom. "Quite frankly, I’m not even certain that they really care about the ultimate outcome."
Under federal bribery statutes, prosecutors would have had to prove that Mr. Jetton took official action in direct return for the contribution. Mr. Jetton has denied any such quid-pro-quo. Without cooperating witnesses or a paper trail - factors that helped the feds make cases against three Democratic lawmakers last year - corruption cases are tough to make.
Don't count the small colleges out. Rudolph Chavez of the Cleveland Scholarship Programs says that while elite schools typically only offer aid based on family incomes, many quality private colleges lure top students with academic scholarships. Sometimes these awards make these colleges less expensive or equal to the cost of state schools.

If I were to create a cocktail that embodies Wicker Park, the nutty neighborhood I call home, it would be some combination of PBR, musician sweat and tattoo ink, with a splash of expensive beer and an artful garnish of skinny jeans and plaid.Thomas Kleiner had something else in mind. Challenged to concoct a drink that represents Wicker Park and Bucktown, the general manager of Club Lucky came up with a 10-ingredient allegory of the neighborhood’s ethnic history and summer activities, served with a participatory painting installation on the side.
Though the exact details of where Kevin ends up and how he gets there are not revealed at once, it is not hard to guess the destination early on. What holds us in the film, besides Ramsay's skill, is Swinton's fearless, ferocious performance as someone not only trying to come to terms with an endless nightmare but also agonizing over what part she might have had in its creation. The Oscar-winning Swinton's gifts are, of course, no secret, but this is a special performance, even for her.
Such a tough decision. The fact Bonds officially replaced Henry Aaron as home run king is a good enough reason to hate on him. But I think I have to vote for Roger Clemens, who is more offensive simply because he hasn't had the decency to shut up and disappear.
The most celebrated of the A's young guns is Jarrod Parker, a 23-year-old right-hander who came over from the Arizona Diamondbacks in the Cahill trade. Parker throws hard and has electric stuff when he's on, but he also missed the entire 2010 season after having Tommy John surgery.

Raskind is smart and thoughtful. Yes, he was in charge of National City Bank when it nearly went under, only to be gobbled up at a fire sale price by PNC in late 2008. But by the time Raskind took control, the bank was already in a death spiral and may have been well beyond saving.

"After the trade deadline my agent told me about four or five (general managers) called him and asked what was medically wrong with me because why wasn't I traded," Bell said. "Why wasn't I traded? What happened? Is it mentally, is it physical, is he the jerk? For an hour or two it was like I had this persona that I was hurt (or) that I was a bad clubhouse guy, that I was a bad teammate. That's far-fetched! That hurt me a little bit. That was the part that really hurt me."
NAM filed a petition this week asking the commission to delay Friday's launch to address manufacturers' concerns. The agency said it was still reviewing the petition.
"We're not foolish people. We're trying to represent the citizens the best we can," Reed said. During her long tenure, she said, she's differed with previous chiefs and mayors.

He said forced sex was a way to cover up his feelings of weakness. "For me, sex was my need. That's how I got it. ... It was all about getting my needs met, and not caring about anyone else's."
Neither is the Raiders' reputation for on-field mayhem presented with any kind of critical eye, whether it's the paralysis of New England's Darryl Stingley (a "completely legal" hit by Jack Tatum, the reader is told) or the concussions of Pittsburgh's Lynn Swann from Atkinson's forearm clubbings (simple retribution).
In Debbie's words: "One Christmas I found a bowling ball at a thrift shop, and my husband drilled a tiny hole and attached a key chain to it, thus a lovely key chain that you'd never in a million years lose. Well, it backfired. The girl who drew my 'gift' said her son had been wanting a bowling ball for ages and now she could give him one. She was thrilled. You just never know how it's going to turn out."
Salpointe led 2-0 after the first inning and 5-4 after the fourth inning, but Saguaro also did a good job of putting pressure on Salpointe and its starting pitcher, Jio Orozco, a freshman who was 4-0 with a 2.33 ERA.
Police arrested him in Berkeley on April 22, 1975, and he was taken to the St. Louis County Jail. However, he was suffering from heroin withdrawal, so he was taken to the State Hospital on Arsenal Street. He was only there a few days when he escaped custody by simply walking out.

Democratic Rep. Ted Strickland's decision to step down and run for governor has created primaries with multiple candidates for both major parties in this southeastern Ohio district. Republicans have targeted the district, which is culturally conservative, supported Bush narrowly in 2004, and shares traits with nearby West Virginia and Kentucky. Democrats, however, believe Republican scandals and Strickland's work give them an edge.
It's easy to pick just one area for an entire day's exploration or sample them all. Wander the downtown searching out boutiques, cafes and the Bankhead Theatre, compare vintage cabernets, slip in a round of golf or simply wander the hills.

To teach about inertia, select students were placed in Velcro body suits and jumped onto a giant sticky wall. Students got to drive gas-powered go-carts across the stage to illustrate action and reaction, and teachers battled each other in sumo wrestling to illustrate that force is determined by mass multiplied by acceleration. Soccer balls of varying size (mass) were also used to demonstrate that if mass increases, force must increase for acceleration to remain constant.
"It's a very diverse group of people," said Ladd. "I've been trying to think, 'If I lived in District 1, who would I vote for?'"
"You've got a full field of 20 horses and they'll all be nervous. None of them have run a mile and a quarter before, let alone in front of 140,000, a large number of whom will be screaming drunks," he added. "It stirs the imagination."
Even before those disturbances, hype over the shoes was growing, and around midnight, rumors started circulating that a teenager had been stabbed at the Wheaton Mall in Montgomery County.

Korach said there are related legal actions still up in the air, but declined to comment further.

Gin: Plymouth ($22, 750ml) wins out. It's a real gin, stands tall and proud with a goodly dash of perfume behind its ears, and it doesn't give you whiplash when you use it in a martini. It's also as versatile as all heck when used in cocktailian pursuits, so buy Plymouth if one brand of gin is all you need.
Romney, for his part, never misses an opportunity to blame Obama for what he labels as failed economic policies and bloated government, and to argue that the president's had his chance and now it's time for him to move on. He criticizes a jumble of "federal workforce training programs, 49 reporting to eight different agencies."

Carney said the review of the White House staff occurred last week, but would not discuss details. He complained that it was prompted in part because of rumors circulating on websites "with no editors and no conscience."
Of particular interest is the abundance of detail. World War I diaries describing the incompetence of those in command and the mind-numbing injuries sustained by men in the trenches make for compulsive reading. As do the accounts of the British approach to Tibet and the first sighting of Everest from the north in 1904 by Francis Younghusband, a European representing the British government in an expedition to Nepal. Younghusband took with him 5,000 soldiers, 10,000 porters, 20,000 yaks and 29 suitcases of personal effects. Their journey included camping out in one location for three months in sub-zero temperatures.

Celebrities will be flocking to Jersey City tonight to support the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society in finding a cure for cancer.
Mr. Santorum can't outrun his votes, and his big-picture strategy is arguably his best means of moving beyond them. That's why Michigan matters. The state will not prove decisive—this nomination fight will continue. The results could also be muddled by a Democratic campaign encouraging its party faithful to make mischief by voting in the GOP primary, for Mr. Santorum and for Ron Paul.
“My personal view is that there is no real need to increase base state aid,” he said. But he said schools can tap their reserves to increase their base state aid. That’s an idea that many school administrators say would drain savings and put them in a precarious financial situation, but it has support from conservatives who say school reserves have become bloated.

Most value investors would steer clear. But these companies enjoy astonishingly fat margins and buoyant cashflow. (Tiffany makes 58 cents of gross margin out of each dollar spent there.) Many have strong customer loyalty and economic moats. I'd rather be in the business of selling $500 handbags than buying them. Especially if the rich continue to get richer.
Three questions and one comment we get every year after our Women to Watch report comes out:
OTHERS SAY: "I'm a native Berliner," says real-estate lawyer Bernhard Falkenstein, "so it seems expensive to me. But if you come from Munich or Paris or Rome, it would seem very reasonable."

We got as close as we dared, and have the awesome photos to prove it, but I did fall once, despite Collins' careful steering and ready hand. I'm a sturdy gal, so it took both Hubby and Collins to get me up - I think I was the star of more than one tourist video that day. Hubby was very concerned … for the new digital camera I was holding at the time.
She hopes this garden, and a Southside collaboration with Waterman Farms, can evolve into a viable business for her gardeners. In addition, they grow foods familiar to their stomachs and engage in an agrarian activity that allows some of them to use skills that tie them to their old countries.

What's important for the future of the on-field product is where Rick Spielman, now officially the general manager, sees the Vikings.

The discussions never reached what the official termed "a formal stage," in part because of the release of the tapes prior to the San Francisco-New Orleans playoff game last year in which Williams urged his Saints' charges to test the injuries of several 49ers' players. The damning tape, the school executive said, "made (Williams) absolutely toxic," and the discussions never gained traction.

Swimming's Olympic trials don't begin until June 25 in Omaha, Neb. Franklin, who competed almost anonymously in three events at the 2008 trials at age 13, likely will swim both backstrokes, the 100 and 200 freestyles and possibly the 200 individual medley this time. She must finish in the top two to qualify for an individual event and most likely in the top six in the freestyles to be assured of a place in the relay pool.
The ill-fated Superjet was carrying dozens of representatives from local airlines and journalists on what was supposed to be a quick, 50-minute flight to the southern part of Java island and back.

Several other shops that line Areha's once-busy central square had walls of cinder blocks replacing glass storefronts, in preparation for another onslaught. There was good reason.
Maybe it’s because of the strangers that look at my son like he’s from mars when he flaps his arms or grinds his teeth in public and the ignorant individuals who raise their voices and almost yell at him when I inform them that he’s non-verbal. Maybe it’s the looks of pity I get from these same people who have no idea just how blessed I am to be Andrew’s mom.
Nowitzki, selected to his 11th All-Star Game, could see the trend clearly – a new wave of power forwards is emerging in the Western Conference, where the position has been dominated for years by perennial All-Stars led by San Antonio’s Tim Duncan.

The implied distinction between officially sanctioned (and thus acceptable) photography of enemy dead and unofficial (and thus unacceptable) portraiture is crucial. But in a conflict where soldiers have to do so much work at the interface of death and the visual, perhaps it should not come as a surprise that they might occasionally find it difficult to discern or tempting to ignore these distinctions in the field. Consider last year's scandal about the photographic exploits of the 'Kill Team' in Afghanistan. One of the pictures in that oeuvre shows the soldiers ostensibly following standard visual procedure, crouching over a boy's corpse to obtain scans of his iris and fingerprints. No doubt, countless soldiers have performed this analysis countless times on countless bodies. This particular action was recast as criminal by its inclusion in their grisly montage of displayed corpses and carefully composed shots of severed limbs. The event became extraordinary because someone documented it. The photograph, in which we see the dead boy's body refracted on the digital screen of the device that the soldier positions over him, made visible that which is usually invisible, the officially sanctioned visual work of the war.
