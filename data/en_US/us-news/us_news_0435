The more intrigued he becomes, the more insistent Robert is, though not necessarily with the patient's best interests at heart. He sees Christopher as a valuable case study for his wannabe career-making book on developing Afro-centric standards for diagnosing patients from the African diaspora. He's also bent on making his younger colleague pay for disrespecting his authority.
Each person who puts meat on a grill has a favorite way to turn pork steaks or chops into what is probably a family specialty. Much as I love it falling off the bone, sometimes meat gets a little chewy with long simmering in sauce.

The only power that I have ever had in a leadership job is the power that my people give to me. If they don't believe that I'm looking out for their interests, they're probably not going to give it to me.

That's true only if accomplishing solid legislation with minimum partisanship counts as poison. Graham may find that his constituents don't think so. Most Americans are ready for their elected representatives to act like adults.

Pages 200-203: Chamberlin notes an interesting statistic: Six of 10 people shot with a gun die, but eight of 10 people attacked with a knife die. A juror asks about police guns and is told they have either a Glock 17 or a Glock 19, both 9-millimeter weapons. The juror asks if the guns would just knock the person down. Chamberlin answers: "That's totally a Hollywood misconception. Guns will never knock you backwards." Could you keep walking after being shot, a juror asks. "Oh, absolutely, yeah. And many people do," Chamberlin answers. Moawad paraphrases criticism around firearm use, with the question why didn't the officer shoot to maim versus shooting to kill. Why aren't officers trained to shoot the knife out of someone's hand? Chamberlin: "Because that is an extremely difficult task to accomplish. To hit a moving target is hard enough." A juror asks how police are trained to deal with someone who wants to commit "suicide by cop." Chamberlin says if they know that is the type of call they are dealing with police would keep their distance and call in special units.

If Iran continues to inch toward the bomb, our policy should take a page from how the international community has handled North Korea the past two decades. The first Bush administration believed that Pyongyang probably had one or two bombs, yet neither President George H.W. Bush nor President Bill Clinton threatened war over that capability. In 1994, however, when North Korea threatened to reprocess plutonium for more bombs and build large reactors that could create the material for several dozen a year, Defense Secretary William Perry was emphatic that a North Korean nuclear arsenal could not be tolerated. His warning was heard loud and clear in Pyongyang, and the agreed framework resulted.

The United States already has a strategy that will phase out the war effort, Obama noted, one that calls for the return of 23,000 troops by the end of this summer. Obama set a goal of a steady withdrawal of troops until the international forces completely turn over responsibility to Afghan officials by the end of 2014, and his advisors are now trying to figure out what that means in actual numbers.

Finally, plenty of Oregon parents and teachers still believe in the value of basic language skills. Employers crave workers who can draw up handwritten signs, job estimates, menus, paper receipts and quick notes without embarrassing spelling errors.

Millionaire players with a billionaire owner scold us for not sharing our depleted entertainment budgets with them, when they ply their trade in a state-of-the-art building we taxpayers financed. We gave them the arena in exchange for their paying the operating cost, and now we're paying the operating cost as well. They said it was too much for them and they'd sure hate to leave town, and we said OK.

What remains of a center in Republican ranks is also being targeted by the tea party in primary challenges this spring to generally conservative longtime Sens.

In his commentary in the Baltimore Sun ("End the MTA Monopoly," April 14), Professor James Dorn of Towson University, and the Cato Foundation whose journal he edits, would have us privatize our public transportation. Dorn characterizes the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) as a monopoly, without mentioning the scores of private transportation providers (vans, shuttles, taxis, etc.), including the massive French multinational corporation Veolia, which already co-exist with the MTA right here in the Baltimore region. But, granting the MTA's preeminent position in our regional transportation picture, what are the implications of what Dorn's suggestion? What could this mean for the present and future transit- riding public?

The Obama administration's challenge to the Arizona immigration statute SB1070 is not about its popularity, or whether the statute is wise or unwise policy. Legislatures are permitted to enact laws thought unpopular or unwise by others. And as Chief Justice Roberts observed, and the administration's lawyer agreed, the challenge is also not in any way about civil rights or racial profiling.
At high school track meets, coach Jackie Harris entered Wilson in as many as seven events to not only win, but also to counter his energy and acrobatics, which he shows off in a 21-back-flip routine now on YouTube.
Keane cooks at a phenomenal culinary pitch. He alternates between complex combinations and those that seem simple. The secret is that he knows how to blend surprising flavors to maximum effect; one of the small appetizers he sends out between courses, for example, spotlights the first-of-the-season porcini. He places the mushrooms on creamed corn made by using corn milk from fresh kernels and swirling in butter and herbs. He encircles it with a sauce made with veal, white wine, port and dried porcini to reinforce the power of the main ingredient. Nothing about the dish is exotic, but the elements waltz across the tongue, taking that final bow with a sip of 2002 Skewis Bush Vineyard Pinot Noir.
Tommy Rees is just finishing his sophomore year. He still could be a worthy starting quarterback for Notre Dame. That could happen. After Thursday, it may be that Brian Kelly can't risk the steep price to pay if it doesn't.
Beer Guy: Take one of two paths at Smashburger - order a "signature" burger with predetermined ingredients, or create your own, choosing from various buns, cheeses and toppings - and you're unlikely to go astray. The toppings are ones you'd actually want to have on a burger (read: no minced garlic), and adding a fried egg to my patty was the best $1 decision I made all week. This was a fresh, flavorful burger that I'd gladly eat again and again. The fries: Smashburger's regular shoestring fries were addictive enough; tossing them in olive oil, rosemary and garlic took these fast-food spuds to a new level.

Let's match up Herman Cain vs Bob Dole. Like George H.W. Bush, Dole was a war hero, a member of the Kansas House of Representatives, elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, became a senator, was selected as a vice-presidential running mate, and chaired the Republican National Committee. He later went on to serve as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senate majority leader, and Senate minority leader. Herman can't even make an edible pizza. Republican or not -- you have to admit, that stuff was pretty bad.

Graham, who was signed by the Ravens on Dec. 21 with Cundiff dealing with a left calf injury, was 2-for-2 on field-goal attempts in a 20-14 victory over the Cleveland Browns in Week 15, converting from 48 and 43 yards out along with making both of his extra points.

Penn's David Asch, a medical doctor, Wharton M.B.A. and executive director of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, complimented the Dartmouth leaders, but is proud of Penn's approach.

Since he disappeared from Ohio, there have been clues that Bartoli was heading for Peru. In 2000, U.S. marshals seized Peruvian travel documents in Bartoli's name when he was briefly detained in Littleton, N.H., in connection with the Cyprus Funds civil case. According to the terms of the warrant, Bartoli was freed after surrendering his U.S. passport. It was the last time he was seen in the United States.

Footwear: Wear heavier shoes on days you'll be traveling to or from a warmer climate (and it's always a good idea to wear your heaviest footwear on the plane, no matter what the occasion. This saves weight in your suitcase and creates space for souvenirs. Dress boots are my personal go-to form of footwear, while my husband favors casual dress shoes with plenty of tread to handle snowy parking lots with hidden patches of ice. Beachy flip-flops for the warmer end of the trip pack easily for both men and women, as do a variety of soft adventure sandals. These can double as your slippers, by the way. And note to those people who need arch support: You can find good-looking sandals and flip-flops that provide that.

• Shaw already out-recruiting Harbaugh -- Jack Blanchat, The Stanford Daily: Shaw has put together a recruiting class that is much deeper than just two studs — the Cardinal’s 2012 recruiting class contains nine four-star recruits. A class that is both that talented and deep means that the Cardinal can count on one class to fill in for departing starters (or significant contributors) right away. Considering that Stanford will lose half of its starters to graduation or the NFL this year, it’s nice to know that a big group of talented players can come in and fill those gaps.

Niccolini thinks that Italy didn't fight the seizure in court for economic reasons — and because it didn't want to be branded a hypocrite. The moral high ground it enjoys in its fight to repatriate looted antiquities might crumble a bit were it to be seen clinging to a painting stolen during the Holocaust.
I wandered down my old block last week, shaking hands with neighbors I hadn't seen in years, dodging the tricycles owned by the children of the people whose tricycles I had dodged 20 years ago. The neo-Georgian four-plexes were freshly painted, and the cooking smells drifting across the lawns seemed to be basically the same ethereal blend of kimchi, chile and grilling meat — not unlike a Kogi truck drawn out to the length of a city block. It wasn't home any longer, but it felt as if it could be.
"He's handled himself like a true professional," Bird said in March. "He's been around coaches that's had experience and had success in this league and he's learned a lot.

Kuechly and Upshaw will likely have the most significant roles for their respective teams next year. Look for both to be Week 1 starters.

There’s been some talk this could be a funky first round with some surprises through the middle part, so we’re not even sure the Giants could project their pick at this point. But we’ll give it a shot, using their pre-draft visits and meetings as a guide for positions and players who might be targets. And we’ll lean toward best potential athletes available because natural ability is what lands a player high on the Giants’ draft board.

The desert fern and golden leadball are moderate growers, while mulga can be slow.

But with the state’s entire $1.2 billion — and growing — debt unlikely to be forgiven, the Republican governor and Democratic lawmakers will have to arrive at a plan that would continue to fund benefits.

Gov.Martin O'Malleyhas been trying to convince Marylanders since January that a tax increase on gasoline in our state is a good thing. And that is just this year.

There's also a difference between a one-time petition and ongoing parental involvement with schools. According to Austin, one major reason that so few parents enrolled their students in the Celerity charter school is the neighborhood's transience; many families moved out of the area before the new school year started. It's a familiar scenario; in the Los Angeles Unified School District, about a quarter of the students move every year. But it also raises questions about whether a petition signed by parents should have the power to invoke such major, permanent change when many of the people who sign it will be gone by the time it takes effect.
"Yeeees," the students rang out together before giving Karley Jo a round of applause.
"Barack Obama is an ethical man and a philosophically confused man," said Peruvian congresswoman Martha Chavez, a member of the conservative Catholic Opus Dei movement.

The race weekend was outwardly a success. Some 160,000 people attended the three days of trial heats and races, and if the impact was nowhere near as high as organizers promised, the $47 million boost to the local economy wasn't insignificant either. Hotel rooms were booked in what otherwise might have been a slow weekend, some restaurants in the area of the race did well (though others, not as well as they had expected), and spectators generally reported having a great time.

I took on a lot of odd jobs to pay for my classes at Cleveland State, including one where I helped set up and break down for a jazz concert in CSU's gym. I was the only female on the crew, and the guys pretty much ignored me until they were dismantling a heavy spotlight after the concert. I realized that if they unscrewed one more bolt, the light would go crashing to the floor, so I leapt forward and stopped it from falling. I earned all of $15 for that day but got a job offer as a roadie from the jazz group.

* A rash of new newspapers will sprout up all over, stealing millions of readers and advertisers from the Internet.
Plenty of brand new garments, shoes, and accessories are beautifully made and will last for decades. Plenty more are cheaply constructed and monstrously overpriced. All it takes is a spin through a thrift store handling older goods to see how manufacturing policies and practices have changed over time. Clothes from bygone eras are heavier, better designed, crafted from better materials, and built to last. When you buy a used garment from a thrift store, you may end up with a more durable, quality product than you would if you bought new. (Emphasis on "may," especially if you're buying recent goods ... but still!) Are you an avid thrifter? Why do you think thrifting is a fabulous way to stay fashionable? Image via weheartit.

Tellingly, on the drama side, the word retains more of its original sting. Maria Bello's detective on NBC's now-defunct "Prime Suspect" was on the receiving end, and though the word wound up tarring user more than recipient, it was still clearly meant as a vicious insult, for which there is no male counterpart.
Unfortunately, I am more than $25,000 in debt. I have been a long-standing owner of two Bank of America cards. I have never been late or missed a payment.

You can also cut back on costs by meal sharing  many restaurants serve meals that are too large for most of us to eat at one time. By splitting an appetizer and an entree, you can still enjoy a great meal, but at half the cost. You might also look for two-for-one deals and other specials to keep your dining costs to a minimum.
In the second, our travelers are touched and frightened when they hear a group of runaway slaves who have been captured and are being marched back (the fate that Jim risks). As Jim and the prisoners sing "Crossin' Over," a song that promises freedom in heaven if not on Earth, the row of shadowed figures in chains moves slowly across the "hills" at the back of the stage while Jim, on the raft, expresses his solidarity with them in song.

After the fall of communism in 1989, the Czech Republic wanted to be a normal European country again as soon as possible, after being excluded from participating in the post-World War II European integration process for 41 years. The only way to achieve this was to become a member country of the European Union. We had no other choice, but the communist experience was still too "fresh." We wanted to be free and didn't want to lose our freedom and our finally regained sovereignty. Many of us were therefore in favor of a looser form of European integration, against the so-called deepening of the EU and against the creation of political union in Europe. People like me understood very early that the idea of a European single currency is a dangerous project which will either bring big problems or lead to the undemocratic centralization of Europe. My position was clear: With all my reservations, we had to apply for EU membership, but at the same time we had to fight against projects such as the euro.

The same effort and energy he put into locating Phylicia Barnes, you can see him doing the same for his daughter. That's the kind of cop we want to patrol the streets of Baltimore."
Travelocity declined to comment on the Minnesota ruling, because it was not party to the settlement. (The online agency made its decision about opt-out marketing in consultation with the travel insurance companies, but the insurers approved the way in which their products were sold, according to Travelocity.)

D'Silva's instruction is solid and soothing as he guides you to "yawn it out" in more strenuous postures and conducts period body awareness checks to make sure you're in alignment.
Flynn’s term on the PVSC expired in 2008, but he remained as a holdover appointment because those named to replace him have been blocked through senatorial courtesy, the unwritten but strictly enforced rule giving state senators veto power over nominees from their legislative districts. Girgenti last year single-handedly blocked the appointment of a Passaic County nominee who was expected to take Flynn’s place on the commission.

Royal Khyber certainly has a long history in Orange County, and has made some creative menu adaptations. But in all, I found the food largely unexceptional for the price. In retrospect, I probably should have gone with the anniversary special, which is still being offered: a three-course meal and a glass of wine for $30.
"I don't hold too much to it; it was 20 at-bats (with the Tigers)," Inge said after the Athletics' 11-6 loss to Boston, in which he went 1-for-3 with two lineouts while batting eighth. "There's not a lot there. I'm basically starting over right now."

When we initially saw the customer sign-up goals, I thought they were pretty aggressive. I remember biting my lip, saying, "This is going to be tough challenge." Actually, we exceeded the goal in January.
James remains the most gifted player in basketball, a freakish combination of athleticism, size and strength that is virtually unstoppable when the jumper is falling. He's also one of the game's top defenders, willing and capable of checking four different positions. Durant, meanwhile, is the game's best pure scorer and an underrated defender who can use his length to make things very difficult in the half-court.
Regis 10, Cardinal Hayes 4: Matt Dieffenbach gave up no earned runs in seven innings and Tommy Gorman had a double, triple and two RBIs for Regis (2-2). Julien Machuca had a three-RBI triple to break a 4-all tie in the sixth and Peter Finch drove in a pair of runs. Hayes is 2-4.

This would be a costly move up from No. 16 for the Jets, although it won't be as drastic as the Atlanta Falcons jumping up 21 spots last year. The odds are probably against the Jets making such a move, but you can't discount it because the Jets have moved up in the past.

A: Arborvitae is not a recommended plant for the lower deserts. Back in the 1930s, they were planted by builders from California in flood-irrigated yards. Back then people were not of the mind-set to plant desert plants. Today, there are a few remnants. This is a high-maintenance plant and is highly vulnerable to spider mites -- especially if the plant is stressed by our hot, dry conditions. You will have to continually spray this tree to keep it in shape and water it frequently during the summer months. I would suggest planting a broad-leaved evergreen tree such as the Texas ebony instead.
There are no known cures for multiple sclerosis though existing drugs do help with symptoms, decrease the frequency of relapses and slow progression of the disease. But all of them have side effects, some worse than others.
Rick Taft, a lawyer and longtime councilman in Pepper Pike, refers to himself as an "intensely pragmatic" public policy wonk. One of his passions has been health care reform -- he wrote and self-published a tome on the topic in the early 1990s.

Despite its title, "Architecture of the Sun" touches only lightly on the connections between climate and architecture. If the book aims to make an argument, it is in favor — to use the terms borrowed by Hines from the scholar Miles Orvell — of "the culture of authenicity" over "the culture of imitation," which is to say Hines consistently celebrates modernism's forward-looking innovation while revealing deep reservations about revivalist and historicist styles of all sorts. He opens the door a bit to let in the Art Deco and Streamline Moderne architecture of the 1920s and '30s, and the Googie coffee shops of the 1950s, but architects who actively mined historical references — Julia Morgan, to name one — are nowhere to be found.
In October, Russo made a presentation to the Redwood Coast Energy Authority, an agency that works with local government in Humboldt County on energy efficiency projects.

The female option is not generating much juice in political circles. For example, last month the Washington Post blog "The Fix" posted its "Top 10" vice presidential picks. Only one woman made the list: Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico. In 2010, she made history as the nation's first Latina governor. She could be a two-fer, drawing Latinos and a key swing state. However, like Palin, she is unknown and untried.
"The reason we did this is because we believe in the academy," Sanabria said. "This past year, all of us were left out in the lurch -– all of the people eliminated in terms of 31 categories. You can’t have 6,000 musicians competing for one Grammy. You could, theoretically have that, but it’s just unfair. For example, the traditional roots music category is about six different genres of music, and you have Latin jazz competing against traditional jazz and contemporary jazz. It’s ridiculous. It devalues the music."
