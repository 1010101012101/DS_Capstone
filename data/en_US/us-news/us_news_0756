Yuma Territorial Prison State Park: The prison opened in 1876 and held 3,069 prisoners, including 29 women, for crimes ranging from murder to grand larceny during its 33 years of operation. The prison has been featured in books, movies and television shows and was notorious for its rough clientele, its blistering summer heat and its perch on a bluff overlooking the Colorado and Gila rivers, making escapes difficult. However, records show that the prison was a model institution for its time, with punishment limited to dark cells for prisoners who broke the rules. Visitors can step inside the cells, get a look at the main gate and guard tower and see exhibits on the prison’s history. Website: http://www.pr.state.az.us/Parks/parkhtml/yuma.html

We are so used to talking to the people we are talking to, writing to the people we are writing to, and adjust ourselves accordingly - relaxed and jesting with friends, polite to strangers, affectionate to our loved ones.

That was a brutal week for Baylor. There’s no shame in losing games to Kansas and Missouri, two top-10 teams, but the Bears weren’t even close in the last 10 minutes of either contests.

The substitution of olive oil for butter goes beyond touting a heart-healthier fat. While butter can melt into the background of many desserts, which is exactly what you want it to do, olive oil adds a stand-out fruity richness.

The system's basic parameters were set by the Federal Highway Act of 1921, which presented a distinctively American vision of a national system defined by local requirements. The act reflected the convictions of Thomas MacDonald, head of the federal Office of Public Roads and a classic Progressive Era technocrat who believed in engineering plans based on research.

"Just think about it: How many parents tell their kids, 'You know what, when you grow up, you should be a machinist,' " said Astro President Mike Watts Jr., who runs a company his father founded 35 years ago. "What they don't realize is that our people are using college skills. It's so different from when my grandfather ran a machine in a smoky, dirty shop."

During the first part of the 20th century, when Greater Cleveland's population and wealth were soaring, governments proliferated. Cuyahoga County now has 59 municipalities and 31 school districts. Voters tolerated redundancy to enjoy autonomy. They could afford it.
Brett Hammond, head of index research at MSCI, says the emerging-markets index is designed for high liquidity and low trading costs, and that Korea and Taiwan still resemble emerging markets.
Many others seem to agree. Russ Tilleman, a 52-year-old retired engineer and self-described activist, worked briefly to assist the movement with its media relations until a couple of the more radical people inside the camp threatened his life repeatedly. He now only shows up with friends who can help him out if he's threatened again. It was Tilleman who helped defend a young photography student who was at the movement to document the faces of some of the protesters. The student was also threatened and had to leave. These are not isolated incidents.

I've attended the Disney Vacation Club presentation here in Orlando, and it's a pretty impressive program. Disney offers a lot of properties, and the rates were reasonable enough that I even considered buying in. Why didn't I? Like a lot of Americans, I don't have nearly enough vacation time to use it.
Sony is aiming for a comeback under Kazuo Hirai, appointed president last month, who has headed the gaming division and built his career in the U.S.
The city, however, once enjoyed a better reputation. The iconic postwar family television series "Leave it to Beaver" referred to June Cleaver as the "belle of East St. Louis" in an episode that aired in 1961. Just a year before that, the city had been labeled by Look Magazine and the National Municipal League as an "All-America City." The magazine ranked the city ahead of Honolulu and Burbank, Calif., on its list of the nation's most progressive communities.

They arrived with few belongings other than a small bag, a large cardboard box, a few sandwiches and an old accordion given him as a birthday gift by a wealthy aunt. And they were lucky: After three months in the unspecified camp, a German guard who enjoyed listening to Weissenberg play Schubert on the accordion helped them escape by train.
"They asked me if I wanted to play and my answer was I was too old for that. It was too dangerous," Foster said from the caddie tent, crutches at his side. "I was just there to watch. Before the match, they were kicking the ball around, like I do at home with my boys. I stretched, and as soon as I planted, my knee collapsed. I heard it rip and crack, and I knew I was in trouble."

In a study published March 15 in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers from UH Seidman Cancer Center and five other institutions identified changes in three genes (two mutations and one translocation, or movement of part of one gene to another gene) in AML patients. The gene changes may explain why some people are more likely to benefit from higher doses of chemotherapy -- and have longer survival rates -- than others who were given standard doses.

And waiting for them in a private area of the President’s Club at the Continental Airlines terminal was Booker, trying to close the deal of his life.
That's how playoff hockey rolls. Leave nothing behind, not even brain cells.
And I was impressed with what I saw. I learned about a situation that is devastating children in the far-off land of Uganda. Prior to the watching the video, I had known NOTHING about it. I saw a filmmaker making smart use of social media to educate others like me. I was reminded of how much I take for granted living where and how I do, comfortable that my children will wake up every day to a home, food, education and an intact family.
It’s a dilemma tax professionals across the nation are facing as they enter the year-end planning season. With just two months before the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts expire — and Congress postponing a vote on the issue until after next month’s midterm elections — accountants don’t know whether to plan on current tax rates, a return to old rates, or a mix of both.
High school senior Jabari Alvarango has had a difficult life. His father was deported when he was five. His mother died of cancer when he was 14.
I went back to heaven -- and that smell -- two Saturdays ago. Frank Wrenick, a retired lawyer, invited me to join the all-volunteer work force at the Military Air Preservation Society museum at the Akron-Canton Airport.
Yet, despite the reality that the same could likely be said of hunters, skiers, mountain bikers, backpackers, kayakers and even gardeners, there is some relevance offered in the report by the group that brings us AnglerSurvey.com. It's not only worthwhile examining the reason why anglers do and don't fish, but perhaps it's time some former fishermen — along with those who benefit from seeing them return — re-examine their priorities.
He should. In 1971, the Democratic councilman supported Republican Ralph Perk's winning campaign for mayor of Cleveland. A significant part of Perk's strategy was to label one of his main opponents, wealthy businessman James Carney, a "carpetbagger." Carney had moved to the city from the western suburbs solely to run for mayor.

Last month, Erickson said it hoped to raise around $65 million by selling stock for between $13 and $15 a share. Today, though, the company said it expects to sell fewer shares for less money.
Now the administration may also be able to argue that what it is doing is working and no aggressive targeting of suspected border jumpers by local police is necessary. Nevertheless, President Obama's attorneys will be fighting the usual uphill battle against the court's conservative majority. Those five justices have already upheld another Arizona statute that revokes the business license of any employer who knowingly hires illegals. When their ruling comes down in June, it will not be surprising if they also decide in favor of the states' right to round up suspicious characters with brown skin and Spanish surnames and demand to see their papers.

"This is really an honor," he said, referring to being nominated for the Prep Hall of Fame. "I enjoyed playing sports, every since I was seven years old, trying to keep up with my brothers. I had a good career. I played with some baseball hall of famers. It all started in Pacifica."
Concerns about PG&E's manual valves date at least three decades to a gas leak in San Francisco that led to federal calls for the utility to improve its system. The subject is sure to receive attention from Sacramento to Washington, D.C., as investigators struggle to find out why the pipeline suddenly blew on Thursday, killing at least four people and incinerating 37 houses. Three people are still listed as missing.
Hirst’s wife works at the ShopRite in Evesham and helps her husband with the bookwork and finance side of things. Noting a $23,000 loan to pay utilities and Hirst only having half of a day off each week, the couple are exhausted.

About 1,200 foods at the Dave's on Carroll Avenue near West 25th Street and on Payne Avenue now have the Go! Food labels. The designation doesn't raise the price of the food -- it just identifies it as a healthy choice.
The Cottonwood Canyon Trail, part of the 750-mile Arizona Trail, shows off Arizona's diversity as it travels from the lower canyon at Roosevelt Lake to its upper portion near the northern end of the Superstition Mountains. As soon as the trail enters the craggy chasm, hikers can see how the forces of erosion have chewed through conglomerate walls, left boulders strewn along the stream bed and lodged twigs and limbs in rock crevices.
Data posted by three other drugmakers so far has not been so user-friendly, said Allan Coukell, director of the Pew Prescription Project, a consumer group focused on safety and access to information about prescription drugs. He said other companies also have not disclosed data on payments for working on patient drug tests.
Filmmakers Jon and Andrew Erwin, faith-film vets, are more interested in backdoor references to faith than advancing the plot: "They were praying people, I remember." A sympathetic cop paraphrases Baptist dogma — "Hate the crime, not the criminal."
Some have been from doctors and other health care professionals involved in diabetes care or the treatment of various ailments associated with metabolic syndrome, and some of these have offered help and resources to get the word out about the benefits of good diet and exercise.
One of my former co-workers used to tease me that wherever we were in the St. Louis area, I always knew how to find the nearest fresh doughnut, and in many neighborhoods that was true. If we were on Gravois in Affton, Federhofer's bakery was close by. Being around Watson and Laclede Station Road called for a stop at Lubeley's. Deeper in South County, the place to go was The Donut Stop on Lemay Ferry. Kirkwood meant McArthur's, even though I'm one of the old-timers who still call it Kirkwood Bakery.

"The university balked at first, but eventually they came around. They thought it was cool."
The firing of teachers is a politically and emotionally fraught issue, which is why the state has been deadlocked for years on how to fix the process. These bills contain some ideas worth discussing, but they fail to outline an approach that is reasonable, timely and fair to both sides.
Like Lake Independence, Bass Lake in Marinette County had a phosphorus problem. Most of the sport fish died because two dairy farms dumped so much of the chemical into the lake between 1970 and 1990. County, state and federal agencies spent about $700,000 to restore the 37-acre lake and its fishery between 1986 and 2000.

HAPPY VALLEY POLICE
It's not a crime to owe money, and debtors' prisons were abolished in the United States in the 19th century. But people are routinely being thrown in jail for failing to pay debts. In Minnesota, which has some of the most creditor-friendly laws in the country, the use of arrest warrants against debtors has jumped 60 percent over the past four years, with 845 cases in 2009, a Star Tribune analysis of state court data has found.
The Giants passed over Georgia guard/tackle Cordy Glenn, who unexpectedly slipped out of the first round. Reese said there were a few players the team was considering and they also tried to get “the mother lode” in a trade. They were never close to moving up, though.
Before the game, Penner said he was "role playing," pretending it was the Kings that had dropped Game 1 at home and had that feeling of desperation.
"The Girl Scouts are being used to sell another unhealthy product," says registered dietitian Hope Warshaw. "A product that has the halo of youth on it ought to be something healthy."
Things move more slowly in the South, and that’s a boon to the cuisine, says Jesse Jones, who grew up in tiny Snow Hill, N.C., and now runs a “New Carolina” catering business in Essex County. That patience, he says, allows cooks to develop a great depth of flavor — and the traditional building blocks of Southern cooking — butter, buttermilk, salt pork, bacon — don’t hurt, either. (Well, a cardiologist may differ on that point.)
But given the current climate in which 47 states are struggling with revenue shortfalls, the federal government may be more open to waivers, state officials said.
A Durbin aide, who would only speak about the case on the condition his name wasn't used, said the office did make the Department of Homeland Security aware of the case.
Law enforcement is often reactive, but San Jose's gang prevention task force meets monthly to talk about emerging community problems and trends, such as escalating high school dropout rates.
That's in part because soliciting money from big donors is more cost-efficient. With a few phone calls, well-connected donors can raise thousands of additional dollars, while getting the same amount from small givers requires substantial investments in direct mail, phone banking and email lists.
"What it means in a nutshell is that we blew 8 million jobs out of the economy and we've brought back maybe 3 million," he said. "You have larger numbers of people dropping out of the labor market involuntarily. You have large numbers of people working part-time who want to work full-time. You have large numbers of people who are losing financial position and status when they are re-employed.
In Tower Grove South, bars are scrutinizing their revenue figures to see how they match city requirements, said Denny Domachowski, manager of Friendly's Sports Bar & Grill, on Roger Place. Friendly's is OK, he said. It sells plenty of $1.50 brats, but many more $10 buckets.
"I've got all brothers," Miller said with a chuckle. "I like to play rough. I enjoyed the physicality of it."
Last year, investigators were flummoxed over a salmonella outbreak that started with one case in Oregon in July and then grew, adding clusters of cases across the country.

Some biologists believe the proposal won't work. More barred owls, perhaps hundreds, would have to be killed every year to keep the study areas free of interlopers for three to 10 years. One biologist estimated the cost at up to $1 million annually.
Last year, Hamels was a pitcher the team left behind in Florida for a month, as he says, "So I didn't have to deal with this cold. Experiencing it for the last couple of days, I'm happy to go back to Florida . . . It's just something you have to get used to - it's part of the job. When you get out on the field, you don't worry about the temperature - you worry about the game."

Dean moved to L.A., and Ishmael folded, giving Valenzuela time for another project. But cellphone numbers were misplaced, and Valenzuela and Taylor did not meet again until both showed up to see Bay Area violin-and-cello metal outfit Judgement Day a few years ago at the Press Club.
Like boils, HS is an inflammatory condition that is characterized by small or large tender, red nodules that erupt beneath the surface of the skin. The areas most affected are the underarms, the groin and the perineum. Eventually, the lesions start to drain and to emit a foul odor. Scars form, as tunnels are created below the skin from one abscess to another.
"I want a permanent place,'' Lewis said. "I have decided that I am not going to even try other parks. I am working with a church group here that has some property and I am going to work with the school district to see if we can put a community garden on school property.''
"This inexperienced, poor, little scared 16-year-old kid hit all five times," Chief Assistant State Attorney Bruce Bartlett told the jury. "Lindsey turns and points and fires. He fires and he fires and he fires. Nicholas Lindsey hit David Crawford five times.
McMillan is a prideful man. He's a man of principles. It's why he bolted Seattle for Portland six seasons ago, and you can already sense that he's wondering what more he needs to do to demonstrate he deserves an extension. This Blazers organization can be bone-headed, clumsy and stubborn, can't it?
Brianna Butler, an outfielder/first baseman, led the Knights in hitting last season with a .526 average. She compiled a 9-1 mark with a 2.42 ERA, but Darrell Butler says she will not pitch this spring.

The retiree moved into a small, stone home in the unincorporated area 35 miles northwest of Phoenix. Rather than decorate or purchase lots of furniture, Touboul started filling her home with cats.
Government cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity. It cannot tax the rich into creating jobs for the middle-class or poor. A job is a voluntary transaction that betters both parties. Very few people — including Robin Hood wannabe Warren Buffett, who made $63 million last year — choose to pay taxes voluntarily.
In recent years, the citizen-run Portland Utility Review Board has cautioned the city to keep water and sewer fees to no more than what it costs to deliver services. Water customers already pay for the city's iconic Benson Bubblers and to supply water features in parks, totaling about $1 million a year.

“We need someone to go out and take the president on on the big issues of the day and there’s no bigger issue than Obamacare,” he told hundreds of supporters and students earlier in the day at a Christian school in Miamisburg, Ohio, a suburb of Dayton. "I’ve never been for a government mandate, state or federal. I’ve never said government is going to solve the healthcare problem. Government is the healthcare problem.”
Today is Goosen's last chance to qualify for the Masters.
“When you’re touring this place, you see maybe 5 percent of the entire collection,” the curator explained. “That’s a common ratio in the museum world. People can only see so much in one day. So you change things up and try to keep them new.”
As the first African American elected to represent New Jersey in the United States Congress, Donald Payne was a civil rights pioneer and trailblazer. He dedicated most of his professional life to serving the public, providing strong representation and working hard to improve his constituents’ quality of life. He also was an international figure who campaigned tirelessly for human rights and raised awareness about the human tragedies in Africa. Today is a sad day because we have lost a statesman, we have lost a gentleman and we have lost a friend.
Some of the orations are potent accounts of the terrible toll of internecine war. Some push a love-hate theme with the subtlety of Robert Mitchum's fists in "The Night of the Hunter." But almost all go on too long, leaving too many other characters standing around with nothing to do.
He said that if he has any regret, it's that he phoned Aubuchon instead of showing up in person. He couldn't leave work on one of the busiest nights of the year at Tony's - the Saturday before Valentine's Day.
Lab services and equipment are being built into the emergency room, eliminating the need to cart patients up and down the hall. That should make for quicker diagnoses and swifter treatments, enabling UH to cut wait times, said Dr. Fred Rothstein, president of UH Case Medical Center. "Walking into the physical space is going to be shocking to people who are living in sort of a cramped space in our emergency department today," he said.

Several board members disagree with Anderson’s plan to re-configure new schools while closing facilities.
Among the unresolved questions: When does the government need a search warrant or a subpoena to investigate your online self? How should the government be able to obtain information about you from third parties such as phone companies or social networking sites? How much should your privacy protections depend on Google's business strategies -- or on the whims of the 27-year-old Facebook CEO?

Our advice: Schedule an appointment for your sister with a rheumatologist, a physician who specializes in conditions that affect joints, muscles or bones. You need a sensitive, smart doctor to guide your sister through the treatment options. Contact a fibromyalgia treatment network to find a specialist in your area.

These temporarily ease the hurt. Some have used Lyrica (pregabalin), which is approved for pain from damaged nerves.

Smith has led the Knicks reserves in scoring, totaling 30 points in the two playoff games, not a bad effort considering part of his duties has included guarding LeBron James.
James does make a compelling case for why, like William Godwin's "Caleb Williams" (1794), Wilkie Collins' "The Moonstone" (1868) and the work of Arthur Conan Doyle and Edgar Allan Poe, Jane Austen's "Emma" should be considered an early example of the detective story: "Here the secret which is the mainspring of the action is the unrecognized relationships between the limited number of characters . . . Austen deceives us with cleverly constructed clues . . . at the end, when all becomes plain and the characters are at last united with their right partners, we wonder how we could have been so deceived."

To put it simply, when he's right Wainwright will stop allowing home runs. He's been getting too much of the middle of the zone with too many of his pitches and that has led to damage being done. He's already allowed 5 home runs in 13 2/3 innings. Compare that to 2010 when he allowed 15 home runs in 230 innings and you see the stark difference.

Hales: I'm going to take a very incisive approach to the city budget because we have to put more dollars to the bottom line of real basic city services, and control overhead and administration. So my staff will be smaller than the current mayor's staff. Mayor Katz had 12 staff positions. Mayor Adams has 24. I won't have 24. But I will have one of those staff who is a key player and credible in the arts community. Whether or not that person will have other responsibilities in addition to arts? I don't know yet. We're a long way from picking staff, after all. But when I was a city commissioner I always had someone in my office who was a key liaison to the arts, even though I didn't always have the Regional Arts & Culture Council as one of my bureau assignments. So I'll do likewise this time.

Moviegoers — young (the summer staple) and old (increasingly coming back to the five-and-dime, Jimmy Dean…) — want a constant flow. The idea that audiences are more intrigued, or less pressed in the summertime, or that there are movie mood swings tied to weather patterns anymore is just downright silly. We are a totally wired nation of want it all, all the timers.
Nationally, images of African-American men are conveyed through sports, entertainment, social reforms and crime stories, not through direct experience. Statistically, Cleveland has been one of the most segregated cities in America for several years.
Community violence is a sickness in Philadelphia. It's a sickness in Detroit. Myriad communities, urban and rural and tribal, across this country are suffering. Research shows that more than 60% of children were exposed to violence over one year, either directly or indirectly.

Even the mega-projects that succeed on one level are hard to justify as economic engines. Built in 1995, the $280 million Edward Jones Dome - paid for entirely by taxpayers - brought Rams football to town. Cardinals fans seem to enjoy the new Busch Stadium, which received $88 million of public money. But economists say professional sports don't generate many direct or indirect jobs.
Sometimes, as an opposing forward bears down on him, the brain's natural instinct is stop-the-puck-stop-the-puck-stop-the-puck. Lidstrom is poised enough, and skilled enough, to look in the player's eyes.

Joe was well known in the local youth and high school wrestling communities. Many will remember him being mat-side at Flemington Elks wrestling matches or in the bleachers at Hunterdon Central High School matches. Fulfilling his passion for music, Joe played the cello in the Livingston Symphony Orchestra for over 20 years.
"It's cool that we've been attracting different generations to our music," said Sipe. "We get to play to older 'A Prairie Home Companion' fans, and to kids in college or kids from jam-band festivals. There's something magical about the appeal of American roots music."

Platform Timberland terrible: Robyn, who paired these singularly ugly shoes with a short white satin skirt and train. But let's give her some credit -- she is committed to those shoes, sporting them on several occasions. When asked by MTV where she got them, she said, "You just go to a good shoe repair! You just tell them to stack them and make them better!"
The nonprofit center, a consumer advocacy group, does not believe pink slime poses a safety concern. What officials there are looking at is whether "the stuff in pink slime is nutritionally less useful or less digestible," Klein said. She said the agency had plans to sample and test it.

Wayne County commissioners acted first among the three by voting last month to create an arts authority charged with asking voters to approve the property tax for the museum, which has been hammered by funding cuts. Each of the three counties was to set up its own arts authority.
The museum has a niche in a revival of downtown Fort Myers that began in earnest about five years ago. It needed it. Founded as an Army post in the 1850s, the town, like others in south Florida, experienced its share of booms and busts, depressions both economic and tropical, and like downtowns most everywhere suffered as retail fled to malls and hugged the main highways.
The Bulldogs took a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the second as Alex Stanford belted a one-out triple over the head of Hofmann as it trailed all the way to the wall. Stanford then scored on Alex Bonczyk's sacrifice fly.

Consider the call that Henry Skrimshander, the slick shortstop, gets from a scout on page 133. It's a cold call to Skrimshander's dorm room and the reason the scout is calling is to feel out Skrimshander's "signability" for the upcoming draft. The scout warns the shortstop that his agent can "really hurt your draftability." He then drops the possibility on Skrimshander that a club is thinking about drafting him in the first round. This is how Harbach concludes that first conversation between scout Dwight Rogner and the rising prospect:

Those ends are served in the 17 documents chosen by U.S. officials for the world to see—not to mention American voters. The Obama administration has refused to release a fuller record of its bin Laden collection, making it difficult to glean any larger truths about the state of the terrorist organization.
"(I) told him, 'Thank you.' I appreciate everything you guys have done for me," Rondo said before practice on Thursday. "Obviously, they won it for themselves. But they told me, 'We got this one for you.' That felt good. It felt like I was a part of it. It changed the series."

And that's when we realized some of these ready-made meals could easily be elevated with a little doctoring in the kitchen.

Q: What is the Fujita Scale?
Q: Making the movie sounds like a mini-boot camp.
As envisioned by playwright and North Shore native Marisa Wegrzyn, this is a home where fouled relationships and flying elbows fight for space with sharp-edged comedy — where Fitzgerald's addled but salt-of-the-earth matriarch looks at the bag of Starbucks coffee grounds that have replaced her downmarket decaf brand and disdainfully announces, "This isn't Seattle, this is America." Later, when a guest remarks that she wouldn't turn down a splash of juice, the retort is only half-joking: "What sort of splash would you turn down? A splash of acid?" Underneath the tired polite exterior, something nasty is about to blow, and director Shade Murray pulls no punches in his intimate staging for A Red Orchid Theatre, where the sound of thrashing heavy metal music is cut with the easy-listening lull of Barry Manilow's "I Can't Smile Without You." He's also styled Davis, both in wardrobe and hairstyle, so that she resembles a brunette version of the playwright. It's a bold and meta statement, considering this is the character whose dialogue most resembles the sardonic writing voice of Wegrzyn herself.
A public committee has been formed to force a recall of Mathieu’s election, the mayor said.

This 1964 epic blames Rome's decline on Commodus (Christopher Plummer), who seized power in 180 A.D. under questionable circumstances. He subverts his statesman father's peace talks with the barbarian hordes and runs the world's superpower into the ground. Audiences didn't hail Caesar, despite a chariot duel, a poisoned apple and other flourishes. The three-hour flop cost producer Samuel Bronston his toga and his huge Spanish film studio. Extras in a three-disc limited collector's edition range from featurettes to a souvenir program.

"Our cross country guys won the conference and went to state, so we should be strong in the distance events," Zerjal said. "Columbia has won the conference the last two years, so we'll probably compete for the title along with them and Wesclin.
