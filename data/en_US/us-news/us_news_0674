Assistant U.S. Attorney Ann Rowland circled back to much of FBI Special Agent Kirk Spielmaker's previous testimony from Thursday during her re-direct.

The amount does not include donated items, which easily are valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars. About 10 percent of the 13,000 cases in the campaign this year were adopted, which is standard. One hundred of the cases are profiled in the Post-Dispatch. Those who do adopt a case tend to buy items from a list provided by the needy families, such as clothing, household appliances and toys. The families not adopted receive a portion of the cash collected that comes into the general 100 Neediest Cases fund.

I called W.S. Bellows Construction, the company that engineered and built the obelisk and star, hoping that they'd have old construction photos, and that someone there would be able to explain to me exactly why the monument is considered such feat of engineering.

We've always suspected that such a correlation reflects differing initial attitudes toward marriage rather than a cohabitation effect--that people with more traditionalist outlooks are less likely both to cohabit and to divorce. Jay says the latest studies show that such selection bias explains part but not all of the phenomenon--"that at least some of the risks may lie in cohabitation itself."

"We are concerned that the providers that engage in health care fraud may consider civil penalties and criminal fines a cost of doing business," Morris said. "By excluding the individuals who are responsible for the fraud, either directly or because of their positions or responsibility in the company that engaged in fraud, we can influence corporate behavior without putting patient access to care at risk."

The chow: Big portions of chicken and beef teriyaki, chicken yakisoba and similar fare. The chicken yakisoba ($6) is a great deal and plenty for two people. Stir-fried noodles, chunks of boneless chicken and assorted veggies are heaped on the plate. Chicken Kat-su ($6) is a tasty option. Chicken is breaded, deep-fried and served with rice and a side of katsu sauce for dipping. The chicken comes out crunchy, yet tender. Spicy Pork Teriyaki ($6) is another tasty option for those not in the mood for chicken or beef. If you somehow didn't get enough to eat, you can order three pot stickers or two egg rolls for $1. The egg rolls are on the greasy side, but the pot stickers are a perfect combination of crunchy and chewy.

And perfectly disorienting, if a visitor is not careful. Besides being able to hear one's own heart, stomach and even inner ear, or the sounds emitted by a cellphone's display, first-timers in the quiet room find their other senses discombobulated by "cross-modal" perceptual effects.

These guys, led by Danny Woodburn (of "Seinfeld") and Martin Klebba (who stole "Project X") are the life of "Mirror Mirror," an otherwise spotty attempt at capturing the tone of "Enchanted." They have stilts that fold up like accordions that they wear for their robberies. They have names like "Napoleon" and "Grimm" and "Half-Pint" and "Chuckles." Alas, they don't sing.

Gemologist, despite a Barbaro-esque perfect five-for-five, gets shuffled back to third choice in the morning line. His Wood Memorial win was deceptively strong. He overcame severe traffic trouble in the first turn and then found another gear when challenged late in the stretch by a hard charging Alpha. It appeared that he was just getting lazy on the lead in the stretch but was never seriously challenged. Gemologist is a versatile runner and can concede the early pace. There is nothing not to like about Gemologist so his fans are likely drooling at the prospect of getting him at 6:1. He will likely be shorter odds by post time, but still a value for a horse this good.
Show jumper Mark Leone will be teaching Oct. 7, dressage trainer Chris von Martels the next day and eventer Doug Payne on Oct. 9.

Falsely representing themselves to be FBI agents, online criminals often send blast e-mails to thousands of prospective victims notifying them of impending windfalls, typically from lottery winnings or inheritance. The e-mails direct the victim to call someone else in another government agency and at that point, the victim is charged various fees to claim the windfall, which turns out to be non-existent.

"Most people are in love with the ideal of Ronald Reagan in broad terms," said Jon Fleischman, a former California Republican Party executive director who writes the conservative FlashReport blog. "Raising taxes is a legitimate part of his history. But as a practical matter, a great number of conservatives will first learn that Reagan signed tax increases when they read this story. It's just not a part of the narrative."

In 2014, the tax credit would increase to 8 percent, and by 2015, households would get 10 percent back as an income tax credit or check.

Havre de Grace keeper Abbie Blessing made four saves.
The decision to shut it down or keep creating is one that many members of an older musical generation face. Billy Joel announced in the early 1990s that he was through writing pop songs, and has stuck to that. But Bob Dylan has kept writing and releasing new music. Both surviving members of the Beatles, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, keep turning out new projects. The Beach Boys have an unlikely reunion with a new album as well.

Fortunately for the Browns, the Patriots did plenty to defeat themselves. On that same drive, a pass to Irving Fryar drifted far enough that he had to step out of bounds at the Browns' 2 on what would have been a 41-yard completion.

The term "corporate welfare" implies a benefit, the bank chairman said, maintaining that there is no such benefit because there is a fee required for the bank's services. There is a guarantee from the federal government, he said, but "there's a fee attached to get that guarantee, and that enables us to give loans that couldn't be made otherwise. People talk about 'crony capitalism'; that implies we go out and pick winners and losers.

Wine with bright acidity supports a great many foods, while sparking effervescence helps ready the palate for the next bite. A wine's palate-cleansing ability is a plus when a rich dish is on the table - a foregone conclusion during the holidays. Subsequent bites of a dish like pate are less likely to overwhelm when a zippy wine is part of the equation.
"The senator from New Jersey didn’t want to hear anything about the past at the Port Authority, even though the building blocks of the agency’s dysfunction and fiscal problems were years in the making," Drewniak said. "In fact, as we learned today, Senator Lautenberg himself perpetuated some of the very dysfunction that only now, under Governor Christie and (New York Gov. Andrew) Cuomo, is being reversed through reforms and intensive audits."
You won't find anonymous, unsubstantiated allegations published in this column. What you will find is an opinion based on facts. You may interpret the facts differently and come to a different conclusion. That's OK. But let's disagree in a respectful manner.
But the Nets (10-30) are one of the worst teams in the league and there have been too many meltdowns along the way for one to assume the Blazers' issues are a thing of the past. Ask any player on the roster and they will almost certainly tell you their biggest disappointment this season is that the Blazers have given away between six and eight wins, most because of awful fourth quarter performances.

Police say their salaries reflect New Jersey’s high cost of living, years of experience on the job and union contracts allowing officers to quickly rise to the top of the pay scale.

Saving the world is serious business for a superhero. But when Robert Downey Jr. starts a battle scene on the set of The Avengers, he doesn't exactly have on an Iron Man face.
When I started making porn, the industry was filled with people who were in it only to make money. From company owners to the film crews to the salesmen, there were few people who would openly admit that they personally enjoyed the stuff. In fact, few of them actually did enjoy it. So when I came along openly admitting I loved the stuff, and especially when I was able to express this love in my gonzo-style filmmaking, the world of porn started to change. Today, the new young pornographers I meet wear as a badge of honor their devotion to the art form of porn. The VCR and now the Internet have made career choices in my business plentiful and much more acceptable, at least to a growing group of courageous Americans. I am very proud to have been a part of this.
A drop in the unemployment rate wasn't necessarily a healthy sign for the job market. The rate fell from 8.2 percent in March to 8.1 percent in April. But that was mainly because more people gave up looking for work.
It was last June when Nichols first took his argument for rate hikes to nearly three dozen community meetings. The proposal, though, was put on hold when members of the City Council said they would not approve any increases until the city hired an independent representative to scrutinize hikes in water and electricity bills, a position created by a voter-approved City Charter Amendment.
Clevelanders' medical needs are many -- a list headed by the prevalence of obesity and chronic diseases like diabetes -- and the resources to control and manage them are too few.

But just as Scorsese is looking back through film history, he's also looking ahead: "Hugo" is his first 3-D film. For a medium that has undergone a lot of criticism and doubt since James Cameron's groundbreaking "Avatar," Scorsese's enthusiastic embrace of 3-D does a lot for its credibility.

Dunlap, like many of Sunday's performers, goes back a ways with Pacifica Performances. He worked with them when they were the "Pacifica Arts and Heritage Council" (formed in 1976), and their concert venue was the old Firehouse in Pedro Point. The nonprofit moved to the Community Center in the late '80s and to its current location in 1997. It offers live performances every weekend, covering a musical gambit which includes blues, fingerstyle guitar, classical, world, jazz, bluegrass, Americana, country and folk, in addition to spoken word. In 2001, the Pacifica Arts and Heritage Council officially became Pacifica Performances.
"Publicness is an emblem of epochal change," he writes. "It is profoundly disruptive. Publicness threatens institutions whose power is invested in the control of information and audiences.

The warehouse loft decor has been pleasantly buffed and shined, along the lines of those TV home makeover shows where skin-deep design miracles are performed while simultaneously contorting an equally slim budget. Now, Saffron has the kind of environment where Tuesday night drop-ins or Target Field ticketholders can feel comfortable while taking a crack at the younger Wadi's extraordinary riff on the BLT, embellished with a house-cured lamb belly and thick swipes of a saffron-scented tomato jam.

Just last week, the Department of Health refused to give The Associated Press copies of its responses to people who complain that drilling had affected their health. That lack of transparency -- justified in the name of protecting private medical information -- means the public has no way of knowing even how many complaints there are or how many are valid.

It is the first full week of March and spring is coming despite the recent snow, sleet and frost that hit my garden last week. I have slumbered happily in front of my fireplace with Jett, my black cat, and a number of good books to keep me company for the past three months and now I'm waking up to the realization that my garden will be on the Garden Conservancy Tour in just three short months.

Hitchcock said: "The first thing (Backes) has to do is trust his linemates a little more and secondly he's got to play more reckless. He played safe … and playing against Joe is no day at the beach. Joe was dialed in and Joe was playing for his life. He was a terrific player in our series, so David had his hands full. The other thing is, sometimes 5 on 5 with as much as David plays on the power play and he kills penalties, sometimes 5 on 5 is a rest and we want to get him past that, where he's really contributing more 5 on 5 ... because he's back playing a little more reckless and not so careful. He plays reckless on the power play, which is great, it helps us. He's obviously a great penalty killer. We just want him to trust his linemates and not have to be the safety net that he thinks he has to be all the time."

I hung out to watch some great surfing – the Australian Tom Carroll snapped a turn on a barrel at Pipeline that is still legendary today – I have to admit I saw it, but it didn't register as a great moment at the time. I do remember the guys all wore helmets and tighter trunks – looking a little like Tour de France riders out in the waves. A network television crew filmed the whole thing, and the Hard Rock Café was one of the sponsors – I wore out that T-shirt with "PRESS" on the sleeve.

Throughout the show, she was again accompanied by one of the best dance troupes I've ever seen on an arena pop concert stage. All eight dancers are fantastic so it feels a little foolish to single anybody out, but what the heck: special commendation goes to Sloan-Taylor Rabinor, who is in masterful command of her body, and who makes every twitch of her arms and turn of her head reverberate like a signal drum. Rabinor was particularly stunning during the encore version of "Born This Way;" in a further sign of where Lady Gaga is heading, the dancers are dressed in simple yellow tunics. Their high heels left offstage, they hit the floorboards barefoot.
In my opinion, the proper response to bridge suicides is to ignore them. They are not newsworthy. We should focus instead on doing everything we can to increase quality of life and celebrate its beauty. A morbid preoccupation with death, and frantic efforts to control it, is not charitable; it is merely symptomatic of an anxious, fear-ridden, death-phobic society that confuses intrusiveness with compassion.

Scherzer's lack of command -- he threw 119 pitches in 4 2/3 innings -- stood in particular contrast to the easy strikes rookie Drew Smyly threw all day Saturday. Smyly, a left-hander, doesn't have the stuff Scherzer does, most notably a late-moving, 97-m.p.h. heater, but he has a liquid delivery that requires little in the way of muscle memory. Scherzer, by contrast, winds up and delivers in a violent fashion, which is more difficult to duplicate -- think of a golf swing with too many moving parts.

Today, doctors and therapists focus on a handful of treatments that have been validated by clinical studies. For teens with anorexia, the first-line treatment is something called family-based therapy, in which parents and siblings work with the patient at home to help restore normal eating habits, said Dr. James Lock, an adolescent psychiatrist at Stanford University who specializes in treating eating disorders. Treating patients at home instead of in a hospital setting is less disruptive to their lives and is thought to promote recovery.

Precipitation and thunderstorms in the West will wind down on Friday as the disturbances of the region push into the Plains. The southern storm of the West will bring an end to the intense heat in the Southern Plains, while frontal boundaries exiting the Rockies move into the Plains as a strengthening warm front. This disturbance will bring moderate rain and thunderstorms to areas from the Upper Midwest through the southern Ohio and Tennessee Valley. There is a slight risk of severe storms with a few possible tornadoes in areas across central and eastern Kansas, far northern and northeastern Oklahoma, into western and central Missouri. In the East, low pressure will lift across New England with rain showers and chances of thunderstorms as it progresses into southeastern Canada. Winds circulating around this system will spread a cooler airmass across the region, setting the stage for possible snow development across the area. To the south of this system, an associated cold front will trail through the Mid-Atlantic and cross the northern tier of the Southeast with chances of isolated showers and thunderstorms. Temperatures in the Lower 48 states Thursday have ranged from a morning low of 15 degrees at Mt. Washington, N.H. to a high of 102 degrees at Junction, Texas

Like in midfield, Klinsmann has considerable tactical flexibility up front. He has fielded lineups with one target striker supported by a mobile five-man midfield or a pair of additional, more withdrawn forwards attacking from wider positions. He also has experimented with a more traditional 4-4-2 alignment, which was effective in November's 3-2 win at Slovenia.

According to the trustees, the 2011 state grand jury report on Sandusky showed that a graduate assistant coach - later identified as Mike McQueary - went to Paterno on March 2, 2002, and told the head coach that he had seen Sandusky "in the Lasch Building showers fondling or doing something of a sexual nature to a young boy." Sandusky had left the university coaching ranks in 1999 but would bring children to the school on field trips. The youths were part of a charity he's founded.
The economy added 80,000 jobs in October, and the unemployment rate dipped to 9 percent. It was the 13th straight month of hiring gains. Still, the additional jobs were fewer than the roughly 125,000 that are needed each month just to keep up with population growth.

The Ahwahnee Hotel: The wonderfully historic Ahwahnee Hotel is an architectural landmark (designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood, opened in 1927) and an amazing place that you should visit at least once. The hotel includes a giant fireplace in the lobby and sweeping waterfall views visible through the super-sized floor-to-ceiling windows in the cavernous main dining room. Guest rooms range from modest to opulent. There are Native American design accents throughout hotel, which has 99 rooms, parlors, suites and 24 cottages.

I was under the impression that all media people who came within 100 yeards had sworn an oath to totally kiss our butts, trip all over themselves to find meaning in any gibberish we spout, and downplay as 'fringy' anything that might reflect badly on us or give comfort to the 1-percenters.

Perhaps a better, more equitable solution would be for all of us to acquire a thicker skin and more education. That includes Sony. With criticism running rampant online, there's no quarter of gaming immune to attack, warranted or otherwise. Leading the assault are those who see gaming merely as a waste of time, as a brainwashing tool, or as a catalyst for anti-social behavior. Almost always, the ones out in front of this charge haven't played the game at the center of their wrath, probably haven't even picked up a controller.

I would like to respond to a letter in last weeks paper titled: " Inaccuracies." Considering that the writer was alluding to be more knowledgeable than others, the information was inaccurate. The correct information is easy to find. In 1996 Caltrans reluctantly released a report that showed that the Devil's Slide Bypass was equal in cost to the Tunnels, and due to necessary seismic upgrades could cost more than the Tunnels. Based on that fact and other facts, the public overwhelmingly voted for the Tunnels by 74 percent. While the project has taken longer and cost more than anyone envisioned, it would have been worse with the Bypass. Caltrans website lists the cost of the project at $439 million for the Tunnels (not $2 billion), and $42 million for the new bridges. I look forward to the "People's Tunnels" opening later this year.

Mr. Valor first read about NP001 in a news release. He tracked down published papers that led him to believe the compound was sodium chlorite, a chemical that in various forms is used in municipal water treatment plants.

The chemical is easy to order online and is inexpensive. He estimates he has spent less than $150 total.

As his fans and critics (both plentiful) know, Arellano's signature dish as a journalist is a generous dollop of pop-culture erudition and political analysis, leavened with meticulous reporting and spiced with politically incorrect humor. A longtime food writer (and now blogger), he made his national reputation with ¡Ask a Mexican!, in which he supplies carefully researched, mildly ironic ripostes to both Mexican and non-Mexican readers' frequently clueless queries.

Over the past decade, a new fad has taken hold among academics and liberal journalists: call it the new science of conservative phrenology. No, it doesn't actually involve using calipers to determine intelligence based on the size and shape of people's heads. The measuring devices are better -- MRIs and gene sequencers -- but the conclusions are worse. The gist is this: Conservatives and liberals don't just have different world views or ideas, they have different brains; the right and left are just hard-wired to think differently.

What happened in 1995 is AGL created a parent company, AGL Resources, much like here, you have Laclede Group, and you have Laclede Gas.

This affection for natural landscapes is an extension of her hippie past. In the early '70s, von Gal was a young mother in Tivoli, New York. "I made my own tofu and sewed my daughter's clothes and everything. Then I decided it was time to get out in the world." She moved to Manhattan to work on design projects for Peter Sharp, who owned the Carlyle Hotel, and ultimately, with the boom in interest in English garden design, established her own business. "I always had this environmental side to me but couldn't exercise it—being a tree hugger wasn't very posh," she says. Her latest project links her passion for landscape restoration and the principles of sustainability she learned in the '70s. It has allowed, she says, "my life and my work to become completely intertwined."

I strolled into Beckys Bistro thinking all I would find is a beer, a shot and year-old beer nuts. I not only found great jazz by Freddie Sivillo and the RCA duo, but was introduced to Arnold Palmer. The drink, not the golfer. The half-lemonade/half iced tea is apparently named after Palmer because its his favorite. Sip it as a virgin, or light it up with vodka. I chose the latter.

Her central point is that this most famous story about The End is a window on the beginnings of Christianity. Those origins were far more dynamic, circumstantial and political than most people realize, and the Book of Revelation played a peculiar role.
There are two main problems with an abrupt shift of these costs to the locals, and Mr. O'Malley seeks to address both. The first is that transferring costs from one level of government to another doesn't inherently solve anything — after all, the taxpayers are ultimately on the hook either way — and the second is that some local governments, Baltimore City's in particular, are more strapped than others.

In his forthcoming book, "The Harm in Hate Speech," New York University political philosopher Jeremy Waldron calls racist rhetoric a "slow-acting poison, accumulating here and there, word by word, so that eventually it becomes harder and less natural for even the good-hearted members of the society" to engage all the members of the community. He argues that hate speech is calculated to undermine the "good standing" that everyone in a diverse democracy must have for it to function smoothly.

Plants are also positioned according to their needs for sunlight, said Vince Kirchner, a master gardener and permaculture specialist from Tiffin, Ohio, who has built a few herb spirals while working to start a business in permaculture design. Plants that need full sun go at the top or on the south side of the spiral.

"You can't build a team thinking about someone else's bullpen. Your job is to score as many runs as possible against the starters."
Lowdown: Huff saw action last year, catching 19 passes for 303 yards and three touchdowns, but this season he will be asked to replace Jeff Maehl as the team's primary deep threat. Huff might be a tad more explosive but must also display the savvy and hands that made Maehl special (24 career touchdown receptions). Senior Lavasier Tuinei returns and the team is excited about the potential of junior Justin Hoffman, a projected starter. But neither can match the breakaway speed of Huff, a four-star recruit in 2010. Playmakers on the perimeter make the spread-option extremely difficult to defend. That go-to, big-play guy through the years has been Demetrius Williams, Jaison Williams, Maehl, and now, maybe, Huff, who also doubles as a kick returner.

He has a great sense of humor, but this has never been used for commercial purposes and may not sit well with tennis officinados anyway.”
And like chronic pain, chronic itch appears to go hand in hand with depression. The relationship between depression and the two chronic conditions is undoubtedly complex: People who are depressed seem to tolerate pain and itching less well than those who are not; but the nagging distraction of chronic pain or chronic itch also seems to trigger depression in many.

Live musical performances are suggested by the venue's name, but that is misleading; they are mainly an afterthought here. Whereas the new outdoor stage is at the center of the Power Plant complex — something everyone, those eating pizza on the first level, on the balconies, strolling in the Inner Harbor, can listen to — at Xfinity, the outdoor stage is a side attraction.

It's also highly uninviting, with just one understaffed bar and beer kiosk and surrounded by the parking lots of Xfinity and its neighboring sports complexes.

Nixon, meanwhile, worked at Lucy's, the one-time occupant of the space. She favors a bold approach, evident from the chandelier in the entry made of wine bottles, Mardi Gras beads and kitchen tools; and riveting dishes like Noah's bun ($14). It's a brightly colored, even more brightly flavored, mound of rice vermicelli layered with a confetti of lettuce, cabbage, fresh herbs, pickled vegetables, fried shallots, roasted peanuts, crispy fried shrimp and petite meatballs. Little minefields of jalapeno dot the landscape, with more fire from ground pickled bird chile and a splash of nuoc cham.

"There is a good chance that the main way a lot of leaders of the church will respond to the election of a Mormon to the presidency will be to stay as quiet and uninvolved in politics as possible and put as much daylight as possible between that president and the institutional church," said Russell Arben Fox, a political scientist at Friends University in Wichita, Kan., and a Mormon writer. "They're a global church and have responsibilities all around the world. For them to appear to be lining up behind a Mormon president and endorsing his policies would just be bad for the church."

When San Franciscans got a look at the first mile-and-a-half of the Embarcadero Freeway, "an unadorned gray concrete barricade" blocking the magnificent waterfront view, the outcry stopped further construction. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1959 opposed seven more freeways and turned down $280 million in federal aid. (The hated mile-and-a-half was finally torn down in 1991, after the 1989 earthquake closed it and the city's commuters adapted with remarkably little trouble.) Baltimore residents whose neighborhoods were slated for demolition united across racial lines and fought Interstate 70 for more than 20 years; they eventually halted the road at the city limits, though the African American community of Rosemont never entirely recovered.

The law, which ignited a national firestorm over immigration and led to a meeting last week between Gov. Jan Brewer and President Barack Obama, makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally.

Schumaker, when he said, "We're back," could also have meant righthander Adam Wainwright, who fired four strong innings at Miami on the stadium court Sunday, holding the Marlins to one unearned run and one hit in a 4-2 Cardinals victory secured by David Freese's three-run homer - his third of the spring - in the eighth. Wainwright has permitted just two hits and one unearned run over his first nine innings this spring after missing all last season following Tommy John elbow surgery.

Foamy white horses crest over liquid blue hills, then gallop onto a carpet of golden sand. White seagulls soar across the cerulean sky like living kites.

Should the United States someday suffer a budget crisis, it will be hard not to conclude that Obama and his allies sowed the seeds, because they ignored conspicuous warnings. A further irony will not escape historians. For two years, Obama and members of Congress have angrily blamed the shortsightedness and selfishness of bankers and rating agencies for causing the recent financial crisis. The president and his supporters, the historians will note, were equally shortsighted and self-centered -- though their quest was for political glory, not financial gain.

In general, I work "conservatively"  that is, I test my assumptions against all the reasons my thinking might be wrong. I look at all the innocent explanations I can imagine for what I see in the data. Only after I've ruled those out do I draw conclusions that improper or fraudulent actions might have occurred. I've never seen a story that was not strengthened by getting the views of those implicated in the wrongdoing. For that reason, and for accuracy and basic fairness, I go to the people implicated in the data  if needed, multiple times  to ask, encourage and urge them to give their perspectives. But unfortunately, they often decline to comment.
