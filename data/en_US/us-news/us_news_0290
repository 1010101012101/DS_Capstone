Early on, Lewis looked as though she was going to run away with the title. She birdied the first from off the green, then converted a six-foot birdie effort on the par-three second to move to 16-under, where she was five clear of the field.
The best time to plant deciduous trees, including those that produce fall color, is in December and January when the trees are dormant, Eisenhower said. The soil acts as an insulator, protecting the roots from frost, he added. A deciduous tree loses its leaves in a certain season or after a period of growth.

"This is a positive development. It will lead to job creation, sharpening our competitiveness, enhancing state revenues and enhancing our energy security," said NJPC spokesman Jim Benton. "The reality is, this exploration is just as likely to uncover natural gas as it is oil ... and drilling already is done in the Atlantic, off shore in Canada, which sells it back to us."
Because JGR still owed him for the final year on his contract, Ford was in no rush to climb back atop a pit box. And if he had to spend the entire season sitting at home, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

It appears you purchased your policy to cover your airline ticket, through your airline's site. I'm a little dubious of the insurance offered through airlines because they can be extremely restrictive. (I've heard insurance insiders joke that you have to die in a plane crash or lose a limb to make a successful claim, but I'm sure that's an exaggeration.)

"At the end of one party, a musician left his fiddle with the instructions to my housemates, 'If you can find somebody to buy this for $100, you'll be doing me a favor.' I bought it. I'm stubborn enough and I was intrigued enough to learn to play it. It seemed like a magic trick to me -- these people are taking a bow and a fiddle and getting such a soulful kind of music out of it. As bad as I was when I started, I kept at it. And I got better.
Poly Prep (7-3) gave Zapata plenty of support, scoring five runs off Edwin Corniel, one of George Washington's aces. Christian Pellegrino blasted a two-run, opposite-field homer in the fifth, Calabrese had three hits and an RBI and Phil Maldari also drove in a run. It was another productive performance form the lineup, which has scored 48 runs in the four wins this week.

During a recent shoot at the closed Maryland House of Correction in Jessup, the Whites fit comfortably into their roles, both as creators and partners. Trevor, though young for a director (especially one working with such a big-name cast), seemed to know what he wanted from his actors, and he didn't shrink from asking them to try a scene again, this time a little differently. Tim was usually at his side, or maybe just a few feet away, offering advice when asked and a reassuring tap on the back when a little support was called for.

“The thing with The Boss, he’s an old football coach,” said Derek Jeter, the player who helped deliver five of his seven titles. “So his way, he sort of looked at the baseball season like we played 12 games and we had to win every single day. But he really expected to win every night, every day.”

This is a wedge Cuomo can use -- indeed, has begun to use -- to further destabilize the speaker. And his respectful wooing of legislators -- like-minded and otherwise -- is a variation of the same tactic.
Many of us do not make the connection between emotions and our eating habits. Changes in appetite can sometimes indicate that a child or adolescent is undergoing stress. Some with depression and/or anxiety might eat more for comfort. Others will be less interested in eating from lack of appetite. Both ends of this continuum may warrant a further look into what is happening in your child's life.
But Felton's strong finish wouldn't have been possible if not for strong nights from Matthews and Crawford. During the first two games, the duo had made just 15 of 49 shots. But they combined to make more field goals (16) on fewer attempts (32) in one game against the Nuggets (2-1).
For the Knicks to get even a game off the Heat, they'll need Anthony to be the same player he was down the stretch of the regular season. But here's the problem: He's going to see a steady diet of LeBron James, maybe the best perimeter defender in the game, and Shane Battier between himself and the ball. The Heat's length, quickness and speed aren't going to go away.

The loss was a painful one for the Blazers, but they are in no position to let it get to them, or to have a prolonged hangover from it. And they certainly should not get caught up in trying to keep from falling to the seventh spot in the Western Conference to avoid the Lakers in the first round of the playoffs.
Apparently, it's not enough anymore just to yell "Tequila!" Connoisseurs will want to pair it with the appropriate food and branch out beyond the basic margarita.

* The highlight of practice was a 75-yard touchdown pass from Braxton Miller to running back Carlos Hyde. Miller scrambled to the right, and with the Buckeyes teaching their passcatchers to break off their deep routes short and run their short routes long in scramble situations, Hyde took off, caught the ball behind the defense, and took off.
He also has dealt with pain in his right wrist and elbow, and is in danger of losing his card if he fails to finish among the top 125 money winners.

The committee’s vision for the ballroom, a minimalist, contemporary look, was accomplished, thanks to White Lilac Events. The ballroom, covered in dove gray carpet, featured either mirrored rectangular tables or round tables covered in dove gray silk linens with Lucite chairs. Dramatic floral centerpieces showcased three-foot high bunches of bound white calla lilies, balls of white carnations scattered on the table and tall glass cylinders filled with water and topped with floating candles. The walls, draped floor-to-ceiling in white chiffon, featured Felsen’s black and white photography on over-sized plaza screens of a heady mix of artists working at Gemini since the early ‘70s.

And if the program is preserved for the most impaired clients while eliminating or sharply curtailed for others, the increase in costs associated with nursing home care could be minimized.

The Edwardsville standout did just that with her team tied with Incarnate Word late in the first game of a match Wednesday at Incarnate Word. The Red Knights were expecting a fireball from Epenesa when she soared high into the air, but the Purdue University recruit showed her softer side with a roll shot that surprised IWA and gave the Tigers a big point en route to a 25-22 victory in the first game.

And remarks offered by Sen. Elaine Kontominas Alquist, D-San Jose, raised some eyebrows when she uttered the infamous "n-word" on the floor of the chamber in relating her own family's brush with racism. Alquist, whose father was a Greek immigrant, wore a black sweatshirt and told how her India-born daughter-in-law was on the receiving end of the epithet as a child. In context, Alquist's repetition of the word hardly aimed to offend.

BART's beginnings represent a major milestone in the decades-long dream of many to see a rapid rail line go completely around the bay. That might have been the vision 50 years ago but boards of supervisors in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties decided to skip the photo opportunity and were quick to dump the idea in the trash. These far-sighted gents thought the trains would haul folks from here up to shop in San Francisco's stores instead of buying locally.

Well, sure. Beltran was taking questions about a supposed slump before Wednesday's game. Funny how 7 RBI in one game changes perceptions. He entered the game with 4 RBI in his last 11 games, all hitting cleanup. What has been most surprising is the club's willingness to play him every day. His .535 slugging percentage is largely based on 7 home runs and 1 double, a curious power split. His .933 OPS entering Thursday's game is very close to last season's .910. After much hyperventilation about Beltran appearing in CF, he has yet to play there, just as last year. He has played as advertised.

The menu successfully works on two levels. It's easy to sit down to a three-course meal, but the format is casual enough for the nibblers among us. The small plates are perfect for those who want to stop by on their way somewhere else. The nine dishes in this category are interesting, portions are generous and they represent a great value. Aside from the fried green beans ($6), served with a fresh fig dip, eggplant puree or mayonnaise-based sauce, depending on the night, Keller created Cocomole tacos ($4), five fried tortilla triangles topped with a dab of the famed beef cheeks mixed with a chile and chocolate sauce and crowned with a creamy dab of guacamole and a single leaf of cilantro.

Because Cabernet commends itself to a few years of age, the only thing better than one bottle is two - or here, two bottles worth of wine in a single glass receptacle. Magnums age more slowly than regular bottles (less surface contact with the cork) and make for an instant party. The 2003 Ridge Santa Cruz Mountains Monte Bello ($220, K&L, San Francisco and Redwood City; $235, Beltramo's, Menlo Park) certainly fits the bill. Paul Draper (The Chronicle's 2006 Winemaker of the Year) consistently makes one of the finest American Cabernets from his rugged Santa Cruz Mountains vineyards, massively structured but lean and extraordinarily complex. The 2003 is one vintage past current, but Monte Bello needs years to blossom and can last for decades, making for a gift that won't be forgotten come January.

Umenyiora was replaced at right end by Pierre-Paul, who has 15½ sacks and has become the defense’s cornerstone. Even though Umenyiora said he hasn’t played left end since 2004, no one expects the embarrassment of riches to be a problem. If anything, Tuck and Pierre-Paul can move inside to allow all three on the field at the same time.

Around the globe, the usual troubles -- endless bloodshed between Palestinians and Israelis, fighting between U.S. soldiers and insurgents in Afghanistan, the meltdown of anarchic African countries such as Somalia and Congo -- mostly got worse. Simmering tensions between Russia and Georgia blew up into a short-lived invasion. Zimbabwe, once a breadbasket, is now in danger of becoming a failed state. The economic downturn is hurting the rest of the world as badly as, if not worse than, the United States.
Needless to say, when the hard rain woke me Saturday at 2, I struggled to get back to sleep. I did, but I was awoken again at 3 by the rain, at 4 by the rain - and at 4:15 by a need to use the restroom. (You can wake to dripping water only so many times before something has to give.)

It doesn't work that way for all governors, of course. For governors of Texas, executions seem to be the high points of their terms.
That might have been one of the top three proudest moments I've ever had as a director. Because you look at Matt, he's totally an energetic guy, but you look at his body of work and it's like, long. So for him to say he went to a new place is great. But he's so good at it, he makes it look like it's the easiest tennis swing. It's that thing. It's the hardest thing.
The first new jobs could arrive early next year when the company adds a third shift to its 900-worker Cleveland Engine Plant No. 1 in Brook Park. At about the same time, it plans to close its 350-worker Engine Plant No. 2 on that site.

--RHP Jeff Samardzija ran his record to 2-0. Friday's victory was something quite different than Samardzija's season debut Sunday, when he came within one out of a complete-game victory over Washington. In that game, Samardzija threw 110 pitches over 8 2/3 innings. On Friday, he lasted only five innings as he ran his pitch count to 103. The Cardinals batted around in the fifth and Samardzija appeared to be one batter away from not qualifying for the win. "That's obviously not the start you want to have, five and dive," Samardzija said. "But you can do that when your offense goes out and puts up nine."

"This group is either trying to acquire or lease the property to run some charitable events on weekends. That’s all I know at this point," Hunt said.

The School Board unanimously approved the raises on Monday night. The increases follow three years of smaller raises or frozen salaries, district leaders say, and come just after voters approved a tax increase.
We started with cocktails: the Copperhead ($9), a blood orange juice and rye drink that's nicely balanced and citrusy, and the Bee's Knees ($10), a sweet, easy-to-drink combination of gin, honey liqueur, lemon juice and local honey.

But no one anticipated this kind of a free fall - one that has the Big Red at 3-8 and in the midst of a six-game losing streak entering Sunday's contest against the visiting Rams. As each loss piles up and with each errant pass by Derek Anderson, Warner probably picks up more Hall of Fame support.

In response to the recent letter from William Smith ("Gas tax brings out whiners," Oct. 19), let me first state that I am one of those "freeloading" conservatives Mr. Smith complains about in his letter. My employer pays me twice a month, and each and every time I look at my pay stub, I have deductions for state and federal withholding so I must be a taxpaying "freeloader." I trust I have your permission to use my car to drive on our roads, use police and fire services if I need them, and put my trash out on pick-up day.

If a game is not going to expound on the "After Burner" model much — and "Hard Lock" does not — it needs to make up for it with story and atmosphere.

At least 100 activists from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area plan to ride buses to Chicago, organizers said. Dozens of environmentalists from Madison, Wis., plan to bicycle to Chicago to protest wars they say are fought for oil.

And smaller fringe groups often show up at international protests, occasionally destroying property and clashing with police.
Then again, the Nuggets played with an energy that would've been hard to match as they sent the series back to Staples Center for an all-or-nothing showdown on Saturday night.

What this Stanford law professor finds should make everyone blanch. Nearly seven out of ten black women are unmarried and fewer than half of all black men are husbands. Black marriage has declined because black men have higher incarceration rates and lower work rates, he says. However, black male professionals with big paychecks don't rush to the altar with black women either. Some don't want to marry because of a glut of eligible female partners while others choose women outside of their race.

Mostly MOCA tells a mythic tale in which graffiti, an Expressionist art form, is largely born in Manhattan, spreads across the country and finally envelopes the world. If the story sounds familiar, that's because it replays New York School legend, long since discredited, about Abstract Expressionist painting in the 1940s. The generative action has merely shifted from 10th Street and Greenwich Village, stamping ground of Pollock and De Kooning, to the South Bronx and the Lower East Side, hangouts of Crash and Kenny Scharf.

I have been dating a widow for about three months. She was married for 10 years before and has three girls, ages 9, 7 and 4. I met and get along with the two younger ones, but the older one is quite challenging. She wasn’t easy before her father died suddenly during a basketball game, and now it’s clear she’s fearful of her mother leaving her, too. I am not sure how to approach this and want to help. How can I?

Little Bird was the most eagerly awaited opening of the past year, even before Gabriel Rucker won the 2011 James Beard Rising Star Chef Award. Compared with Rucker's headquarters, Le Pigeon, Little Bird is downtown and larger, and the bubbling bistro has been jammed since its opening at the end of 2010. Rucker takes all the standard bistro dishes -- escargot, coq au vin, plus cheese plates and even roasted marrow bones -- and puts his own spin on them, as well as hosting a rousing bar scene based on muscular house cocktails and French and Oregon wines. And the admirable Le Pigeon burger -- limited to five a night at its originating restaurant -- is always available in any number here.

And Hardaway looks like a different player than he did two months ago -- literally, he looks different. Hardaway thinks back at his performance at Michigan State, and he is appalled -- not by his 1-for-10 shooting performance, but by how he handled it. At halftime, he was violently anti-smile.

(Pastry bags are available at most kitchen and baking stores.) Begin with plain meringue, making sure it sticks to only one side of the bag. Then add cocoa-flavored meringue to the other side of the bag, making sure the cocoa and plain meringues do not mix.

But in a corner of the room, in an area near the showers that is partially removed from the daily clamor of professional football, you can typically find cornerback Cary Williams sitting by himself, tapping away on his white iPhone.

Most of all, the recent indictment of County Executive John Leopold on charges that he misused county employees for his personal and political benefit makes strong leadership from the council more important than ever.

These very questions and debates have become the most challenging part of parenthood for me. I’ve discovered just how controversial so many of these topics are, and I wasn’t prepared for how strongly people - particularly other parents - feel about many of these issues. I’ve learned that I have to watch what I say when discussing hot topics like vaccinations and breastfeeding.

--LF Brett Gardner, who was placed on the disabled list after straining his right elbow while making a diving catch Tuesday, said he made the injury a little worse when he attempted to take batting practice the next day. "I'm on the 15-day DL, so there's no point in me trying to hit in two or three days. I'd like to be hitting in eight to 10 days in a perfect scenario," Gardner said Thursday.

We got a glimpse of just how interesting back in 2009 when The New York Times reported that more and more Mexican parents were sending money north to help support their children in the United States. Just like their parents and grandparents before them, this generation had trekked across mountains and deserts for the promise of better-paying jobs in the United States that would allow them to send money to their families. But now, they were unemployed and hit hard by the recession, and they were the ones who needed help.

And the touch-screen interface on the Vita is cumbersome and annoying. As a smartphone and tablet user, I'm used to a game or app launching when I tap on its icon. But on the Vita, users are forced to go through an intermediate screen after they tap on an app icon. The screen allows users to download new content, update the app or, yes, actually launch it. In other words, it takes two taps to actually start a game, which is one tap too many.

But Taco María's ever-changing specials are its signature. The truck's quesadilla de tuétano triggers Pavlovian devotion.

I tried other websites, starting with AARP. The site directs consumers to an AARP-branded Aetna plan. I entered my ZIP code and got the same response: the plan was "not available in your area." Next, at a top-rated insurance broker site, my ZIP code brought up one result. The $561-a-month GHI policy covered annual physical and gynecologic exams, prescription drugs with a co-pay, hospitalization and outpatient surgery. But it did not cover, among other things, any other office visits; inpatient physical therapy; ER professional charges; diagnostic admissions; and diagnostic lab tests. To me, that seems like too much money to spend for what amounts to catastrophic coverage.

What's not so good?: Nevada City is a walkable town, and crashing your old Buick around in the woods in which "Have One On Me" is set is not encouraged by the rangers. Newsom jets from city to city with her harp. If she hasn't driven a car since her license test, it wouldn't exactly surprise me. Listening to this set while you're is a hopeless task: crank it up as loud as it'll go, and you still won't be able to make out what she's saying. Alarmingly, that's also true if you're playing the album in the solitude of your teepee. Even with cans on, there are many stretches of HOOM -- particularly HOOM3, where the stories climax -- where Newsom's words are incomprehensible at any volume. I can't even begin to understand why this might be: often, she's accompanied by nothing but her harp. It might be a mixing slip-up, or a consequence of her surgically-altered voice, or blowback from all the vibrato; in any case, it's a major problem. An album with words this carefully assembled, right down to the syntactic structures of the clauses, ought to play clearly. Instead, a flood of unpunctuated (and tremulous) vowels sogs up the mixes; Newsom's black humor, which has never been sharper than it is here, is completely swamped. "Go Long" is both vicious and hilarious -- it's the song where she gets some digs in at the big spider in her bed -- but it might take you several plays before you realize that. You might never realize it. Hence, I urge you with all the urging I have to urge to listen to "Have One On Me" with the lyric booklet in front of you. Better still, take it out of the case and treat it like a storybook; trust me, Newsom's writing holds up to that kind of examination. If she weren't a classical harpist, she could shut down your local poetry slam for good. So take your little black booklet out of the case, stop ogling the pictures, read it from top to bottom; you'll be rewarded. Oh, what's that you say? You won't go to the record store and plunk $20 for your own copy of "Have One On Me"? Your, um, "friend" with a Limewire account "e-mailed" you some MP3s for your iPod, and you're satisfied? In that case, pal, I don't even consider you an owner of this album. Joanna Newsom knocked herself out making a set meant to stand alongside your '70s favorites, so act if it's the Nixon Administration and Nick Drake has just cranked out a new one. C'mon, you spend nine bucks to see whatever lousy blockbuster Hollywood is slinging at you. You drop fifteen on a weak cocktail. You spend eight dollars to get out of the state.

I eschew granola in all its forms, typically leaving anything marked "natural" on the grocery-store shelf, and for all four of my babies' deliveries I received an epidural as early as I could convince the anesthesiologist on call to hand it over. Particularly as a mom of four school-aged kids, I'd fight like heck to live if I got sick. But later on, I'm not so sure.
