Moyer was born in 1962, the same year as classic sports oldie William "Refrigerator" Perry and Hollywood cougar Demi Moore. So we understand the fascination. But should Moyer be the biggest baseball news to come out of Colorado this season, the team is in a heap of trouble.

Here's what I like already. There seem to be just as many "buts" in the CVC's current offers as "yesses." In the original deal, the city, county and state negotiators just said "yes" to everything that Rams president John Shaw asked for. St. Louis negotiated from a stance of desperation the first time, which is how Shaw was able to stick in so many incredible clauses in this lease in the first place. As one person close to those original negotiations told me a few years ago, "We kept waiting for someone to say, 'OK, we'll agree to that, BUT you have to give us this … ' And the 'but' never came."

The Internal Revenue Service says that employers may consider their workers to be independent contractors if the workers largely set their own hours; follow their own direction; choose their own methods for performing their tasks; decide on their own whether to hire others to perform the work or assist with it; decide where to purchase supplies and services; and are responsible only for delivering a final product — but are free to do it their own way. If the workers earn more than $400 a year, they must pay the Social Security and Medicare taxes.
The study showed that craft brewers directly employ 4,170 workers and generate an additional 1,630 indirect jobs, with a total payroll of $179 million.
But the rich-poor divide is not huge. The preterm rate averages 12 percent in poor countries and 9 percent in wealthier ones. In fact, countries with the lowest rates of preterm births are not the wealthiest. After Belarus, the next-lowest rate is in Ecuador (5.1), followed by Latvia (5.3); Finland, Croatia, and Samoa (5.5); and Japan and Sweden at 5.9.

Reaching a pet custody agreement without a lot of help from attorneys and judges will save money, Raso said. Divorces can cost $1,000 and be resolved quickly or cost millions and take years.
The U.S. is in a hybrid state, with science and much of industry and government working in metric units while most consumers and consumer goods aren't. This tension is reflected in the nutrition label's use of grams, says Burkey Belser, president of Greenfield/Belser Ltd., the Washington, D.C., graphic-design company that designed the current nutritional label with the FDA.
"We are not limited to only reds," said Dieckmann, "but we have found Shiraz as a wine we like together."

It looks more and more like the tide has shifted, and Sacramento will keep the Kings after all.
Grace Prosniewski's April 27 column "'Generation Why?' searches for hope in job market," brought up some valid issues for young people that need to be addressed. My daughter's student loans are five times my credit card debt and, one year after graduating, she still hasn't landed a job in her chosen field. She has an internship, but works as a waitress.
Illinois started the season 6-0 but lost its final six games, becoming only the second bowl subdivision team in history to complete that reversal. However, the program is playing in consecutive bowl games for the first time since 1991 and '92, and can become the first in school history to win consecutive bowls.

Thus, the film serves up its share of red meat for every political stripe: Liberals can rally around Morris' pro-choice, pro-environment speechifying, while conservatives can relish seeing Democrats portrayed as "dirty tricksters." For independent voters, it's all fair game.
A: Yeah, there's a slight difference with some things that were going on that (allowed me to) feel better right after the surgery. It's a situation where he was able to go in there and kind of debris both of the knees, clean up a little bit of the problems that I was feeling in the right knee. So we're optimistic that that worked. I feel good. The tell-tale (sign) will be when I start playing again and Day 2, Day 3 of just making sure the swelling is not getting to the point where it's coming back so quickly.
The limestone-lined basement will house a small kitchen equipped with a wood-burning oven ("All of the food that we serve in the basement will come out of that oven," Becker said.) for a 50-seat casual, neighborhood cafe-style bar and dining room.
Starting the first day of school, and every Tuesday into October, students will be offered unlimited servings of Oregon-grown watermelon. That means many cafeteria workers will have to slice six or seven watermelons along with their other morning prep work -- daunting for sure. Again, a chef's demonstration of how it can be done safely and efficiently -- and produce a panful of mouth-watering slices pretty enough for a magazine cover -- calmed most worries.

Kucinich also criticized Kaptur for backing more than $547 billion in funding for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq at a time when poverty increased in her Toledo-based district. He noted that the taxpayer watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste named her its "Porker of the Month" in 2010 for earmarks it deemed inappropriate.
Whether you choose a 720p, 1080p or 1080i HD TV, you’ll still be able to watch the same programs -- but 1080p is often referred to as the "true HD experience."

7. Ronnie Magro: To be fair, I didn’t actually speak to Ronnie. No, I waited hours at Manor only to hear later from the club staff that he wouldn’t be doing interviews. I would be miffed if it wasn’t for the fact that Ronnie introduced me to the term “smush.”
A news release Tuesday announced that Sanford's city manager, Norton N. Bonaparte Jr., had selected as interim chief Richard Myers, a 35-year police veteran who formerly headed the Colorado Springs, Colo., police department.
But Romney did not want to trigger a constitutional crisis — seeking, his advisor Flaherty said, to be "respectful of the law and respectful of people at the same time." Initially, he struck a balanced tone with his two-track move to find a legislative solution that would satisfy the court while corralling support for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.
An initiative circulating for California's 2012 state ballot seeks to increase the minimum retirement age to 65 for public employees and teachers, and to 58 for sworn public safety officers.

To lure qualified educators, some districts, including Nevada's Clark County, spent SIG funding on signing bonuses to attract experienced teachers. Indiana and other states turned to alternative training programs such as Teach For America, a New York City-based nonprofit organization that places new college graduates in under-resourced schools. And in Chicago, some schools are partnering with the Academy for Urban School Leadership, where prospective educators spend a "residency" year working with a master teacher.

While construction work hasn't begun and likely won't until the end of the month, the lanes are closed out of caution, Barnes said. Crews are beginning the process of evaluating the damage to the drainage pipes, which they fear could cause a sinkhole in the highway.
I like to get good food at good prices. I don't believe in buying cheap food so I get the circulars from the newspaper each week for Dominick's and Jewel. If I see two chickens for the price of one, I buy them. I clip coupons from the paper as well. Also, I don't buy desserts. I bake my own. For my clothes, I do the same thing. I go to good stores and shop the sales.
It's possible to slash the time frame, and the deaths, if leading industrialized nations pay more attention. President Bush is expected to make an announcement about Washington's commitment to the war on malaria as early as today. We can only hope he builds on the plan proposed by Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, to give commercial biotechnology firms an incentive to create vaccines for diseases such as malaria and HIV. The plan was endorsed in principle this month by the finance ministers of the Group of 8, the club of wealthy nations whose leaders meet starting Wednesday in Gleneagles, Scotland. But that was the easy part; none of the G-8 members have yet been asked to put up any money to pay for it. The price tag will be in the billions &#8212yet it's a bargain given both the humanitarian and economic benefits.
While the Pony will always be identified with the Boss, there were others at this show whose names might not be internationally recognized, but whose reputations have attained bulletproof status in Asbury Park. Just as he had in the ’70s, the leonine Lance Larson took the center microphone for Lord Gunner and Cold Blast and Steel and delivered tough-minded songs such as Warren Zevon’s "Lawyers, Guns and Money." Larson never achieved the fame that some of his peers did, but he has no shortage of charisma, or community-mindedness. In 2003, he began running the Wonder Bar, a few blocks north of the Pony. Springsteen may sing about Asbury Park’s resilience; Larson is a living symbol of it.
"I feel that if my safety could have been ensured I would have wanted to stay," he said. "But now when I look at it, I don't have that kind of hope any more. I now think what I really need is to be with my family and rest."
Whitney is the big brother not only by age. At 6-4 and 261 pounds, he towers over 6-foot, 190-pound Donald, a freshman defensive back at Mount Union College this past season, and the rest of his immediate family. Whitney apparently picked up the size genes from his mother's side of the family.
Debra Kling, a New York-based color consultant and decorator, sees midcentury modern style as grounded in neutral hues. "Simple lines, natural elements like stone and stained wood, and earth tones, punctuated by what I call 'Diner Brights' -- orange, magenta and turquoise," she says.
Tommy Harper, 71, is a former Red Sox outfielder and coach. "We're never going to eradicate that kind of thing, so why worry about it?" he said of the offending posts. "Like any African-American, if I were to respond to every idiot in the world, you could never have a day."
The changes over the past few decades have been as radical in the field of burn treatment as in other areas of medicine -- they just haven't gotten as much attention.
Ironically, this voluntary approach may actually work better than the "do not call" law, which makes it a crime for businesses to cold call phone numbers registered at DoNotCall.gov. I've registered all my phone numbers, but I still get annoying robocalls trying to sell me carpet cleaning, car insurance and a new mortgage.

Portland City Council, a deep knowledge of the city budget and most important, a record of accomplishment on jobs, transportation, parks and public safety -- many of the very areas where this city needs leadership.
The roads are superb. They run for miles in every direction, eight tracks wide where traffic is heavy, with illumination at night, beautiful curves and easy grades, no mean feat of construction when you consider that they never get very far without having to cross a range of mountainous hills. Of course, they are not primarily ornamental: this section, to a greater extent than any other, is dependent on the automobile, as forty years ago it was dependent on the horse. The distances are so vast, the waste of time so cruel if you go by bus or street car, that you must have your own transportation, and whether she needs greasing is literally a matter of greater moment than whether the roof leaks. Everybody has some kind of second- or third- or ninth-hand flivver; even the cook comes to work in her car. Of course, she can't cook when she gets there, but anyhow she arrives in style.
The book begins innocently enough as we meet a high school English teacher, Jake Epping, in - where else? - a small town in Maine.
On the way up the coaching ladder, Meyer turned around programs at Bowling Green and Utah. He coached two national champions, a Heisman winner in Tebow and a No. 1 overall NFL draft choice in Utah's Alex Smith, who is now starting for the 49ers. The coach even slept in the dormitory with the players during two-a-day drills at BG, to show them that he was going through the same thing they were.

How dry we are. By late last month, precipitation was half the normal level in California, and snow runoff was 35% of average, state figures show. Even the recent snows may have come too late to rescue a ski season short on natural white stuff.

"By his own admission, he said he never reached the heights he has achieved in previous years," Spencer said. "You don't always have very good seasons continuously. You will have a down season where nothing goes your way. But that doesn't mean he is a bad player. He's a very good player."

This holiday season, though, his work got a more permanent location - in the atrium at St. Peters City Hall. The tri-level winter scene features 200 figurines, 30 houses, 12 push-button controls and three trains. Reinwald spent three months to come up with the design, and it seems to have gotten him a new fan.
Jesson has expressed serious concerns about those events and recently directed Barry -- a former state health commissioner -- to take command of the division and overhaul it. Part of Barry's charge is to improve death reviews.

Now bulbs do burn out. That's a fact of life, as every homeowner who's stubbed a toe on a chair in a suddenly dark room understands. But the worry is that CPP simply can't keep up with the never-ending troubles of Cleveland's expansive streetlight system: "The system and the process is overwhelmed," Senyak said.

According to a report on Politico.com, "The Medicare actuary's office roughed out some examples to illustrate how the provision would work.

Ascena Retail Group was an exception on an off day, shooting up nearly 10 percent after announcing it will buy Charming Shoppes, the company that owns women's clothing chain Lane Bryant.
This is the first time in its 95-year history that Wycliffe has been challenged from within the evangelical community, and it takes the criticism seriously. At issue is Wycliffe's method of translation, which favors conveying the meaning of Scripture over a literal translation. Instead of explaining a term or concept that is foreign to natives, Wycliffe missionaries try to incorporate something familiar in their translation of the Bible. Instead of "God" they may use "Allah," "Lord" instead of "Father," "Messiah" instead of "Son."

"When you look at the numbers, they are from a snapshot of April 1, 2010, when we were in the midst of a mortgage crisis, foreclosures and the Great Recession," said Don Roe, acting director of planning and urban design for the city. "What was the disruption of people's lives? Were they living with their brother-in-law? How that chessboard lays out, we just don't know."
We are reviewing the use of force, training and tactics. For example, we are taught in the academy that if you meet resistance the safest way for an officer to manage that resistance is to bring them down to the ground. But when you do that we've had some issues where the person has sustained injuries because they go down so quickly. So we're looking to see if there's a way we can manage that a little bit better.

Not predicting victory in Illinois, Santorum said on ABC that despite more than $3 million spent by Romney and his super political action committee in the state, "we're hanging in there, we're fighting, we're climbing, because we have got the best message, the best contrast with President Obama and the best vision for our country."

Many years ago I took a class put on by one of the largest manufacturers of metal brackets, Simpson Strong-Tie. That class was a real eye opener - I realized afterwards that just about every deck that I inspect is constructed wrong. Not all of the installation defects are major, but they're always worth pointing out. Today I'll talk about one of the most common installation defects that I find with joist hangers on Minnesota decks - improper nails.

Like Carter, Harris started off in medicine, first as a medic and later as an ER nurse. He worked at the Alameda County Jail as a nurse. Then he came upon an ad for a job as coroner's investigator. The job appealed to him because he could go straight to investigator without spending years on the street, as a police officer would do on his way to detective.
Anaheim and Santa Maria have a common ancestor, Juan Pacifico Ontiveros . In the mid-1800s, he owned the rancho in what would become north-central Orange County. Believing much of it worthless, in 1857 he sold 1,165 acres for $2 an acre to a consortium of German immigrants. They put in vineyards, laid out a town and named it Anaheim.
Among the more creative appetizers is the Frico ($11), an Asiago cheese crisp paired with salsa and shrimp — an odd combo that turns out to be fun, with its variety of textures that accent the sharp and mild flavors. Roasted artichoke hearts with Hudson Valley goat cheese ($8) are intriguing but require a word of caution: Eat slowly, so the slightly delayed effect of the artichoke’s essence offers contrast to the assertive cheese.
The rising Clackamas River on Friday forced the evacuation of about half the residents of a mobile home park in Carver. Residents were allowed to return later in the day after the water receded.

It seems just about everyone has to have his wisdom teeth extracted. For most, it's an easy procedure and an easy recovery. But many people don't understand why we have those third molars to begin with — or if there are alternatives to removal. We asked Dr. Robert E. Williams, a clinical associate professor at the University of Maryland Dental School who also practices in Baltimore and Bel Air.
He said that after the evacuations, the Sheriff's Office received numerous calls from residents who should have gotten the calls but didn't. When sheriff's workers checked their stories, they determined that no calls were ever sent to those homes, confirming what they said.

The writers have sprinkled in amusing characters here and there and that helps the film's two-plus hours speed by. That very athletic, tantric sex we spoke of earlier was thanks to Jon Hamm playing a handsome jerk in that Jon Hamm way that makes you forget you want someone to slap him. There are Annie's roommates, a strangely appealing British brother and sister act with no sense of boundaries (Matt Lucas and Rebel Wilson, respectively). And Annie's mom, played by the much-missed late Jill Clayburgh in her final role.
While the tussle over the Google Voice app appears to be resolved, policymakers at the FCC and in Congress continue to argue over whether broadband providers should be prohibited from blocking certain applications or discriminating against certain types of data flowing over their networks.

While Chrysler's plants are closed, workers will still receive pay and benefits. Doug Rice, president of the United Auto Workers Local 122 in Twinsburg, said workers should be fine as long as Chrysler emerges from bankruptcy within 60 days.

With all eyes on the capital during the attacks and their aftermath, there was relatively little notice of an incident Monday that pointed to another major ongoing difficulty as Americans intensify their efforts to train and equip Afghan forces: "insider" attacks.

"Brazil has become a positive actor in human rights votes at the United Nations since Rousseff was elected," Vivanco said. "This is a dramatic change from the Lula administration, which used to be on the wrong side of these issues."According to Vivanco, much of the change is due to the fact that Rousseff, as a former political prisoner who suffered from torture, is especially sensitive to human rights issues. "She understands perfectly that a nation's sovereignty cannot be used as an excuse to commit atrocities," he said. "Let's hope this becomes a permanent change in Brazil's policy."

Thankfully for Santorum, that viral video was quickly supplanted by the next one, a gaffe committed by a top Romney advisor who delivered a pithier version of the former senator's criticism of the front-runner. The aide said, memorably, that Romney's views could be erased like an Etch A Sketch for the general election campaign.

Play the consistency card: People will go to great lengths to avoid seeming flaky or wishy-washy. As Cialdini explains in his book, car salesmen exploit this trait by making fantastic "lowball" offers to potential customers. Once a customer decides to buy a car, he's unlikely to want to flake out on the deal even if the price mysteriously balloons — Oops! There was a mistake! — before he gets the keys. Or, for a less slimy example, you're more likely to get that raise or a promotion if you remind your boss that she has a long history of treating her employees well. (Surely she wouldn't want to change her tune now.)

The passion behind St. George's new Terroir gin is rooted in a commute Winters made years ago to collect his son from summer camp in the Oakland Hills. The rich, woodsy scents associated with the close of a warm, central California summer day — pine trees, cedar mulch, coastal sage, birch — stuck. Terroir is typically associated with describing the flavor profile of wines, but in terms of an aroma profile, Winters says, "You don't have to have eaten branches off of a Douglas fir tree (to taste it). You smell it and breathe it in."
She dismissed any threat that the Vikings, who have played in the downtown Minneapolis Metrodome since 1982, would leave Minnesota if a publicly subsidized stadium is not approved soon.

"If you ask Todd to catch the ball for six outs, then you start weighing the decision in your mind and wonder if you would have been better off just ramping him up for the entire game because of the intensity he brings," Tracy said. "Six outs are like 27 for him. You have to balance it a little bit, but you also need options on our bench, especially if there's a game to take to the bank."

Christie predicted he and the Legislature would negotiate a budget by June 30 "most people probably won't like,'' but will ultimately support, "if they believe that in the end we are working for what is in the greater public interest and not the interest of one narrow constituency.

That's why I think this team will keep its focus for the rest of the year."

News of O'Connor's decommitment spread fast.
The district is following regulations by not counting the signatures of parents who have left the district, but the deck is stacked against the trigger proponents. Despite a requirement that reasonable steps be taken to verify signatures, district officials have blocked progress on various technicalities during the process. They invalidated signatures of parents whose children had no emergency cards on file; the cards contain a parent signature, allowing for easy verification. But it's the district's responsibility to get those cards, which are needed in urgent situations. They also never warned the petitioners in advance that it would be necessary to obtain extra signatures to replace those of parents who moved away.

The Big East announced earlier this week that it will try to expand to 12 members in football and reportedly has already contacted UCF about joining its meager ranks in the next few days. But in the league's current sorry state, the Knights must be feeling a little like Groucho Marx, who once said, "I refuse to join any club that would have me as a member!"
A similar shift is needed today in the fight against America's expanding waistlines, many experts believe. Instead of approaching obesity as a personal issue, it needs to be redefined as a community challenge that calls for collective action and wide-ranging policy changes such as more informative food labels, limits on marketing to children, and taxes on unhealthy products, they argue.

Laura Trevelyan, a BBC correspondent based in New York, is particularly interested in the extent to which the choices will mirror those "at William's parents' wedding. Diana personally chose the hymn I Vow To Thee My Country, which was also played at her funeral. William has talked about his mother, and he gave Kate her ring, so that hymn would have a lot of resonance."
There's nothing subtle about Giambi, from his tattoos to his biceps to a mustache that he can seemingly grow between innings. He brings swagger into the batter's box.

Purists may sit on their hands, but Schiff argues persuasively that standard histories of last century's music betray tired prejudices, including the divide between commercial popularity and artistic integrity, difficulty and accessibility, control and spontaneity. Ellington straddled this divide. He played the Cotton Club and Carnegie Hall, in dives and cathedrals. He wrote "In a Sentimental Mood" and concert works such as "Black, Brown and Beige," a musical narrative of black history from Africa to Harlem. He was the most advanced jazz harmonist of his day and his later music has a spiritual fervor, much like Johann Sebastian Bach's.

Understandably, you’re grasping for control and privacy -- probably because you give up much of both in online dating. But, consider the ridiculousness: You’re standing firm on telephonic privacy after posting your picture and hopes and dreams like you’re a pair of shoes for sale on eBay. And you actually don’t need to “give a stranger several ways to access (you)”; just explain that you aren’t comfortable giving out your number, and ask for his. Use caller ID blocking to keep your number from being displayed (dial *67 before dialing his number), or call from Skype.

One traditional wound treatment is to graft in sections of dermis and muscle from elsewhere in the body, but that creates a second wound. Alternatively, surgeons already have artificial materials (called dermal templates) they can sew in to promote regrowth. In either case, the new material requires contact with healthy soft tissue and a blood supply — which isn't possible if the wound is bone-deep or if the surrounding tissue has been irradiated to shrink a tumor.

A: Veuve Clicquot. I'm not lying. I even write about it in my first book. When I was growing up we had a family friend who would put a case of it in the trunk of our car whenever we visited. I grew up thinking it was table wine. Later, when I was in college and my roommates and I decided to throw a party we wanted to serve Veuve Clicquot. I went to the store and put six bottles on the counter. The clerk told me the price, so I went to pay. Then he told me that it was the price for just one bottle. I couldn't believe it. My mother, realizing I couldn't afford it, sent me a check the next day. It was the best party I ever threw.

Last week Sissy Spacek said she was expecting "a real gullywasher" of a rainstorm. She's the rare movie star who could make such a remark without sounding like she's rehearsing a role. Born in Quitman, Texas, Ms. Spacek now lives on a farm at the foot of Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains. Her experiences in these two hamlets bookend her new memoir and, in the Oscar winner's telling, kept her anchored through an unusually steady film career, which took off with "Carrie" (1976) and "Coal Miner's Daughter" (1980), and later included the searing drama "In the Bedroom" (2001) and the hit "The Help" (2011).

Going from being a 17-15 team that finished 6-10 in the ACC to being an NCAA tournament team is certainly not an automatic for Mark Turgeon’s team regardless of a recruiting class ranked as high as 13th in the country, but considering how competitive the Terps were until Pe’Shon Howard went down with a season-ending knee injury in early February, you have to believe the five recruits are going to help make for a quick transformation.

Helm kept busy after the Band's "Last Waltz" in 1976, playing with his own RCO All-Stars and acting in several movies, including "Coal Miner's Daughter" and "The Right Stuff." His deep identification with the music scene in Woodstock, N.Y., which began in the '60s, intensified as he aged. After his initial recovery from throat cancer, he began hosting jams in his Woodstock studio; these evolved into the Midnight Rambles, a series of concerts that drew Elvis Costello, Donald Fagen, Rickie Lee Jones and other notable musicians to participate and pay respects to Helm.
Most of the buildings that may reopen are already being used by the district for alternative programs that could be moved elsewhere - such as the Fresh Start program to help dropouts earn high school diplomas in the Meda P. Washington building on South Vandeventer Avenue. That building could become an elementary school for 300 children. The program would move to Beaumont High School, which would also accommodate other alternative education programs that may need to relocate.
Among their concerns: the high profile September 2006 death of James P.

The best defense for everyone is to wear brimmed hats and sunglasses that screen 99 to 100 percent of UV rays. Brimmed hats alone will block about 50 percent of UV radiation. Ideally, all types of eyewear should absorb at least the full spectrum of UV rays including UV-A and UV-B. The degree of UV protection is not necessarily related to the price of the sunglasses. Most rigid contact lenses also provide UV protection -- but because contact lenses don't cover the entire eye, it's still important to wear sunglasses when you're outdoors.
In the big scheme of things, I suppose, this isn't earth-shattering. Given that the public has been forced to watch for well over a year as a parade of local businessmen and public officials have been convicted on corruption charges involving county work and county officials, Headen is a small fry.

With the game in hand  the Bulls were up by 12 with 1:10 to go  the question is: Why was Rose still in the game? "Yeah, I don't work backwards like you guys do. The score was going the other way," Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said. Sixers forward Andre Iguodala wasn't surprised Rose was still in the game: "It's the playoffs. Some things happen at times. You can't fault a guy being in." Iguodala later wrote on Twitter, "Prayers for DRose " Asked about the timing of Rose's injury, Thibodeau said, "It's part of the game. There are going to be injuries. You can get hurt any time. You've got to deal with it. He's had a lot of injuries this year, it's unfortunate. But we'll deal with it." Sixers coach Doug Collins said the injury was "awful. "When I play teams I want to beat them at their best. I hope the kid comes back," Collins said before the extent of the injury was known.

Irene Breshears said the wounded soldier represents Army Spec. Warren E. Newton of Canby, who was 18 on Jan. 9, 1968, when he went missing in action. The soldier carrying Newton represents Marine Pfc. Gary W. Martini, a Portlander who was awarded the Medal of Honor for rescuing two other Marines during a firefight that killed him at age 18 on April 21, 1967.
This week, someone leaked information that Martin had been suspended from school for possessing an empty marijuana baggie. It was also reported that Zimmerman claims Martin attacked him from behind, a version of events supposedly corroborated by witnesses. This would contradict other witnesses (the ones police initially blew off or never even bothered to contact) who paint Zimmerman as the aggressor who followed and shot a black kid he found 'suspicious."

Two big caveats: The College Board math assumes everyone goes to a public college. Those usually cost less than private ones—often a lot less—and that skews returns higher.

Dear Tommy: That woman over there, the one wearing reading glasses on top of her sunglasses and looking ridiculous? That was me. So, I completely understand your problem. There are three relatively inexpensive ways to resolve your problem. Online you'll find reading sunglasses either bifocal (with the bottom half magnified) or full lens magnification. Some drugstores stock these. Online and at craft stores, you can buy flip-up-and-down magnifiers that clip on to regular glasses or sunglasses. They look a little silly but they do the job. Finally, there's stick-on magnifiers that adhere to your own sunglasses. I've tried all of these options (amazon.com is a good place to start) and they do work. Costs range up to about $30, which is, as you know, lots cheaper than investing in prescription glasses which, inevitably, you'll lose. Or is that just me?
