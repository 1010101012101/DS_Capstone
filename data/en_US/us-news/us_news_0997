Old government records note that a patent was issued in 1884 to Marcellus Edson of Montreal, Canada, for his heated peanut paste which had "a consistency like ointment."

Circadia: Minimalism in game design is a lost art, especially as the iPad increasingly becomes a powerful mobile gaming device. "Circadia" encourages a gamer to slow down and smell the roses. With its simple interface and soothing chimes, "Circadia" is an unassuming and enjoyable music puzzle game that tests your eyes' and ears' coordination. The various colored dots chime different tones, which pulse a ring at different speeds. The player's objective is to time the pulsing rings to hit the white dot (or dots) at the same time. Some might find "Circadia" frustrating with its trial-and-error approach. But this simple and elegant game also challenges your patience and encourages sonic experimentations. (99 cents)

But that is what they were there to say, that a March 28 Daily News story by Dana DiFilippo and Phillip Lucas entitled “Dirty Dancing” defamed them.

An America that gave my grandparents the chance to buy a home because of the Federal Housing Authority. An America that gave their children and grandchildren the chance to fulfill our dreams thanks to college loans and college scholarships.It was an America where you didn't buy things you couldn't afford; where we didn't just think about today – we thought about tomorrow. An America that took pride in the goods it made, not just in the things it consumed. An America where a rising tide really did lift all boats, from the company CEO to the guy on the assembly line.

In the 17-minute video, Huff suggests that he was stopped without the officer having probable cause, as required by law, and that Reichert coached his K-9 dog to detect a scent of drugs so that he would have a reason to search Huff's car.

The Afghan leader's comments were likely to intensify the sense of crisis that has begun to permeate the relationship between the United States and Afghanistan in recent weeks.

Influence aside—and one might argue that the Vervoordt look, if it can be so described, has already been widely disseminated at more comfortable price points by the Belgian chain Flamant—it's an open question whether what works in a Belgian chateau easily translates, in anything but raw size (another common critique of Restoration's products), to an Orange County McMansion. For some, Restoration seems too male (indeed, the store attracts a higher percentage of male shoppers than other furnishings stores); others see in chairs upholstered in airplane metal and rivets, or lamps made from Royal Marine Tripods, a sort of "steampunk" aesthetic. These are not neutral positions, and it's definitely his head he's laying on the line, as witnessed by his photograph and letter in the catalog.

It sells more automobiles than any other country, too (it passed the United States last year). And all those bad numbers are still going up, because China's No. 1 goal is increasing industrial production, not protecting the environment.

Unfortunately, a small number of students made a very bad choice last night, which has led to the loss of valuable learning time for our students, expensive clean-up costs and repair costs for broken and damaged items and furniture.
Sitting pretty: Ohio Republicans can probably forget about Rep. Steve LaTourette of Bainbridge Township challenging Sen. Sherrod Brown next year. With the GOP back in control of the House -- and his pal John Boehner as speaker -- LaTourette is a very happy camper these days. He's not only on the powerful Appropriations Committee, he was just named to the Smithsonian Institution's 17-member Board of Regents, where he serves with Chief Justice John Roberts and Vice President Joe Biden. No wonder LaTourette would rather see some other Republican -- maybe Rep. Jim Jordan of Urbana or Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor -- take on a very difficult Senate fight.

The challenge: Mary Beth and Scott Timmington's Colonial-syle home in Minnetonka was stuck in the 1970s. The couple planned an extensive main-floor remodel, including the living room, dining room and kitchen.

People tend to underestimate calories, fat, sugar and sodium they are eating, he says, so there is a strong public health rationale for them to be provided with that information -- including students on college campus, who might be creating lifetime habits.
It doesn't take much effort to see Collins' novel -- set mostly in a capital city populated by wealthy elites who sip brightly-hued cocktails and watch teenagers stab, maim and impale one another -- as a screed against the one-percent. As the story unfolds, the leaders keep changing the rules of the Games to eke out higher ratings and to suppress possible rebellion among angry viewers. In a slightly more familiar vein, the novel also functions as a bitter satire of a society that's so completely lost its moral compass that anything suffices as entertainment.

Worst documentary: Now that all you need to pass yourself off as a nonfiction filmmaker is a video camera — and an agenda — this genre is getting awfully crowded. But there was still plenty of room at the bottom for “The Soprano State,” a movie which took a good idea — New Jersey’s carnival of corruption — and padded it out with stupid songs and awful stand-up from Tony (“Ba-da-BING!”) Darrow.

Voters who deserted the two mainstays of Greek politics in droves headed to a cluster of smaller parties on both the left and right, including the extremist Golden Dawn, which rejects the neo-Nazi label and insists it is nationalist patriotic. The movement has been blamed for violent attacks on immigrants and ran on an anti-immigrant platform, vowing to "clean up" Greece and calling for land mines to be planted along the country's borders. The party looked set to win about 7 percent of the vote, giving it 21 deputies in parliament — a stunning rise for a group that earned just 0.29 percent of the vote in 2009.

Mike Bianchi, Orlando Sentinel: "A writer in Huntington, W.

The 400-plus-year-old Sultan Ahmet Mosque — better known as the Blue Mosque for its magnificent interior decoration of 20,000 blue Iznik tiles — is spiritual home to several million Muslims. This bastion of Islam faces the basilica of Hagia Sophia (St. Sophia), begun in the fourth century by the emperor Constantine the Great, who was a Christian. Neither place should be missed. St. Sophia, now a museum known for its splendid mosaics, is generally acknowledged as one of the great buildings of the world, although it's not Constantine's original. It's the third incarnation of the church, built between 532 and 537 A.D. by Emperor Justinian I.

And when Pujols is doing poorly, the slumps provide material for the haters. And the ensuing noise creates even more of a perception that there's a massive freak-out over Pujols.

My parents still live here, I have a lot of good friendships with people here. If I could, this is where I would raise a family. It's just everything about it. We have a mix of all different types of families, people that care greatly about the school. There’s something I see that’s just different about Glenelg.

Kaminski: But to be fair, Sarkozy has been saying a lot of the same things, too. He ran as a very sort of centrist, market reformer. And he's sort of lost his way. And I'm not sure--I think Hollande may dabble with some of this stuff early on and may end up getting a visit from his minister of finance and/or central bank governor, saying, "You can't do this." And in a way, you know, France needs a change, and Sarkozy's been a disappointment in so many ways.

Hopefully the online program will allow students who learn in alternative ways to succeed when they otherwise might not have.
In 2010, NPI hired a consultant to evaluate deconstruction in Cleveland, including why it didn't pay for itself. The quality of the buildings taken down emerged as a major factor -- they were in such bad shape, with such limited architectural value, that little was left to reclaim. The homes also tended to be devoid of cabinets, plumbing, fixtures and other items that could be sold, sometimes because scrappers had stripped them. As a result, a deconstructed single-family home averaged only a maximum of $750 in salvageables, the report said.
"I will be focused on my game, but in my heart, I will be hoping Brazil wins in the World Cup," said Eduardo.
Oklahoma City also took three of four against the Mavs in the regular season. These two franchises have met three times in the postseason, last year's matchup in the West finals, which Dallas won in five games, as well as in 1984 and '87 when the Thunder were known as the Seattle SuperSonics. Dallas won in '84 while Seattle rebounded in '87.

Raves about the Purple Palm made me eager to stay at the hotel. Yet I immediately felt out of place with a child in this romantic, fine-dining establishment. One look at the menu with a $29 wild boar entree and a $14 veal marrow appetizer and I sensed trouble. Was there a children's menu? No, the waiter said. Could my son order a hamburger? No, again, but he could have side dishes from the dinner entrees. The waiter offered no guidance when I tried to envision the taste profiles -- or how anyone, including a child, would like such sides as purple Thai rice with the litchi-Merlot-black truffle glacé.
In "They Eat Puppies, Dont They?," his first book since the justly acclaimed 2009 memoir "Losing Mum and Pup," Buckley confidently works the familiar territory of Washington, D.C., then manages to write convincingly, and hilariously, about the ruling elite of China.
People may not remember, but Mazzone was a quarterbacks coach at Colorado State many years ago. He also has coached under Tommy Tuberville, Dennis Erickson, Eric Mangini (with the Jets) and, ultimately, took a job with Jim Mora (Jr.) at UCLA. Mazzone worked with Rivers at North Carolina State. (Remember my back story. Sexton is the agent for Tebow and Rivers.) I know that Zeke Bratkowski, who worked with both Rivers and Tebow before they turned pro, wants to spend more time with Tebow, and a number of other former coaches have called Tebow's people about spending time with him. Everybody has a solution.

Neighbors voiced their distaste for the home, fearing for their safety, their children's safety and their property values.
The $150 million penalty is the largest ever levied by the SEC for a violation of that kind, he said, noting that the settlement also calls for internal changes to be made by Bank of America to avoid future violations of disclosure rules. "The settlement was based on a thorough and objective assessment of the facts and the law, and sends a strong message that companies must give shareholders all material information about corporate transactions subject to shareholder approval," Nester said in a statement.
Mater Dei tied it at 15 on baskets from Schulte and Koelling, and the Knights reclaimed the lead on a Richards steal and assist to Avoynna Kampwerth. But Nashville tied it up on a Shaye Harre layup that barely beat the halftime buzzer, which made it 19-19.
"A lot of people have been looking at 1,350 as the short-term correction level, a level that the buy-the-dip crowd was hoping to get. This doesn't mean the market is not focusing on Europe," James Dailey, a fund manager at TEAM Financial Asset Management, told Reuters.

In some school systems, including St. Louis Public Schools, test scores can play a role in determining whether a principal keeps his or her job. They determine whether a school is penalized under the federal No Child Left Behind law. And they determine whether an unaccredited district, such as St. Louis and Riverview Gardens, regains a more favorable standing with the state.
In a ruling issued late Thursday, U.S. District Judge James Cacheris tossed out part of an indictment against two men charged with illegally reimbursing donors to Hillary Clinton's 2006 Senate and 2008 presidential campaigns.

øThe most exciting dinosaur app for the iPad, Inside the World of Dinosaurs delivers a magical learning experience. Each of the 60 dinosaurs can be viewed up close, in scale-revealing detail. Kids can also watch the dinosaurs move in 3D animation, fully rotate 3D images and hear the dinosaurs make sounds. There are other dinosaur encyclopedias in the app stores, but actor Stephen Fry's outstanding narration delivered in his excitingly droll voice draws you in. With great navigation (you can enter via an interactive timeline, an index or grouping buttons on the bottom of the screen), this app is hard to put down.
Murdoch dropped the takeover bid for BSkyB in mid-2011, after the furor over phone hacking.
"They're each talking about roughly 400,000 square feet of retail space," he said.

UC Provost Lawrence Pitts said he disagreed with the findings and insisted that UC allows plenty of intellectual debate. "UC's scholarly success nationally and internationally would not be possible if our faculty were doctrinaire and not subject to having their work forged in the marketplace of ideas," he said.
The Monkees were derisively nicknamed the "Prefab Four," and not unreasonably so; if you watch the Beatles in "A Hard Day's Night" and then watch "The Monkees," the imitation is conspicuous. But you can't blame the boys, who, after all, answered an ad for a cattle-call audition and won the roles. Credit must go to out-of-touch Hollywood types who only saw four cute boys being chased by screaming teenage girls.
The S&P index traded below its 200-day moving average of 1,280. Many traders use moving averages as benchmarks for when to buy and sell. Orlando said the S&P could fall to 1,250 or lower over the next few days as investors begin to doubt the strength of the economy.

In fairness, the dinner menu is the star of the show (eight steaks, seafood, chicken, pork, pasta, $9.95 to $26.95; smoked prime rib Fridays and Saturdays). The Nelsons cobbled together the current lunch menu ($5.95 to $12.95), and will debut a revised version in about two weeks, Danielle said.

Champ won the State Fair and Sacramento County junior titles this summer. But it was his runner-up finish in his first American Junior Golf Association event, the Hunter Mahan Championship in Texas, earlier this year that attracted attention.

Now, the Browns can do themselves and him a favor by cutting ties. Brandon Weeden would be on the fast-track if he were a 23-year-old No. 1 pick. He'll be 29 in October. There's no time to waste. They need to clear the path for him. That's harder with McCoy here.
The album's title is a reference to the street where he was raised in Orlando, and the project had its roots in his desire merely to personally document some of his songs in the wake of becoming a father. After collaborating with Orlando's in-demand producer Justin Beckler, a stack of 30 songs was culled down to a manageable 11 tracks that illustrated Matchett's appreciation for both the indie and pop sides of the music realm.

While mayor, he spent several hundred thousand dollars to buy just less than 1,000 acres of bog and round land along both sides of the White River between 16th and 38th streets.

This one is delicious -- Rick Perry vs. George H. W. Bush. I'm sorry, but Perry is Fred Thompson on steroids. To be clear, Thompson was actually a pretty damn good lawyer who has some intellectual heft to him -- although he hid it rather well in his 2008 race. On the contrary, Perry literally can't string two sentences together. His performance before the Values Voters Summit was universally panned. Perry couldn't give a good speech with all the time in the world to prepare. We are now told the problem is that he doesn't get enough sleep. Break out the Lunesta -- Rick Perry is coming storming back! Note to the Perry campaign: You are supposed to give him the Lunesta after the debate, not before. I know Perry speaks some Spanish but I don't believe "debate" translates to "siesta." Bush was a war hero, a successful entrepreneur, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, ambassador to the United Nations, U.S. envoy to China, and chairman of the Republican National Committee. George H. W. Bush went on to serve as vice president and president of the United States. Sorry, Rick, I don't see you filling those shoes anytime soon.

Experts are still debating what's driving the numbers --whether it's a true surge in autism, or a reflection of changing definitions and diagnostic techniques.

A common factor in all these diets is that meals are based on whole foods. There's no arguing the benefits of such a diet, especially when plant foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans take center stage.

We reviewed the evidence to cut through the confusion and bring you the best diet for your heart health.

Remember roll call? The U.S. Senate has roll call too, and if you'll remember third grade, you'll know that roll call starts with the letter "A." In the Senate, that would be "A" for Akaka, as in Daniel Akaka, a Democrat from Hawaii. Near the end of the alphabet is "W," and when his name is called in the roll call, Ron Wyden, Democrat from Oregon, responds with his vote.

If the Bulls can finish on a 60-game pace for the second consecutive season -- which would be a .732 winning percentage, 48 wins -- they would become the seventh Chicago team to reach that mark. But there is an incomplete quality, though. The first five teams Bulls teams to finish .732 or better ('90-91, '91-92, '95-96, '96-97, '97-98, '98-99) all won championships, led by Michael Jordan.

OKLAHOMA CITY -- A year after Republicans swept into office across the country, many have trained their sights on what has long been a fiscal conservative's dream: the steep reduction or even outright elimination of state income taxes.
"I walk on the idyllic and Edenic Willamette campus everyday and wonder whose life I am leading -- it still seems surreal," she says. "My grandma, she lived in Northern Thailand. She had a fourth-grade education. She had no running water in her house. What can happen in a few generations!"

“The first North American music that influenced me was from films,” he said. “They had marvelous themes that would stay in your head, like ‘Vertigo,’ or ‘The Man With the Golden Arm.’ They have remained in our collective memory.”
Which marriage did we want to preserve — the one where the guy first marries a woman, then her sister, then both of their servants? Or the one with 700 concubines? Or are we preserving modern marriage, which are lifelong commitments that can last 72 hours (or less!) and end in divorce half the time? Good luck with that one.

Some revelations in the book:
And what if the kitchen takes foie gras and makes ice cream? Then turns it into a lighter-than-air powder by spinning it in a space-age machine called the PacoJet? The result: a flavor that suggests foie gras and a texture that touches the tongue and  poof  disappears in an instant.
More and more, specialists question whether our society and culture fuel overeating.
This just isn't true. Though I do believe DeVos should bring in an independent basketball mind from outside the Magic family to give the franchise a fresh perspective, I refuse to believe the Magic are a bad organization. In fact, I think the Magic are a good organization. Just not a great one.
There are also amitraz tick collars, which kill ticks upon contact -- before they can transmit disease. Do not use amitraz collars or permethrins on cats, as they are toxic for them; Fipronil is toxic for rabbits. Lastly, your dog can be given a Lyme vaccine, if you live in a populated tick area.
A decade ago, only four states offered rebates or tax incentives for film production. Now the balance is almost reversed. This can't be an accident or a case of mindless follow-the-leader, of course. These lawmakers across the land can't all be wearing rose-colored glasses. It simply isn't possible — is it? — that the only real winners from this flurry of legislative activity are the movie makers themselves.
The July decrease represented a 1.8 percent decline in percentage terms and followed a 0.5 percent drop in June. The only increase in credit that has occurred since January 2009 was a small 1 percent rise in January of this year.
The 360 saves by themselves would rank eighth all time, just ahead of Troy Percival (358) and just behind Jeff Reardon (367). Of course, that is not a true list because Rivera already sits atop the heap with 603 saves — even after blowing the season opener against the Rays.

Soft-shell clams are unable to close their shells completely. To determine whether they are alive, gently touch the protruding neck of each clam to see if it will retract. If the neck does not retract slightly, discard the clam. Discard any clams with cracked or broken shells.

So the Rams stuck to their board even if it meant not drafting a running back, offensive guard or defensive tackle. The Rams did take an outside linebacker in Jabara Williams, of Stephen F. Austin, but not until Round 7. Similarly, they didn't take a cornerback until Round 7 when they selected Baylor's Mikail Baker, a converted wide receiver who missed most of two season in college because of collarbone (2007) and knee (2009) injuries.

The history: Soter, a winemaking consultant to some of the top Cabernet Sauvignon brands in wine country, started Etude in 1982. He named it after the French word for study.
"There was a lot of emotion," Senini recalls 10 years later. "I compare it to Pearl Harbor, but this wasn't an island in the Pacific; it was our nation's capital and New York. It was painful and daunting and frightening to all of us. But at the same time, we were fricking excited to be a small part of going up against the people who attacked us."
Moments after a knock-down struggle with a man who tried to shoplift two cases of beer from a Southeast Portland Fred Meyer, a security guard raced to the opposite end of the store to answer an emergency alarm.
Later, a more intense advocacy campaign will start. The campaigns won't know how much they have to spend until all donations come in, but they are expecting to put a total of about $8 million toward both parts, with the majority going to the later advocacy, Brantley said. For that, they have hired traditional political workers who are ready to lead phone banks and door-to-door campaigning.
Students without stellar grades and test scores might have better luck looking for scholarships in their backyard than applying for national awards that attract tens of thousands of applicants, says Kalman Chany, author of "Paying for College Without Going Broke."

He remembered the time Knight came into the huddle while his team trailed 11 points with less than three minutes on the clock and asked the time for practice the next day, coolly taking over the game’s final minutes. Or the time he stole a pass in the waning seconds when his team trailed by one to sink the winner. Or the time at a tournament in Ohio when Knight hit a three-pointer before the buzzer over a team named — get this — Princeton.
"It is all about the will and desperation," Briere said. "We have to get that back. So far in this series, we have only had it for about three periods. There is no sense in me telling you how good we are. You guys have seen us all year. You know if we are good or not. One thing I can tell you is that we need to have more desperation if we want to get back to winning games."

What: OK, so you're not looking forward to making a mess in the kitchen trying to whip up a Mother's Day feast come May 13. You don't have to! Instead, treat Mom to a day of baseball as the River Cats continue their tradition of Mother's Day at the ballpark. In addition to the afternoon game against the Iowa Cubs, the River Cats are offering a Mother's Day brunch ticket package, which includes a game ticket, pre-game brunch (bacon and eggs, pastries, muffins, etc.), a $10 Macy's gift card and BeneFit cosmetics gift pack.

No trip, be it in 1965 or 2008, would be complete without the 32-mile drive up the Avenue of the Giants. This is the oldest of old Highway 101, back when engineers didn't lightly uproot the giants, but instead swung the road around them, more blacktop path than highway.

Whenever an issue emerges with a team -- whether it be a rough run of starting pitching, or a hitting drought with runners in scoring position -- the real question is what it means in the long term. Are the results a function of a team enduring the typical fluctuations of a season? Or are they an indication of some fatal flaw in its construction?
The Shakes collaborated on the music on Boys & Girls, but Howard tends to handle the lyrics herself.

The dearth of feedback has only worsened in recent years, as budget cuts have thinned the ranks of assistant principals, who are often responsible for evaluations.
You've seen them at the mall, on the red carpet and maybe even in your own closet: booties and boots that hug the foot, are snug against the ankle, maybe encase the leg to the knee or above - but leave the toes peeking out from a small opening, exposed to the elements. What was once a demure peek-a-boo detail on pumps worn by boundary-pushing 1940s pinup girls has evolved into what often looks like the foot and ankle have been mummified, with the toes forgotten.
Paula Mitchell, who owns Paula's Moms and Proms, has been catering to clients shopping for prom dresses and mother-of-the-bride looks for more than two decades. She and her daughter Hollie Mitchell, who buys many of the store's prom styles, share these suggestions on making the dress shopping process more pleasant.

And what general wouldn't want them? Robots are, in many ways, better soldiers than humans. They don't get tired, hungry or have to go the bathroom - drone aircraft can keep their eyes on a target for as much as 30 hours without refueling. They don't panic when the robot next to them gets shot; their sensors cut right through the fog of war. Because they don't have to be fed, clothed, hospitalized or paid pensions, they're cheaper. Best of all, as Rutgers law professor Richard M. O'Meara (a retired U.S. Army brigadier general) noted, when a robot gets killed, nobody has to write a letter to the parents.
Leif Eskesen, chief economist for India and Asean at HSBC, said Wednesday that while output growth moderated partly due to power outages, new orders continued to pour in, including for exports, signaling a marked improvement in business conditions.

That law isn't intended to limit the rights of a person to use deadly force under the state's castle doctrine, City Attorney Rob Heggie said.
"It's not something we'd bring up there," the mayor said. "I am hoping other council members feel the same way. All that could do is bring a negative image to the city."Rossbach said the city had some bad publicity involving city officials a few years ago.

For a chardonnay that hasn't seen oak, the 2010 nevertheless is deceptively complex. It isn't heavy or thick. It's lithe and spirited, with smells and flavors that suggest tropical fruits, apples and citrus. Suggestions of both lime and kaffir lime leaves help account for its brightness and crispness.
Poznanovich knew there was a problem because he usually pays his renewal fees in May and had not received a bill. He called the DMV and was told to sit tight until the state decided what the fees would be. "The part of the story I wasn't sure about was why our Legislature did this. It seems kind of dumb to me," he says.

A: Hey, Zach: Yes, I checked with the league and there is no "games played" requirement. His eligibility status is secure. By now, you know Irving is back and playing.

It's equally about growing up. Like many denizens of so-called mumblecore films—low-budget productions that put a high premium on drift—Doug hasn't found his direction, nevermind his bliss. Nonetheless, he seems to know it, and is energized by adventure, however quixotic it proves to be. One difficulty with this film is that Doug is the least vital of the three main characters; he has mastered mildness as a second language. Another is the zone in which the film operates, equidistant between droll and dull. If that's a comfort zone for you, "Cold Weather" may be worth a look-see. Andrew Reed did the handsome photography. The drums and gongs of Keegan DeWitt's Balinese-tinged music provide the story with a needed pulse.

Newsom has his defenders, folks who look at the lieutenant guv's 2011 Economic Growth and Competitiveness Agenda and believe Brown should give his lieutenant a platform. Newsom's former political consultant Garry South argued that, as a onetime big-city mayor, policy wonk and successful businessman, Newsom is "legitimately frustrated because he's got a lot of policy depth and executive experience" - but Brown has frozen out Newsom.

It's partly the size, of course. Scouts say few players at any level can do the things Carr does, but to see a guy no bigger than the kid scooping fries at McDonald's catapulting to the rim, crashing dunks and distributing bullet passes makes for great theater. It's also his biggest stumbling block.

Hiking on dunes is tiring, even — or perhaps especially — when they're singing to you. So it's time for lunch. Seven miles past the dune turnoff is Kelso Depot, a 1924 outpost where trains stopped for water and passengers to dine. After the frenetic World War ll years — iron for Liberty ships passed through here — the depot entered a long decline. Reopened in 2005, after a meticulous restoration, this Spanish Revival structure is now a charming and genteel counterpoint to the endless surrounding miles of Mojave wilderness.
The Oregon Department of Transportation announced last week it will close the rest area — the only public one on U.S. 26 between Portland and Madras — on Halloween, part of the department's effort to trim 2 percent of its maintenance costs.

The biggest question might be just how motivated the Spurs (61-19) will be. The lone remaining thing they have to accomplish is best record in the NBA, and they have a one-game lead on Chicago. The advantage to having a better record than the Bulls is it would give San Antonio homecourt advantage should they meet in the NBA Finals. But would put that potential edge above resting top players?
It would be something in the range between 3 1/2 and five hours of charging, and it would probably be at 40 to 80 amps. These could be in the home, if the home had that capacity.

The Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, along with a handful of prison-advocacy groups, submitted a petition to the U.N. requesting an on-site investigation of conditions in California's Security Housing Units, the segregated cells where prisoners suspected of gang involvement are placed.

Q: Hey, Tony: I was extremely surprised to hear you say last week, "Mangini can't have more losses than wins if he wants to keep his job." Most experts predict us to be one of the worst teams in the NFL. Don't you think six or seven wins at least gives him shot? Trust me, I would love to go straight to nine or 10 wins, but reality is that is not common in Year 2 of a rebuild. Do you really want another new coach?! -- Michael Spitale, Galena, Ohio

Soccer players, even with an age group requirement in the Olympics, are not consumed by thoughts of a gold medal. The World Cup is their Holy Grail. NBA players and tennis players don't qualify, either. Every season offers championships and major tournaments. In 2016, golf will become an Olympic sport. No sane golfer would say an Olympic gold medal is more valuable than a Masters green jacket. It's simply a different order of dreaming.

If MetroHealth's rating were downgraded a notch, its debt rating would still be considered an upper medium grade and subject to low credit risk.

So you are at the base of the tower in 15 minutes, but the tourist line to get on the elevator looks as if it will take your remaining 45. Not going up will save you the claustrophobic ride, plus the $5 fare. You don't have to pay to see the 1930s Public Works Art Project murals that wrap around the interior concourse. One picture window looks over the Ferry Building to the Bay Bridge, and the other looks through the trees to the Golden Gate Bridge. It makes you wonder if the view from the top is really $5 and 30 minutes better.
Jim Campbell, CenturyLink's regional vice president for legislative affairs, said the measure would hurt the company's consumers who would have to pay more for service without the subsidy.

There's certainly a crisis in civics today, but it's the product of a profound disconnect between our political engagement and our moral engagement.
