Out of 171 transit agencies surveyed recently, TriMet boasted the fourth highest insurance premiums in the country.

Gadaldi and his partners, Adriano Paganini and Deborah Blum, have also worked hard to perfect the service and achieve the right balance; the staff is efficient, but casual and friendly.

Two drinks is my limit, and even at that I was feeling no pain.

Warwick was one of them. Before she was 10, she’d already performed a gospel solo; by the time she was 11, she was singing in the choir at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark.

Young Dionne filled in with the Drinkard Singers and got her musical education there. By the late ’50s, she and her sister Dee Dee Warwick formed a gospel singing group of their own — the Gospelaires, whose first concert was held at the Apollo Theater.

In fact, a fascinating New York Times magazine story in June, "Living the Good Lie," examined the phenomenon of those whose religious identity, often including a belief that homosexual behavior is sinful, is more important to them than their gay identity. Writer Mimi Swartz looks at therapists, including openly gay therapists, who help clients live in light of what is most important to them - instead of trying to convince them to believe and live as the therapist might like. So, for instance, this could mean encouraging a Christian gay man who wants to stay faithfully married to his wife to be open with her about his orientation, and develop strategies for not becoming involved with men.

"As Catholics," another passage says, "we are led to raise questions for political life other than 'Are you better off than you were two or four years ago?' Our focus is not on party affiliation, ideology, economics, or even competence and capacity to perform duties, as important as such issues are. Rather, we focus on what protects or threatens human life and dignity."
Bynum and the Lakers' big men even successfully defended the pick-and-roll, an oddity for this team for, oh, the past 15 years or so.
A United States pinched by economic realities cannot continue to wage war without end. With their high-tech requirements, vast nation-building needs and the expanding template of severe injury to U.S. military personnel that they involve, these open-ended conflicts are just page one of a lengthening due bill.
Every plate that comes to your table reveals his experience, whether it's the fiery aguachile raw shrimp or scallops, the grilled snapper with tart, ruby-red hibiscus flower sauce, beef tenderloin (solomillo) encrusted with Spanish cabrales blue cheese and finished with a brandy reduction, or generously large shrimp smothered in a delicate tequila, mango and guajillo chile sauce.
While a student at Arizona State University, Holly Huntimer made purchases using credit cards without really pondering the consequences. The Surprise woman, now 27, earned her bachelor's degree with relatively little in the way of student loans, just $3,500, thanks largely to scholarships.

What you will witness over the next 6 months is the rest of the story. Domonic Brown is at a pivotal point in his career with the Phillies. In some respects, you can't help but feel sorry for the kid. Charlie Manuel won't want to hear that. He's a baseball man, and baseball is all about paying your dues. You want to play in The Show, you better respect the game, respect the process. Sometimes, it can feel like The Process is trying to break you. And maybe it is. But it is still The Process, and virtually every player who has ever played beneath a third deck has endured it. You look around the Phillies clubhouse and see players like Ryan Howard, who was midway through his 25-year-old season before he finally got a full-time shot. You see Chase Utley, who played in 113 games at Triple A as a 24-year-old. And, of course, you see guys like Manuel, who was 31 years old when he finally gave up on major league baseball and headed over the Pacific to play in Japan.
Critics panned "Redline." The Boston Globe called it "an action flick loaded with cars, chrome, and silicone ? everything you'd expect it to be, and yet so much less: less character development, less believability, and most unforgivably, less escapist entertainment."
The measure attempts to reverse what Rep. Jeff Roorda, D-Barnhart, called an "overly broad interpretation" of the state's Sunshine Law" by the Missouri Supreme Court in 2001.
The board will further consider the issue in work sessions as committees continue planning the transition, including boundary changes. Korach insisted the board look at boundaries on all levels, a process that could go until as late as March. Looking at the issues simultaneously will be necessary to help the closure plan, known as Scenario B, go smoothly, according to Korach.
Hey, Chris: I didn't make a big deal in the paper of Terrelle Pryor saying last week that he'd return for his senior season because I seldom believe players when they talk about their pro futures during the season. They either don't have all the information yet and can't make an informed decision, or they're forced to fudge the truth, because no one in the middle of a season can say that he's gone at the end of the year.
The company is also increasing the size of the area where it stores finished steel products at its Harrison Steel Plant.
Five individuals from Sutter County were arrested Tuesday in connection with a false-employment scam that has drained millions of dollars out of government coffers via sham unemployment and disability claims.

Urged by the Obama administration, states across the country have begun to incorporate "value-added" into teacher evaluations, which have traditionally relied exclusively on the subjective views of administrators. The push has met with fierce opposition from teachers unions and some experts and policymakers, who say the ratings are flawed.

There will be meetings for you to attend so you can learn to avoid falling into the trap of trying to "save" or enable Robert, because in order for him to get better he must experience the consequences of going back to drinking. This is not easy to do with someone you care about, and you will need all of the support you can get.
Obama has proposed a freeze on most domestic agency budgets, though he exempts homeland security and veterans programs. But he's calling for an $18 billion, 3 percent increase for the Pentagon.
High-speed and higher-speed rail also would help revitalize downtowns, stimulate economic development and create jobs. Communities with easy access to passenger rail and a mix of residential and retail uses are desirable places to live and locate businesses.

Several unconventional maki rolls, in fact, are Bocuzzi's creations. A good example is the appetizer dubbed Unagi/Foie Gras/Oshi Sushi ($14). It's a weird coalition that nonetheless delivers a satisfying salty-unctuous blast. Ingredients this good do not come cheap. A decent sampling of Ginko's high-quality maki and nigiri sushi can run $50 to $60 per person. Artfully arranged raw fish tasting menus (or "omakase") start at $60.
A few weeks ago I'd written a column about emotionally disturbed pets - suppose this puppy's crazy?
So good that it’s almost a surprise when Detroit doesn’t win if Verlander is on the mound. It felt that way Friday night in New York, too, when the Yankees beat the Tigers, 5-4.

"I'll admit, we do give rewards for great plays -- including the best hit in the game," Finnegan replied, those rewards being stars on helmets. "But that's not the same as a bounty. We traditionally run the ball, and we try to impose our will, and try to take a physical toll over the course of the game.

Dr. Kathy Alvarez, a Beaverton-based family practice physician, says, "I love to motivate my patients with chronic conditions by educating them on why they should engage in exercise therapy to improve their condition. Not only can it help control pain, but it can help them wean off medications that are usually loaded with side effects. Due to time constraints, however, I leave the remaining program details to skilled PTs I refer them to."
Buckeyes coach Jim Tressel's 7-1 record (an .877 winning percentage) ranks him No. 1 among the 15 men who have coached in the game multiple times from either side, Plain Dealer computer-assisted reporting editor Rich Exner has found.
4. Mel Martinez. If this poll had been taken six months ago, I'm not sure Florida's junior senator would've ranked this high. That's because, six months ago, he was leading the Republican National Committee and taking flak for everything from his immigration stance to accusations that he was ignoring the Sunshine State. The man was a walking target. But then, Martinez stepped down from the RNC post, and things started to calm down. It was a good move. The 61-year-old former county chairman has had a few missteps since he went to Washington and needs to focus on his job if he wants to get re-elected. Our panelists seem to think that's just what he's doing. No matter what, he and Charlie Crist are still the two top Republicans in this very politically important state. And most power-brokers also seem to respect the fact that Martinez stays more involved on the local scene than some who get their paychecks from D.C.
The governor's aides said the administration does not intend to gut renewable energy standards, as critics have suggested he would do, though the details of how co-generation have not been released.

Boehner had hoped the overture could shake-up the stalled talks to resolve the other remaining issues. But the shift has not been embraced by the Republican rank-and-file in the House, who have been reluctant to give up their fight against a proposal that does not include spending cuts and adds to the deficit. And Senate Republicans have been noncommittal.
Despite a couple high-profile earnings misses before the day's session began, the overall success of companies in this earnings season and strong news on the housing industry helped the Standard & Poor's 500 finish off its best three-day run in two months, sending it just short of the 1,400 mark. The Nasdaq and Dow also gained again.
Rams sources told the Post-Dispatch a couple of weeks ago that the Browns ended up offering three first-round picks to trade up from No. 4 to No. 2 _ including both first-round picks this season (Nos. 4 and 22 overall). But it's not clear what else the Browns may or may not have offered.

So, with the advantages that worked in 2008 rapidly dissipating, Romney is having to fall back on the one huge advantage he has over all his challengers: tons of money to buy attack ads. Between the Romney campaign and the “independent” super PAC that backs Romney, Santorum is being outspent in Michigan by a margin of 40 to 1.
Some of the nearly $1 billion that would be generated annually by the increase would be used for projects other than bridge and tunnel maintenance, including redevelopment of the World Trade Center site, which some commuters said violates the traditional principle and function of a toll.

"The truth of the matter is they go to see you more. Look what happened with 'Chicago.' The play ran, ran, ran. It was kind of doing OK, the movie came out and the play is still running," she says. "It's something that everyone gets afraid of but it's something not to be afraid of."
Layups: Joel Przybilla, whom the Bulls pursued for big man insurance, signed with the Blazers. Leon Powe, who played for Thibodeau in Boston, remains a possibility. ... Rose denied two published reports that he made it known to management he'd like to play with Pau Gasol if it could trade Carlos Boozer for the Laker. "That's something I wouldn't say to anyone, that I need someone to come to this team or I'm trying to get rid of someone on this team," Rose said. "It was all false. I'm good with the teammates I have." ... Thibodeau typically would spend the All-Star break working intensively for the Bulls. He doesn't envision the increased workload of serving as Eastern Conference coach as a burden. "TheAll-Star Game is a great event for the league and fans," he said. "It's an honor to be there, but my (work) priority is with the Bulls. And I can manage to do both."

Long home to Mexican groceries and restaurants, Cherokee has a number of galleries, including Aisle 1, Art Dimensions and Fort Gondo; print shops All Along Press and Firecracker Press; and many artist studios.
The absence of the two Williamses means Sundiata Gaines likely will start again at the point guard position, as he did Monday against Miami, and rookie Jordan Williams will make his second NBA start at the center position. If Wallace plays, he would start at small forward and Gerald Green, who started against Miami, would then go back to coming off the bench. If Wallace plays, the Nets will have 10 players in uniform.
And the trouble was bought via a pair of consecutive penalties 2:36 apart midway through the third period of a tie game, the club surviving the initial Brian Boyle offensive zone holding the stick infraction but not the Brad Richards’ hold on John Carlson just inside the Rangers’ line at 12:29.

Until routine child vaccination became widespread in the 1940s, pertussis caused thousands of fatalities each year in the United States. While deaths are uncommon today, they still occur: In recent weeks, infants in New Mexico and Idaho have died from the disease.
Keeping rates ultra-low for a longer period increases the likelihood that the Fed will engage in more bond-buying programs to help the economy, a policy known as quantitative easing, said Anthony Chan, chief economist with JPMorgan Private Wealth Management. Those tend to boost bond prices by increasing the overall demand in the market.
The Ravens will sign kicker/punter and undrafted free agent Justin Tucker, who hit 40-of-48 field goals during his last two seasons at the University of Texas. Nothing against Tucker but I’d still expect them to bring in a little more formidable and veteran competition for Billy Cundiff. The New York Jets signed Josh Brown yesterday to push the inconsistent Nick Folk for the kicking job. I would be surprised if the Ravens didn’t do something similar. Maybe, that means signing Shayne Graham again. Either way, you not only want to push Cundiff, you want to have some insurance if the problems that he had last year persist into the preseason.
So, unless Strickland or Kasich herds older Ohioans into other states, Ohio's Medicaid tab -- which is likely to be the single costliest item in Ohio's budget -- can't drop, no matter who makes what speech.
If hiking isn't your thing, the 32-mile Badlands Scenic Loop drive gives visitors a good lay of the land. With 14 photo-worthy overlooks, the trip took about an hour by car. Had we skipped this, we would have missed one of the strangest natural occurrences in the Badlands. Colorful layers of yellow, orange and pink appear atop rock faces and mounds, creating an alluring color palette against an azure sky. Some of the oldest exposed layers in the park, which appear black, date to the Cretaceous Period, 65 million to 135 million years ago.

Sometimes, the linguistic gymnastics are strangely beautiful, and once in a while, a riff even makes sense. But too often, the lyrical lunacy moves from the novel to the self-indulgent; the experience is akin to being trapped in a day room filled with unmedicated patients. All you want is for Nurse Ratched to show up with her little plastic cups filled with Thorazine tablets.
Villa Creek's interior is more in keeping with the region's roots, mission style in shape and colors, with Oaxacan weavings on the walls.

"I see two areas," Hitchcock said. "First of all, we're over-pursuing and we don't have patience over 60 minutes, so it's cost us a little bit. We're a little bit too (fast) getting into the offense when we don't have the puck, so that's causing us some issues. And ... we've got to be better through the neutral zone with it. We're turning it over too many times, and if we can clean up that, it's going to help us quite a bit.

The 10.6 percent seasonally adjusted figure held steady in September for another month, as if branded on the state's economy. Oregon, with almost 200,000 officially unemployed last month, and many more out of work but uncounted, continues to run a percentage point above the national rate.

We started with a mac 'n' cheese battle, pitting Fresh & Easy's version which included gouda, Swiss, havarti and two other cheeses ($2.99 for 16 ounces) with Raley's To GO 5 Cheese Macaroni & Cheese ($5 for 16 ounces). The verdict came in pretty quickly: Both mac 'n' cheeses were bland and begged for seasoning, but the Raley's version barely edged out Fresh & Easy for its firmer noodle texture.

And of course, it was Game 1 of the great Cabrera to third base experiment. And of course, it didnt go so well. (I heard some people say that the silver lining of the Valverde blown save was that the monkey was off his back and he wouldnt have to discuss it anymore.

And then he did a matador supreme with his Ole! on the hot grounder off the bat of Dustin Pedroia which allowed the Sox inning to continue (and add 10 more pitches to Verlanders total). We knew this would happen. We knew Cabrera would struggle. And we know that it will cost the Tigers at some point. Thats fine. We can deal with it. But can we also set one major ground rule about the whole thing?

The fact that his starting lineup has played only 14 games together is another. The third is even more elementary: Unlike other contenders, his players don't need rest, he said.

"Prague Winter" ranges adroitly from intimately personal choices (whether to send a beloved child into exile when parents cannot leave) to momentous ones (whether to commit troops to a battle from which most are unlikely to return). But Albright's overarching preoccupation is what the late American diplomat George Kennan described as "one of humanity's oldest and most recalcitrant dilemmas" -- the choice between "a limited collaboration with evil, in the interests of its ultimate mitigation" and "an uncompromising, heroic but suicidal resistance to it."
He added: "I think obviously that I would be a better candidate, but the objective fact is the voters didn't think that. And I also think it's very, very important that we be unified."
At the very least, enormous respect must be given to the forces that brought these places into being. Stay well back from blowholes and "toilet bowls."

Hey, Shane: I don't see the Browns making a big play for the former Packers quarterback. It's more likely he'll end up in Miami, where his former offensive coordinator Joe Philbin is now head coach. The Browns will most likely have to trade up to No. 2 to get RG3.

But going against the grain, rejecting the norm, doing things your own way, being independent - aren't these the very foundations of the punk movement?

People seldom figure that fat guys are smart. Or that homely people are innocent. Maybe you saw the story in this paper Thursday about a national study showing that jurors are 22 percent more likely to convict an unattractive defendant than an attractive one - with the same set of facts.

The verdict seemed in some ways a considered, middle-of-the-road conclusion. Second-degree murder was less perhaps than what the prosecution wanted, and more than the manslaughter that the defense had hoped for, although their recommended sentence tips toward the heavier end of the five- to 40-year range of punishment for that crime.

We now definitively know just how much of a liar, cheat and phony John Edwards is.

Campbell, Colleen. Former mayor of San Juan Capistrano, victims' rights advocate and sister of the murdered racer Mickey Thompson. Waited 18 years for Michael Goodwin to be brought to trial for the murders of Mickey and his wife, Trudy. Campbell attended every day of the trial in Pasadena, wearing on her lapel a pair of pins depicting gold angels waving checkered flags. Goodwin was convicted in early 2007 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The verdict is being appealed, so she can't quite close the books on it yet. The key to the conviction, in my opinion, was the surprising emergence years after the murders of a husband and wife who placed Goodwin near the L.A. County crime scene a few days before the murders.

When Hernan Cortes came across the brilliant, relatively colorfast reds of cochineal used to color clothing and skin by native peoples in Mexico, he saw a huge commercial opportunity. At that point, Europe had no colors this vibrant or this lasting. Exclusive trade was set up, and care taken to make sure that prickly pear was not taken off the continent, ensuring Spain's place in the textile competition with England. Of course, eventually it was indeed smuggled out and became the coloring of the British military's famous red coats. It also was used to dye the royal purple robes of Europe. In the late 1800s, though, aniline dyes made from coal tar replaced cochineal as red dyestuff for clothes.

This, Simmons suggests, is the point precisely, that sports exist as part of a bigger world. As far as Grantland, he wants it to reflect that, to see what develops and move on from there. In addition to the quarterly, he's planning some additional enhancements — more pop culture and a podcast studio — but mostly he's intent on letting the project take its own pace. "It's better to be under the radar a bit," he says, although, as he acknowledges, "this is already bigger than I thought."

Mr. Romney, according to his white paper, also feels coordination with Mexico is needed to curtail drug and border problems. He should send the invitation to "coordinate" in fancy calligraphy, and maybe that will work this time. Hopefully he means "lending" the U.S. Special Forces to Mexico for some "light janitorial duties," because best I can tell, that's the only kind of coordination that hasn't been tried on the problem.
