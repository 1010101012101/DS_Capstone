He said he thinks the show will be boring, mostly because there isn't a lot of action in Jersey City. He said the city was a poor choice for the spin-off because it's not "very lively," but is still excited to tune in.
"You know, Mater Dei has a great volleyball program," Harre said. "It seems like they always have our number in rebounding because they jump so quick and get to the ball quicker than we do. This time we did a good job of trying to check them. In years past, we didn't do that.
But in Shanghai, the Shanghai Composite Index shed 1.1% to 2728.48, a day after the People's Bank of China lifted the yield on one-year bills issued in its regular open market operation for a second straight week, a further sign it is likely to raise interest rates soon to combat inflation. Also, concerns over local government debt came to the fore after the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported that a Shanghai-backed city investment company will begin to default on its loan repayments.
It's the third time 36-year-old Kenneth Smith has received that sentence for the 2001 murder of Raul Briseno, who was shot to death when he chased a masked robber from his Burrito Express restaurant.

For someone who's always wishing for more hours in the day, a long weekend in Iceland just before the summer solstice dangled a tantalizing possibility: We could do everything on our ambitious itinerary. I like to think we could have done it all, too, if Inga the desk clerk hadn't dangled even more activities in front of us.
Many point to summer basketball as one of the problems.
"There should never be a situation where that happens," he said. "There are specific standard operating protocols, which they are to follow."
The more visible changes are in the private areas of the house. Upstairs, the close proximity of the master bedroom and bathroom to the front door was an issue. Now, the front door opens by a new entry closet, beyond which lies the loft's home office area. Beyond that lie the master bedroom and bathroom. New glass in the upstairs shower window turns from transparent to an opaque blue with the flip of a switch -- views or privacy, on demand.

In his second stint as Monte Vista's coach, Corey Whelchel has the Mustangs in a position to return to the playoffs. Entering this week, Monte Vista was 14-13 overall and 11-8 against Division I teams, and needs just one more win in its final four matches to qualify for the postseason.
The NFL has said as many as 27 players also could be sanctioned for their role in the scandal, but it is not yet clear when that might happen, creating additional uncertainty for New Orleans and some teams that have signed former Saints defensive regulars as they tried to build their 2012 rosters.

The governor recognizes county fair's grand-champion sow? Or praises the Stars and Stripes on Independence Day? Who, especially in an era of fewer news crews, has the time or any incentive to cover such ho-hum "news"?
Sanchez, without a decent running game or a true down-field threat, completed 56.7 percent of his passes last season for 3,474 yards, 26 touchdowns and 18 interceptions. He was not good enough to elevate a flawed Jets team that finished 8-8 and out of the postseason.
"People aren't so much aware of it, but it's happening in judicial races much more than it ever did before, on the local level and even further up," Kennedy said. "States appoint their judges and elect their judges differently, so it's a harder thing to track — but I think, just as we are seeing ... increased amounts of money in legislative races, now we are getting to see it in the judiciary where it has a much more dangerous effect because those are not supposed to be politicized races."
Press Bistro was impressive, too. A great room with an industrial feel and really good food coming out of the kitchen run by chef-owner David English. The place brought new energy and elegance to Capitol Avenue.
I know families today that don't get a newspaper, so maybe the newspaper will go the way of the deli and the streetcars. But I hope not. So I am not for everything that is called progress. I still wish we had streetcars and delis.

The ultimate success of the project, Khanna and others said, could turn in part on U.S. health care reform and the willingness of health insurers to pay for medical treatment offshore.
order when dining at one of Pi's pizzerias? Usually a Bada Bing salad - I love the sweet-savory contrast of dried cherries and salty gorgonzola crumbles - and a deep-dish pizza of my own creation. It makes me happy to know I can re-create that experience - almost - when the Pi truck rolls near my office. The Bada Bing is often available, and the pizzas are made fresh to order. But to keep the line moving efficiently, you can't pick your own toppings. That's fine, because the veggie-friendly Western Addition is one of my menu faves.

Besides being a real estate tycoon, Mike Harrah is a Hollywood stunt pilot.
Hey, Darrell: Sure, but it comes with the price tag of giving Hillis a qualifying offer for one year at the average of the top 10 salaries at running back. That would be around $8 million, I'm guessing. If no team made Hillis a multi-year offer, the Browns would be stuck with a hefty one-year salary and cap number for a running back with one career 1,000-yard rushing season.
For the first time, patients will have to pay $5 to see a doctor and $3 for prescription drugs. The number of covered doctor's office visits will be capped at seven per year unless deemed medically necessary.

Ward said it became possible to complete the plaza by the 10th anniversary only after the Port Authority redesigned its overall trade center construction plans in 2007.

The fact that he does not, and has not known for months, that he terminated us, that is unprofessional and unethical. A leader should know what is going on, Clausen said.
At this rate (30 2/3 innings in five starts), if he makes 33 starts - which he reached three times as a Giant - he'd get to 202 innings. Halfway to having his option vested. Of course, the Giants could always manipulate his innings count to ensure he's not vested.
But there's also a number of smaller speedy receivers – who play in the slot or on the outside and could also contribute in the return game — available. Baylor's Kendall Wright is considered the top playmaker in that group and could fall to the end of the first round. The Ravens could also pick up a player like Arkansas' Joe Adams as late as the third round, or Florida International's T.Y. Hilton. Neither is expected to become more than a No. 3 receiver — at least early in their careers — but they have the potential to be explosive return men and would give offensive coordinator Cam Cameron more diversity when calling plays.
The fire began Saturday morning in the Fox Pointe Apartments on Southeast Roethe Road in Milwaukie. The mother and infant boy were trapped inside the apartment, and she was forced to toss the child out the window to neighbor Jeff Bryant, 24, who caught the child.

Another Cleveland chef has just stepped into that rare spotlight.
“I think it’s important to remember it and remember the mistakes you made little to learn from it,” he said. “But at the same time, it’s an emotional loss, and you definitely don’t want to dwell on it. All of our goals are still in front of us and everything that we have left to accomplish takes precedence over looking back at a game we maybe could’ve had.”
Not that there's any guarantee.
At the end of this month, Dave Frohnmayer retires from the presidency of the University of Oregon, with a victory lap that could qualify as an Oregon track event.

Chisem was the godfather of Butler's kids and the two played chess and golf together.
Already, the market for first basemen is starting to take shape. The big-wallet New York Yankees have Mark Teixeira, an MVP-caliber first baseman, entrenched at the position. The Sox have coveted Gonzalez for more than a year, and they'll seek to keep him in the fold. The Milwaukee Brewers will be exploring options with Prince Fielder in the near future (and that could mean a trade), and the Cincinnati Reds are expected to approach NL MVP Joey Votto about an extension this winter as well. The Los Angeles Angels and Los Angeles Dodgers figure to be wild cards in the search for 1B as the 2011-2012 market takes shape.

The disciplined can have a fine meal here. Order some cherrystone clams on the half-shell and a Caesar salad followed by the porterhouse for two, or a lamb or veal chop and you'll come away thinking Wolfgang's is a swell restaurant. Stray further into the menu and your meal won't measure up, and at these prices, these days, it very well should. When you're spending close to $100 per person, you should get more for your money.
In a quick 45 minutes you can experience over a hundred years worth of history that was once tucked away in drawers, trunks and attics.

Kahne opened the season with a month of wrecks, mistakes and disappointing results for Hendrick Motorsports, culminating in a collision with Regan Smith that ruined last week's race at Bristol. He's 32nd in the Sprint Cup Series points standings, and his car is down to 34th in owner points, theoretically putting Kahne in position to lose a guaranteed spot in the field if he has another wreck or awful performance today at Auto Club Speedway.
Elway is not a cinch, though. One, don't dismiss the possibility of a Tebowmaniac infiltrating the voting process. Pat Robertson has had a strong following over the years, and he's plenty mad.
But my favorite wine of the day was the Domaine de la Terre Rouge 2008 Amador County Viognier. Here's a varietal that often defines California "fruit bomb," at least among white wines. It's often dense, heavy, viscous, dripping with honeysuckle and juicy with peaches. It can be a fun wine, if tiresome after a few sips, especially when all that richness is braced with more timber than in a Mother Lode gold mine.
“The shift to digital is putting the world’s libraries and newsstands in the palm of every person’s hand, and is the beginning of a journey that will impact how people read, interact with, and enjoy new forms of content,” said Andy Lees, Microsoft president, said in a statement.

The current edition, now called Guinness World Records, devotes two pages to “mythconceptions” — records you thought were records. Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth, but it’s not the world’s tallest mountain: That honor goes to Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Most of its 33,480 feet is underwater. The most prolific writer of James Bond novels was not Ian Fleming but John Gardner, who wrote 14 Bond novels and two screenplay adaptations. And the world’s largest desert is not the Sahara but Antarctica; a desert is an area that has no or very little rainfall.

DFLer Entenza doesn't have a firm list of surgical budget cuts, but rather a menu of possible reductions that come to a field-leading $8.4 billion. That's far more than he'll need because he proposed solving the deficit through an equal mix of cuts, taxes and payment delays.
In addition to the pizza, Hill offers piadines, which are organic salads piled on freshly baked pizza crust. While the Soma ($12.75), topped with a Caesar salad with organic chicken, was a clunker, others made up for it. The Titus ($11) features the same blistered crust washed in the tangy tomato sauce, topped with mixed greens with bright bursts of cherry tomatoes, garlic and oregano; my current favorite, a special called the Huffy ($12.50), is like a BLT with strips of translucent housemade pancetta.
Brooklyn Mayor Richard Balbier said: "If they pull out, that would be a tremendous blow to Brooklyn. It would be like Ford pulling out of Brook Park or Chevy pulling out of Parma."
“Filing charges is the first step to obtain justice for the victims and their families,” said Doug Drummond, Tulsa County's first assistant district attorney, in a statement supplied to The Times. “This is a tragic and senseless crime.

"This ruling affirms the science- and fact- based policy that we have adopted as part of a comprehensive approach to managing black bears in New Jersey," said Commissioner Bob Martin.

This is a public safety issue that requires responsible action by the state."
Trailing by a goal after two periods, the Devils tied the score three minutes into the third when rookie defenseman Adam Larsson, making his playoff debut, beat Ilya Bryzgalov with a wrist shot. David Clarkson scored the go-ahead goal eight minutes later on a rebound of a Zach Parise shot, Travis Zajac made it 3-1 three minutes after that, and Bryce Salvador added an empty-netter.
Giants linebacker Mathias Kiwanuka’s praise of Mara was just as high: “He’s more of a protector of the game than he is of his business assets.” Mara and Kraft speak proudly of the new CBA, for the extended labor peace it provides as well as the long-term television deals that came after. They spoke even more proudly last week of their teams, which will compete for a championship ring.

Competitive judo didn't really exist in the United States until Yoshihiro Uchida invented it six decades ago, bringing the ascetic disciplines and ritual courtesies practiced for nearly a century in the land of his Japanese ancestors to California, where he was born.

EVERY big-name memoir deals with miseries, drugs, drink, lousy parentage, abuse. Comes now Joe Pantoliano’s advance copy with the long title: “Asylum. Hollywood Tales From My Great Depression: Brain Dis-ease, Recovery, and Being My Mother’s Son.” Joey Pants from “The Sopranos” and birth in Hoboken, NJ, says his mom was “fiercely schizophrenic” and that he was dyslexic and the family was dysfunctional, and tells of his undiagnosed mental problems, substance intake, 20 Vicodin a day, clinical depression and mental and physical pain.

Katz received annual raises and bonuses. But by 2007, she still made only 46 percent of what Jacob had earned in 2001, according to the suit. And the suit also says that in 2008, Katz' base salary and target bonus were less than the base salary and target bonuses of every male member of the strategy committee. Katz said she discovered that she and the only other female committee member would be the lowest paid committee members in 2008, and that every male committee member was classified as a "Tier I" officer, when both of the women were classified as "Tier II" officers.

“I think his ability to rebound and finish around the bucket and defend” will stand out, Lipscomb said. “I think it’s going to be a growing process with him. That’s always the case with most freshmen at the college level. That’s why it’s college. It’s a faster game.

Forget the officiating in Game 1. Forget Kidd's obscene shooting performance. Think about how aggressive the Blazers were – um, until they weren't. Portland was cruising, ahead by six points with 5:30 to play, and failed to slam the door.
It is awesome! Meeting those guys and getting them to sign my DVD copy of "Team America: World Police." I thought that movie should have won the Pulitzer Prize.

"We're going to punch the establishment in the mouth," said Cenk Uygur, host of Current's "Young Turks," a new nightly news commentary program. "I would like to declare war on the establishment media like CNN because they have their plastic fake robot anchors on there that do not deliver the news.

A: I'm working to get back into daytime. I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the format, and I felt comfortable in the genre. I didn't particularly enjoy the experience I had last year, if I'm being 100% honest. But I felt good at what I was doing. I'd love to do it again and I've been talking to lots of cool people to make that happen. But in the meantime, I'm having the time of my life playing a recurring character on "Mike and Molly." It's been so fun to play with those people. Melissa McCarthy (who plays Molly) is a comedy queen, and it's just been absolutely fun. It's been a nice reprieve to go back into scripted and primetime, which I have a lot of experience in. I'd love to do something with Leah Remini (who was also not brought back to the second season of "The Talk"). I thought we had tremendous chemistry, and you can't cast that.
He probably will retire long before anybody says he has to retire. But one imagines him joining the rush less often next year, and less often every year after that, until he stops joining it entirely and is just a stay-at-home defenseman, back in his own zone, alone, as much younger, faster players race toward him on a two-on-one.

It is not our habit to feel sorry for $220 billion corporations, but we almost can feel sorry for Wal-Mart executives, at least up until the point that they decided to try to bury the story.

How is $1,000-a-night hotel better than a $500-a-night one? A gorgeous setting and a large room are generally a given. There can be guaranteed ocean views and legions of fawning staff.

Here's a snapshot of three versions -- the Students' Co-op at the University of Minnesota, the Monterey Cohousing development in St. Louis Park and the Red House Community in St. Paul.

"They've both earned the right to play," Hitchcock said. "It's a lot different if you have a go-to guy, or a guy that's on a learning curve. We don't have to protect any of these guys. Both guys have seen ... everything. I'm also smart enough to realize it takes a lot of energy for a goalie to play in a playoff game, and we want to have the right energy going into a playoff game."

The work U.S. Vets and other groups are doing with homeless veterans is important, especially when you look at some eye opening numbers.

Thirty five hundred of those were veterans. And what they found is shocking.

Teacher evaluation policies embedded in HB 153 and Senate Bill 5/Issue 2 feature "value-added" measurement, which currently excludes teachers below the fourth grade and those who teach nontested subjects. It's supposed to measure student growth, but relies solely on state achievement test scores from one year to the next. Notably, statistical research presented at the ETS conference showed that "considerable error rates" in these calculations make value-added measures "unreliable." The report, by Mathematica Policy Research for the Institute of Education Sciences, warned against using this much-touted measure, stating that "more than 90 percent of the variation in student scores is due to variation in factors that are not under control of the teacher."
Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said Gosar may have a slight edge because he is the de facto incumbent.

Anthony carried the Knicks in April with his best basketball since coming to New York. But the Heat wouldn't allow him to get his hands on the ball, as Miami pressured the Knick playmakers and always had a defender fronting Anthony. In the odd times Anthony caught the ball, it was farther out than his usual comfort zone, and there was always another Heat defender running to double-team him as he turned toward the hoop.

Eli Carter (7 pts., 3 reb., 3 TOs): There were a lot of bad shots to choose from Sunday, but the worst and most egregious was the quickly-jacked 3-pointer on a fast-break, down four with 1:50 to go. Jardine's shot was the one that buried Rutgers, but Carter's finished digging the hole.

For one, he would have been 80 (which the sanctuary insists he was), 20 to 40 years older than the typical chimp in captivity (or, as one chimp expert put it, an age that's "hard to swallow"). Second, some Hollywood accounts indicate a chimp named Mr. Jiggs played Cheetah in the early films, and Jiggs died in 1938. Third, in 2008 a similar claim was made about another chimp who played Tarzan's sidekick, a claim that was less than accurate, since that chimp was born in 1960.

Cleveland – that is not the America I know. That is not the America we believe in. A lot has changed since I came here in those final days of the last election, but what hasn't is the choice facing this country. It's still fear versus hope; the past versus the future. It's still a choice between sliding backward and moving forward. That's what this election is about. That's the choice you'll face in November.
Madonna's sophomore movie is missing the titular qualities in her directorial debut: "Filth and Wisdom." At one point, Edward doses some sleepy socialites with pep pills, and they dance to the Sex Pistols' "Pretty Vacant," but except for that rip-off of Sofia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette," Madge is a slow-footed director - and a wrongheaded writer who forgets to make us care about the characters.
Legacy: Jan. 17 -- the same day as the 1994 Northridge earthquake -- is now Fire Protection and Volunteer Day in Japan. In 2002, the Disaster Reduction Museum (www.dri.ne.jp/e/index.html) opened as part of a Kobe memorial to "1.17," also known as the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake. Full-scale dioramas with smashed cars and leveled walls re-create the quake's impact, while another exhibit uses huge images and bone-rattling sound to recall the sudden collapse of buildings and roadways. The Great Earthquake Hall shows films with more inspiring images of recovery and renovation. On the waterfront, part of the damaged Meriken pier has been left untouched, lampposts and walkways permanently askew, to form the Kobe Port Earthquake Memorial Park. It's east of Kobe Maritime Museum, which also has an earthquake exhibit.
"It puts us on a razor’s edge," Lampley said of the fight game’s scheduling irregularities. "When you get a fight that exceeds expectations, like Hagler-Leonard, it can be spectacular. It’s as memorable as any sporting event can be and people are going to talk about it for generations.

The survey of 601 households in St. Louis also found that 23 percent of parents would enroll their children in Clayton schools, adding about 3,600 students to the 2,500-student school district. About 13 percent of respondents said they would choose Kirkwood schools; 12 percent named Lindbergh schools; 11 percent named Rockwood; 11 percent said Ladue; 7 percent picked Brentwood; 11 percent named "other" school districts; and 13 percent weren't sure.
Fall means back to school for kids and young adults. But hundreds of programs in the Southland are open to seniors, too. And relatives who are concerned about keeping their elders healthy —mentally and physically — should encourage them to participate. Research indicates that as long as people stimulate their brains by learning and trying new things, intellectual growth continues, even at an advanced age.
Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, and House Republicans diverge on some legislative issues — notably what to do about Chinese currency manipulation, an issue that has become a centerpiece of the Romney campaign. And that could further highlight the differences within the Republican Party.

Don Scipione, Independent: He pointed to his years of leadership with the former Lyric Opera Cleveland, taking the organization from its beginnings at Cleveland Institute of Music to a home at Cleveland Play House, and its later merger with Cleveland Opera. "I will find a way to replace the cigarette tax with a sustainable source of funding" for arts groups, he said.
The series of storms that battered Sacramento and all of California started on Christmas Eve in 1861 and lasted 45 days. The city's rivers overflowed and swept thousands to their death. A giant inland "lake" — more than 250 miles long and 20 to 60 miles wide — submerged the streets of what is now Old Sacramento for three months. The city quickly had to figure out a way to make itself flood-proof to sustain its economic might.

That isn't the case with preteens and young teens. Kids aren't in a place mentally where they contemplate their financial obligations. I still have to remind my nearly 12-year-old son that he's supposed to deposit part of his allowance in his savings account every month. Like most kids, he has so many other things on his mind -- from school cliques and homework to neighborhood friends and the cartoon he wants to record -- that personal finance holds no real importance at this age.
And “Toy Story 3” proves just how good something can be — if somebody simply cares.
The law delivered by Moses, the argument goes, belongs in the courthouse because, as President Harry Truman declared, "The fundamental basis of this nation's laws was given to Moses on the Mount."

The most abundant type of plutonium, the 239 isotope, has a half-life of 24,000 years and emits alpha rays. If deep inside the body, alphas can cause healthy tissue to turn cancerous. But the rays are so weak that outside the body they can be stopped by skin or tissue paper.
The city recently applied for funding from the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency to resurface Lorain from West 85th to West 150th in 2013, with a streetscape in the Variety Village section of Lorain from West 116th to West 123rd streets. The city has $800,000 in capital funds budgeted for the streetscape, which Ward 17 Councilwoman Dona Brady says will be used to leverage up to $3.2 million in federal funds.

MARLBORO — From the 1950s through the early 1990s, Imperial Oil recycled petroleum products on a 15-acre site in Marlboro with little regard for spills.
After making controversial picks in the first three rounds, the Bears on Saturday selected Temple tight end Evan Rodriguez, a player with a somewhat troubled past. Considering they took a cornerback who will change positions to safety, a wide receiver believed by some to be a discipline problem and a top draft pick who could be too light to play defensive end, it looks a great deal like the Bears aren't afraid to take chances on players they like.
THE SPY NEXT DOOR

Making financiers is something you can accomplish on the spur of the moment. I like to think of them as the logical next step in a novice baker's repertoire - as easy as preparing brownies, but with a slightly more sophisticated result.

Ritter has said that Henry Bright's story started out as a song but it wanted to be more. He's right, there's too much here for a ballad: It expands as it moves forward, complicating relationships, deepening our concern for Bright and blurring the lines between good and bad.
