My mom liked to tell a story about the time she found a pile of dried-up peas I had tossed behind the couch. I must have been about 3 or 4. Over the years I learned to enjoy most of the things I hated back then. Like anything that contains a vegetable other than sweet corn in it. But I never really enjoyed liver or cauliflower.

Straub says the real reason she started the parties was so she could dress as an air hostess. She is fascinated with 1960s jet-age culture: Her apartment, located just a few blocks from the bar, is full of memorabilia -- airline bags, old posters, pictures of flight attendants, even furniture. She has multiple outfits, each with a one- or two-piece suit, hat, scarf, bag and airline pin. And her alias is Flighty Hostess, "because I'm flighty," she says. She says her obsession stems from the love of the era's style and formality.
Despite a lack of affinity for planes, matrices and coefficients that prevented me from ever being an architect, Julia Morgan has been one of my heroes ever since I first beheld Hearst Castle as a tyke. Not only was she the first woman to get a civil engineering degree at U.C. Berkeley and to become a licensed architect in California, she was a social activist in her own quiet way. She put as much of her creative energy into state park structures and YMCAs and other buildings dedicated for use by women as she did creating luxurious private homes (or castles) and public buildings.
"The pressure we're all under is the money," Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the panel's top Democrat, said in an interview. "It's less money than people would like, so you have to figure out how you make those decisions."

øA: I do have confidence. The public has every right to have high expectations for our industry. We shouldn't put oil in the water, and we should run our business safely. We live in the same communities as every other American, and we want to see our resources developed responsibly. We've learned from the Macondo incident and others and have steadily improved our practices as an industry. We're in a much better position as an industry today than we were a few years ago.

The game ended in a 0-0 tie after regulation, sending the contest into two 15-minutes halves of overtime. Had the Timbers been able to keep the game scoreless after the overtime, the game would have been decided by penalty kicks. But Opara's score sent the Earthquakes through to the third and final round of play-in games and sent the Timbers to their first loss at Jeld-Wen Field.
The bank will normally charge a fee for setting up the mortgage—usually between 1% and 2% of the loan. On top of that, expect to pay the notary (notaio) 1% of the total mortgage loan, while the estate agent's fees are usually 3% plus VAT, which currently stands at 20% in Italy.

He is pursuing an identical strategy in his presidential campaign, crossing the country making pledges and promoting the image of a competent public servant focused more on fulfilling his promises with tangible practical results than focusing on questions of ideology. His closest rival, Josefina Vasquez Mota of PAN, has attacked him for what she labels a series of uncompleted pledges as governor but has failed to gain much traction since winning her party's nomination in February

Still, it's early, even when it got late, which sounds like something Yogi Berra would say. For the first time in the four games they have played, the Indians took a lead, which Lewis then wasted. For the second straight game, Travis Hafner homered. What's a rain delay for a man who has waited so long to overcome injuries and to get his power back?

Since the end of World War II, getting a driver's license has been a rite of passage for teens, but that's less and less the case. The share of people in their teens, 20s and 30s with driver's licenses has dropped significantly over the past three decades, not only in the United States, but also in some other wealthy nations with a high proportion of Internet users, transportation researchers have found.

Alexander Willeford, now 32, is facing a first-degree murder charge, among other charges, in the stabbing of his stepfather, Dirk Willeford, 54, in his apartment in the 7700 block of East Osborn Road. The suspect's 79-year-old grandmother initially called police to say her grandson, Alexander, had broken into her Scottsdale home near 82nd Street and Camelback Road and stabbed her and her 81-year-old husband.

Most relevant may be the example of Allegheny County, Pa. When it revamped its government a decade ago, it also asked for volunteers. The outpouring of help, as former County Executive James C. Roddey noted on these pages a few weeks ago, was stunning: More than 500 volunteers, 80 percent of whom had never been involved with government, 54 percent women and 34 percent minorities. Their work product was every bit as impressive: 32 reports containing 800 recommendations, 700 of which have been implemented.

Since buying the team at the tail end of the 2004-05 season, Gilbert has earned the image of an engaged, activist owner. It makes it easier to field a winning team by inheriting LeBron James, of course, but since then, Gilbert has pressed most of the right buttons with the fans. He also has learned to adopt a hands-off policy in other areas.
Banks, Newlin and Lanzone were members of the men's four that finished ninth at the Beijing Games. However, none of the rowers who helped the United States win a bronze medal in 2008 in the eights made the cut.

The show has also connected with viewers beyond the Rose City, DeMontreux says. "Even though this is specific to Portland, there's a little Portland in everybody. People come across characters like this in all walks of life."
OSD, which celebrates 140 years of education this year, holds a haunted house fundraiser in the basement of its boys' dormitory, but the space, which has a dirt floor, needs renovation.

Filled with fuzzy guitars and sleek electronic textures, Garbage's self-titled 1995 debut offered a kind of techno-conscious counterweight to the prevailing post-grunge sound Vig helped engineer as the producer ofNirvana's landmark "Nevermind."

"We've talked with a zillion guys the last couple days. We don't expect to be signing a bunch of guys," Heckert added. "Cap room's not an issue.

"Wow," Strawberry said when asked how he reacted. "It's kind of shocking, but Mo's a little older now and when I played he was still doing the same thing, shagging fly balls, running into walls, but he was younger then. So when you get a little older, you got to be a little cautious about things.
Another case was filed against Kownacki in 2003 by a man identified as John Doe, who as a boy mowed the parish lawn at St. Theresa's Catholic Church and School in Salem, Ill., where Kownacki was pastor from 1979 to 1986. That case was settled in 2009 for $1.2 million. Wisniewski's case also stemmed from the time Kownacki was at St. Theresa's.

Savas also thinks regional transportation goals are too focused on Portland. High-density living and more public transportation make sense for inner Portland, Savas said.

After he put the team through a rigorous practice Tuesday, McMillan gathered his players in a circle and did his best to temper the distractions with a post-practice chat. He acknowledged that there have been -- and will continue to be -- a host of rumors flying around, but he urged his players not to believe everything they hear. McMillan also emphasized that every team explores trades and encouraged players to talk to him directly if they heard anything unsettling.

The Port Authority does not receive tax revenue, making its toll and fare structure the primary way to fund the region’s critical interstate transportation network. At this point, after a multi-year effort to control spending in recognition of declining capital capacity, failure to act risks 240 critical infrastructure projects and thousands of jobs, and will prevent the overhaul of the agency’s aging facilities.

It isn't a real house; it's a training facility set up on the police range on the West Side of Cleveland. Its rooms can be changed just by moving some of the walls that are hung on tracks. "Suspects" hide in closets, under sinks, in window seats, beneath couch cushions, in refrigerators . . . places you'd never think to look. Which, after all, is why they train as intensely as they do.
He said that he would stress his plans to create jobs, balance the budget and cut the price of gasoline. “I think I’m clearly much bolder than Rick Santorum or Romney. I think my ideas are much clearer and much more specific,” he said. “We’re going to go back and do what works.”

The therapist was also on the rescue's board of directors, and helps people find new homes for their animals via Craigslist.

Michael Lloyd/The OregonianMark Weislogel, a mechanical engineering professor, describes Portland State University's new drop tower to physics students from Tualatin High School. The tower, one of three in the nation, is used to create nearly weightless conditions for objects in a 400-pound metal canister that is dropped five stories. High speed video cameras record experiments as they are subjected to zero gravity for about two seconds while the canister falls. "Oh, I hope this works," says Professor Mark Weislogel, as he and visitors watch a silver rectangle box the size of a small refrigerator rise slowly inside a metal-framed tower in the engineering building atrium.

Sariñana has become one of those international singers in Los Angeles. "Mediocre" wasn’t initially available in the United States, but won plenty of American fans anyway, including the decision-makers at Warner Bros. Records.

"Run Right Back" came early and still sounds like a kissing cousin to "Howlin' For You," and "Dead and Gone" followed as one of the best-sounding, best-mixed songs of the night. "Tighten Up" came late and had fans whistling along, and another late-night jam, "Little Black Submarines," recalled "Stairway to Heaven" with its chord progressions but was Black Keys through and through.

First of all, this isn't about big corporations. If it's true that they don't pay any taxes (it isn't, but that's the left's narrative) then there's no reason for big corporations to care about the size or cost of government, which is all this fight is actually about.

Also not surprising, the tone of these tomes has become gloomier as the difficulties of fighting this scourge have become clearer and the prospects of defeating it seemingly bleaker.

My country and its way of life were attacked on Sept. 11, perhaps more terribly than on Dec. 7 — I can't really say because I can only speak to what I witnessed on the former date. Our country went to war after 9/11 just as it did after Dec. 7.

Guard Alexis Chappelle (13.3 ppg, 3.9 assists) is one of the better juniors in the area. Alyssia Winston (9.3 ppg, 7.8 rebounds) has been playing well recently, too. The Hawks fell 56-34 to St. Joseph's in the quarterfinals last season. ... Howell Central has had a rollercoaster-like season due largely to a number of injuries. Sharese Jones (19.8 ppg) is one of the more prolific scorers in the area and an exceptional free-throw shooter. Katy Gerler stepped up in the district championship game with a team-high 13 points in a 37-25 win over Howell North.
I've had people suggest, only half kiddingly, that Cubs fans deserve some kind of protection. I cannot cite any specific cases in which employers have discriminated against a person because he or she is a Cubs fan, but it is easy to imagine such cases.

Such détente seems unworkable. Hamas, for starters, demands the replacement of Abbas’ nonpartisan prime minister, Salam Fayyad — who oversees the Western-equipped internal armed force — with its own man. But if it does, the government would lose virtually all its outside funding, because Fayyad is the only Palestinian the Israelis, Americans and Europeans (who together keep the Palestinian Authority solvent) trust with their money. Even Gulf states that publicly support Hamas won’t fund a government without Fayyad.

KeyBank also overhauled its bill payment service this fall for the first time in 14 years, primarily by reducing the lead time to pay a bill to one or two days in most cases.

This protects the customer from any potential overdraft, said Allison Landers, senior vice president of web and mobile channels for Key.

As a long-time Letterman fan, I still find it hard to give him a pass on this. "I was just kidding," doesn't cut it. And his lame excuse that he was talking about Bristol, who is of age (barely) but wasn't at the game, doesn't pass muster either. It wasn't that he was making a snide remark about the sexual promiscuity of one or the other of the Palin children. He was exhibiting the attitude that, because of Bristol's pregnancy at a young age, the Palin girls are fair game sexually, easy girls, the kind of girls kids snickered about behind the bleachers at school. Except he's too old for behind-the-bleachers mocking. More importantly, that attitude demeans all girls and women in the struggle to own and respect our sexuality and personal integrity.

The proximity to Mount Tam ups the ante all the more. A five-minute walk from Lytton Square on Throckmorton Avenue and you're deep in Old Mill Park, engulfed by redwoods along a creek. A five-minute drive and it's as if you've left civilization behind - except for the shingled homes somehow locked against ridges above a narrow road that can't possibly be two lanes.

Description: This new (2004) pocket playground was the result of months of lobbying by neighborhood children to turn a rundown parking lot into a kid-friendly space, and its name is a testament to their perseverance. Tucked into a sunny little alleyway in the heart of the Mission and enclosed by wrought-iron gates, it features a large fountain surrounded by wooden tables and benches, and arbors festooned with fanciful sculptural flowers. On one side, a brightly painted structure has cargo nets and baby teeter-totters; on the other side, there's a giant spiderweb climbing dome. Both sides have wall-to-wall soft flooring.

If you look at the recession that we went into, we went into it in 2008. Why? Because of a huge spike in energy prices. Now you read on the front page of the paper that energy prices are going up again, and now there's this headwind to the growing economy as we've seen repeatedly as this economy has tried to recover. And yet we have vast resources of resources in this country. And we have a president who is doing everything he can to see the oil and gas, coal in this country as a liability, not an asset. Something that should be kept in the ground to protect you instead of taken out of the ground to enrich you.

The seed for the film was Mr. MacQuitty's vivid memory of seeing the Titanic launch in Belfast when he was a child—its grand departure gave him a yearning for adventure, just as its demise soon afterward left him with a sense of life's frailty. During World War II he made documentaries for the Ministry of Information, but, he recalled, "all the time I was thinking about the Titanic and what a wonderful film this would make." When the opportunity arose to adapt Mr. Lord's book for the screen, Mr. MacQuitty assembled a stellar team, including the novelist and screenwriter Eric Ambler, acclaimed for writing tense thrillers, and the director Roy Ward Baker, who had worked for Mr. Ambler making British Army training films.

The Tribune's editorial writer needs a lesson in how insurance works before endorsing the Ryan budget, a Trojan horse that will end Medicare as we know it. Rep. Paul Ryan's proposal calls for private insurance plans to provide benefits that are similar in cost to those provided by Medicare but less comprehensive. This gives insurers a way to attract the youngest and healthiest seniors, leaving traditional Medicare with older and sicker beneficiaries. This drives up costs in the program, making it unsustainable, advancing the GOP strategy to let Medicare "wither on the vine."

The real questions are in the House. Will the bill be sent to the same committee? Can it find a single Republican vote on that panel?

Over the past four years, our district has been forced to trim $105 million from the operating budget. At Aloha High School, this has meant larger class sizes, fewer academic and social supports for our students, less professional development for our faculty and a decrease of services from our central office.

People are often bad at knowing how to spend their money - I've been at least as bad as everybody else in this regard. Lottery winners, for example, barely benefit from their new fortunes. When we get some extra income, we spend it on privacy, space and refinement. This has some obvious benefits: Let's not forget the nights at the Comfort Inn when we were trying to fall asleep while lacrosse teams partied in the hallways and the rooms next door. But suddenly we look around and we're on the wrong side of the Haimish Line.

Increased security measures, the lack of jobs in the U.S. and an improving economy in Mexico are major contributing factors, experts said.

He’s consistently in the quarterback’s face and may be the best pressure inside linebacker in the draft. Though he’ll likely be drafted late first round, early second round, Hightower comes in with the experience of playing an NFL-ready 3-4 scheme in Alabama coach Nick Saban’s multiple front. He had a knee injury in 2010, but not one significant enough to slow him down for the remainder of his college career. Plus, he has about 20 pounds on most other linebackers at his position but doesn’t lose much in the way of speed, clocking in at 4.65 at the NFL combine.

Gloria Lamar sees signs that the nation's economy has taken a turn for the better. Her 401(k) retirement fund is recovering. Her job is stable. Last June she even felt confident enough to buy a new car — a 2012 Ford Fusion. Nothing fancy, just reliable and good on gas.

But even though Thanksgiving is about optimism -- our national secular religion that the "pie," metaphorically, will keep getting bigger -- I would wager that around the groaning table this year, you'll hear revelers worrying about national decline. Certainly I've heard it a lot lately, from departing Obama administration officials, global leaders and my family and friends. There's a sense that something is torn in the national quilt, and nobody quite knows how to mend it.

"People don't like to play recreational activities they're not very good at," he said. "The golf industry should allow equipment that would make it easier for someone to hit the ball and get it in the air, hit a couple good shots and have a good time without having to take 100 lessons."

The price of gasoline has now reached $3.90 locally, and nationwide the average is $3.71. Missouri has the lowest taxes on gasoline in the country. What does that mean? Price gouging. Come on, attorney general, get after it.
In fairness, Mr. Todd and Ms. vanden Heuvel are right, at least about the spat being manufactured. The Romney campaign smartly pounced on Ms. Rosen's comments as a way to turn the tables on the Obama campaign, which had been banging the war drums on the entirely phony "Republican war on women" ever since the entirely manufactured Sandra Fluke controversy.

Saladino is blocked by Alexei Ramirez, who is signed through 2015, but there’s no second baseman in waiting behind Beckham. It’s possible that Eduardo Escobar could get the first shot to replace Beckham, with Saladino serving as the extra infielder.

To take up Todd Bray's idea of reducing these excessive pay packages, I propose our city adopt an "affordability index" using the median pay of city taxpayers. Currently 55K (Internet source) i.e., no more than 1.8 times median for city manager and so on. Someone better at math than I can construct a workable formula. You get the idea. Our tiny city is paying the city manager more money than the state gives the governor of California! Why is Pacifica paying $50K to starting teachers and $75K to starting police officers? We taxpayers are being used as an ATM for the personal enrichment of resume-building senior administrators and police and fire departments just like the cities of Bell and Vallejo, only on a smaller scale -- so far.

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, bring water and rice to boil; cover and reduce heat to low. Let simmer without stirring for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest 5 minutes. Then, fluff with fork. Calrose rice is naturally sticky and tends to cling together.

Doug Wheeler: I grew up in rural Arizona, and when I was young, I'd have to get up at 4:30 a.m. and "ride" fence line, which was my chore before breakfast. The idea was to check different sections of the fence to repair any spots that were compromised. So at first it's dark and you can barely see, and then gradually the light is coming in. The sky was always everything. If there were a couple of scattered cumulous clouds, I found that the clouds created this sense of space, defining space, making it feel dimensional. You don't see that so much here, where there's so much pollution and clouds are two-dimensional-seeming. But out there there's a real sense of volume, when you look at the vault of the sky. That's what I started playing with as an artist: not looking at things but the tension in between things.

The light rail tracks on Conway Street near Camden Yards are part of the course and have presented an engineering challenge. During the race, they will be covered with a mixture of asphalt and mesh, which organizers hope will hold as the race cars zoom over them. As a result, light rail service will be temporarily divided into two lines, the northern run stopping at Baltimore Street and the southern run stopping at Hamburg Street. Shuttle buses will connect the two. Baseball fans riding light rail to the Orioles-Blue Jays games a few days before the race will be deposited a few blocks farther north or south of Camden Yards than usual. (The Orioles, it seems, are doing their best to minimize the disruption this will cause by rapidly diminishing the degree of fan interest in attending games.)

An Asian accent here, a deep nod to the Mediterranean there, but underneath it all is recognizable food, competently prepared. Flash-fried calamari, bay scallops and shrimp ($9.90) are perfectly tender under their mantle of greaseless batter; a generous rib eye ($22.90) is prepared as ordered and plated with a riot of juicy sauteed sweet onions and roma tomato wedges. One evening's grilled chicken paillards ($16.90) looked as if they might have spent a little time in the window waiting to migrate to the dining room, but the basic ideas were sound, pairing feta, sauteed spinach and olives with a cream sauce kissed just faintly with ouzo.
