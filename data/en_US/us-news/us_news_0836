Take a deep breath, people. I presume the abusive, “murky’’ agency to which the paper refers is the NYPD.
That rusticity seems in marked contrast to the all-inclusive resorts. Indeed, Casa De Campo has the sheen of luxury around it. The property also includes 1,700 villas, some of which are private and some of which can be rented for a few nights.

Nothing aggravates Republicans like seeing nasty, effective tactics upon which they have so long relied being turned against one of their candidates.

If you’re anything like me, your mind doesn’t quit. From the moment I wake up to the moment I lay my head down on my pillow at night, my mind is bombarded with all the things I still have to do, all the things I haven’t done, and all the things I wish I had time for. It’s an endless reel and to be honest, it exhausts me way more than any physical labor could.

This conventional nugget of wisdom, however, is wrapped in layers of intriguingly edgy artifice. Chris Rousseau's scenic design, from a concept by director Rose Riordan, gives the production an eerily abstract look -- white walls criss-crossed by angular lines and pocked with trapezoidal doorways and file drawers. It's like something we might expect to see in one of Imago Theatre's experimental works, and it immediately conveys a sense of displacement and potential claustrophobia fitting for Charlie's unmoored state of mind. Daniel Ordower's lighting veers from stark to shadowy, and Jen Raynak's subtly tension-building sound design is the sort of wonderously effective work we've come to expect from her.

(On the state of the quarterback situation)- "I don't think it's changed much. Colt (McCoy) looks great by the way. We like Colt, we do. I think at any position, well I shouldn't say any position because left tackle is probably not where we would go, but most other positions, if we find somebody that we think is a really good player and is better than that guy than we are going to do it. That's all positions, it's not Colt. We like Colt. We think Colt can play. I know everybody talked about the Washington deal, but it's not like you are saying Colt is a bad quarterback by doing that. We like Colt."

The cast, which includes Richard Chamberlain as Eileen's priest and Michael McGrady as her husband, is likable, and there are some touching and funny moments.

Wyden said he is not suggesting "that the president has no authority to act in this area. If American citizens choose to take up arms against the United States during times of war, there can undoubtedly be some circumstances under which the president has the authority to use lethal force against those Americans.

Police learned that Hagerty had failed a previous polygraph test about the allegations arranged by prominent civil rights attorney Eldon Rosenthal, one of several lawyers Hagerty contacted over the years. (Hagerty also contacted the Portland Tribune, which declined to publish a story in part over credibility concerns, the memo notes.)

But an analysis of the deal indicates it may not be so risky after all. It clearly has big perils for Vision and CarVal, which manages real-estate assets for the closely held grain-marketing company as well as other investors. The region's economy has suffered from the contraction of major employers and other strains from the downturn.

September 11, 2001, was just such a time of crisis. Religious leaders certainly tried to speak out and offer comfort and solace, but it's unclear to me how many of us were able to admit how terribly unsettling this event was, how very much it wounded our psyches and grieved our spirits. I wonder how many pastors were willing to share, honestly and responsibly, their rage and grief and confusion. I don't think we're doing ourselves or our congregations any favors when we confine ourselves to meek platitudes about how everything happens for a reason or hide behind pious conventions about God's mysterious ways. Maybe if more people had seen religious leaders being more transparent, even more vulnerable, it would have helped them to realize they weren't alone.

My opinion: The Obama administration can hardly be blamed for making marginal budget cuts here and there when it is fighting key wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and when the U.S. budget is already strained by domestic needs in the midst of the worst economic depression since the 1930s. And a small cut in Latin America's military aid programs is no big drama.

The 11th (Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge of Warrensville Heights) and 16th (Democratic Rep. John Boccieri of Alliance) may each have lost 5 to 10 percent.

Heading into Thursday night's season finale, one of the few story lines worth monitoring was Luke Babbitt's chase to be the NBA's most accurate three-point shooter.

He is coming off what Taylor called a “career defining win” at the CAAs where he defeated Donald Vinson of Binghamton, who was ranked as high as seventh nationally, in the CAA final in overtime. Vinson had beaten the defending national champion earlier in the season.

A. More than 1,500 “Raines Hotels” were built above saloons, meaning 15,000 rooms that could possibly be used for prostitution or gambling. Some of the rooms were so low that only a midget could stand up straight. I was amazed that the city could turn on a dime to exploit the loophole.

Kosaka characterized Hiroshige as the Norman Rockwell of 19th century Edo. Like Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post illustrations, Hiroshige's work could be found in the homes of many Japanese people. The method of printing from woodblocks meant that many people could have works of art in their homes. The ease of production, combined with the delicate nature of rice paper, explains why the prints, which didn't hold up well, were repurposed as packaging for their fateful trip from Japan to Europe.

This ability to hyper-focus on one stream of sound amid a cacophony of others is what researchers call the "cocktail-party effect." Now, scientists at the University of California in San Francisco have pinpointed where that sound-editing process occurs in the brain—in the auditory cortex just behind the ear, not in areas of higher thought. The auditory cortex boosts some sounds and turns down others so that when the signal reaches the higher brain, "it's as if only one person was speaking alone," says principle investigator Edward Chang.

A site such as BackBid could also have a cleansing effect on the hotel industry, from a customer-service point of view. I receive regular complaints from readers about mandatory "resort fees" and other nuisance surcharges arbitrarily added to the bill.

Damiens is fantastic as Markus, a man who is about as ordinary as they come on the outside. Her friends and coworkers don't understand what she sees in him, and at first, neither do we or Nathalie herself, for that matter.
