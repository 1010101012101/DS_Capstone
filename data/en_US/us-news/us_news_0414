The Better Business Bureau says Caylor's company - Miracle Dry - is a scam. Caylor told me complaining consumers simply regret buying expensive vacuums.

Because class distinction, at least in New York, cuts several ways. It means Duncan can charge an absurd billable hourly rate for mind-numbing Roth Properties contract work while acting in a pro bono capacity trying to forestall a man and his grandmother's impending eviction from public housing, which also happens to be owned by Roth Properties. It means that when a major accident at a Roth building kills three construction workers, showing "how quickly an entire mass of concrete could turn itself into rubble and fling itself to the ground," the legal mess must be cleaned up, and Roth must be declared the winner. And when the young man in question is picked up on a murder charge, it means that loyalty trumps class (and its relative, professional expertise) as Duncan attempts to figure out whether he can be true to his ambition while entertaining the notion he may have some morals after all.

On WR Victor Cruz possibly on "Dancing with the Stars" one day: "Victor looks like he is a pretty good dancer. Funny you should say that, I was kind of buzzing through the TV last night and I saw some of that and I saw Donald Driver, Donald is pretty good. I think Victor would be good on that. Victor is a smart guy. I think Victor wants to focus on football more than anything else right now. He had one good year. One good year don’t make you a great football player. It means you had one good year. And he is a smart young man and I think he wants to focus on what is most important and that is football. I think he is doing the right thing. Maybe at some point later on his career he may be able to do that but right now I think he is focusing on trying to be a good football player."

People live here while holding down jobs (for one man who works the swing shift, his friends make sure to prepare an extra plate and fill a thermos of coffee, which they place on the hood of his car, for when he wakes). Some struggle with extreme medical issues, scraping by on disability checks or Social Security.

Californians also expressed through law the conviction that for most juvenile delinquents, the object of the justice system should be rehabilitation rather than punishment. Not every wayward teen, not every bad seed can be rehabilitated. But our values as a society require us to give them an honest chance at it.

Now, as a result, the Cleveland museum is playing catch-up in a world of impossibly steep art prices for 20th-century art.

It wasn't necessarily a style that would appear to befuddle the Wolverines -- usually height and long athletic bodies gave them trouble this season -- but their inability to get a defensive stop for most of the game made a comeback difficult and, just when they were able to shut down Ohio for the final 4 minutes, they couldn't score themselves.
While we ponder our options, Safdari has his sole kitchen helper bring out samples of bulani to nibble. The tortilla-thin crispy flatbread, folded over a smear of sweet, slow-cooked onions and leeks, gets wolfed down before I can request the cilantro dipping sauce that usually comes with it.

Dealing with fatigue -- always a challenge in a normal 82-game season -- is an even bigger challenge this season, with the condensed, 66-game schedule that includes many back-to-backs (the Blazers have 19) and at least one back-to-back-to-back per team (the Blazers have two, including one that starts Feb. 14). Teams are searching for ways to muster energy on those second and third nights, and also looking to take advantage of opponents when they catch them on tail ends of consecutive-day games.

Pagan was traded on Dec. 6 for Giants reliever Ramon Ramirez and Pagan’s replacement, Andres Torres.

That 2008 hastily organized seder was led by Eric Lesser, now a Harvard Law School student who served stints in the campaign and at the White House as David Axelrod's assistant and at the White House Council of Economic Advisors. The campaign staffers invited then Sen. Obama, used the Maxwell House Haggadah because that's what they could get on short notice and created a tradition that has endured.

There always has been danger in hockey. Mike Bossy’s career was cut in half because of a chronic bad back caused by the countless malicious cross-checks he took from defensemen trying to move him out from scoring areas around the net, the same brutal cross-checks that were somehow legal back in the day that forced Tim Kerr out of the slot and into premature retirement.

WHAT HAPPENED: After a masterful seven-inning return by Doug Fister, the Tigers took a 2-0 lead to the bottom of the ninth. With Jose Valverde getting the night off, Octavio Dotel came in to try for his first Tigers save. He didn't get an out. He walked the first two hitters he faced and wild-pitched them to second and third. One run scored on a passed ball by catcher Alex Avila and the tying run came on Jesus Montero's double off the centerfield fence. Left-hander Duane Below took over and, after a sacrifice sent Montero to third, he gave up a fly ball to right from John Jaso. Montero beat Ryan Raburn's strong throw to the plate for the winning run.

The problem was first detected in the 1996 Burgundy vintage, when collectors, experts and journalists started to notice the prevalence of a number of faulty bottles that weren't just infected with cork taint. It became apparent that this was a wider issue and pretty soon there were noticeable faults with the 1995 vintage, too.

The disaster highlights the intense risks that come with working in one of the country's deadliest industries. Alaska waters are home to the nation's richest fishing grounds, where boats haul in billions of pounds of salmon, pollock, crab and other seafood each year.

You've said that Jerry Cornelius (who makes a very brief appearance in the new anthology) is "as much a technique as a character" -- what does that mean? Do you regard him less as a fully dimensional character than as a cipher?
Many of the album sides were every bit as good as the famous radio singles. The brothers Popoff – the singer A. Jay and guitarist Jeremy – have always been open about their admiration for Cheap Trick, and much of their recorded output can be seen as an extension of their heroes’ fusion of Beatlesque melody, metal guitar, and heavy irony.
But to gain the protection, U.S. institutions hosting foreign artworks need to apply for a certificate from a State Department office that administers the immunity act.
For example in November, employers hired 4.15 million people, while almost 4 million people either quit or were laid off from their jobs. The difference is similar to November's net gain of 100,000 jobs.

"From a public relations standpoint, there is a lot of new construction on Fort Meade that the typical resident in this area can't see, and people on Fort Meade can't talk about their jobs," Menser said.
Actually, the more I think about it, the more I’m glad my little girl wants to be the temporary bride of Frankenstein at the end of the month. It’s safe. It’s play. It gives us a good excuse to expand our conversation.

What does feel original is its setting — Harlem, where Price, who grew up in a housing project in the Bronx, has lived since 2008, and which plays itself. It's a good and welcome setting, a changing scene and mixed economy that allows for a range of stories and themes, with humans of different stripes living in close quarters. It's a part of the city rarely seen on television, and one in which, for a change, white people do not dominate the frame.
Rottermond Jewelers, which has stores in Milford and Brighton, has seen an uptick in sales compared with a year or two ago, said Dean Rottermond, the company's founder and one of its owners.

Most Thai restaurants in the Bay Area bend to America's sweet palate, so ultimately the dishes lack the balance characteristic of the cuisine. Not so with Tom Silargorn's food. His larb moo can clear sinuses; the green papaya salad can blister the tongue. The menu is too long, so knowing what to order helps (go with House Specials or Original Thai-Style Specials). His first restaurant is in the Tenderloin; he opened the modern space in Hayes Valley last year. It's pretty, with rock walls, tile floor, wood tables and clear plastic chairs; however, it can be painfully noisy. The Tenderloin location is quieter and more casual, and the food is just as good.

"No one knows how big it was when it arrived in San Jose," Grimes said of that fish that came through the South Bay Aqueduct. "But it's extraordinary that any fish can survive the trek through 1.8 miles of tunnel, 10.8 miles of canals and 31.8 miles of pipeline."

And if the homeowner has a second loan or mortgage insurance, any modification of the first mortgage - including principal reduction - that reduces the risk of foreclosure benefits the mortgage insurance company or second-lien holder. Should taxpayers subsidize them?
Manhattan-based rapper Juelz Santana has often been the jester in the Dipset court, whistling, yipping like a chihuahua, and rhyming about Viagra. He had plenty of off-color jokes for the crowd on Sunday, and his swaggering set was also the most abrasive of the evening. The incorrigibly hostile Maino made a cameo appearance and performed a verse of the taunting “Hi Hater”; Santana seemed overjoyed to sing along. (Incidentally, kids, “she don’t know we’re going back to the crib” is a downright creepy thing to say about your date.) The Dipset emcee made the most of his hometown advantage, shouting out to New York City no less than 25 times during his set; no word about Jersey, which was where you were on Sunday, Mr. Santana. Never did he pump the crowd up more than he did when he invited Lloyd Banks onstage to perform the smash “Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley."
But Seau did not feel immediately embraced by his teammates. He experienced an attitude shift in the seventh game of his rookie season when he successfully called a defensive huddle. His team was not victorious on that day, but, in a way, Seau was.

It has long been clear that there were more than enough votes in the Senate to kill the waiver program. (Unless some of you senators have been lying.)

Rep. Chris Kelly, D-Columbia, said making the Medicaid technology grant a casualty of the impasse is "incredibly shortsighted, both on the part of the Republican majority and the governor. They're allowing political bickering to cost us $50 million - actually $100 million over two years."

THE PRESIDENT: We don't go looking for a fight. But when we see our homeland violated, when we see our fellow citizens killed, then we understand what we have to do. And because of the sacrifices now of a decade, and a new Greatest Generation, not only were we able to blunt the Taliban momentum, not only were we able to drive al Qaeda out of Afghanistan, but slowly and systematically we have been able to decimate the ranks of al Qaeda, and a year ago we were able to finally bring Osama bin Laden to justice.

-- And I've noted a few cases where foreign lines say that discounts such as those for children are based on the phony base fare, not the surcharge. Presumably, then, on that $520 Paris fare, instead of paying the normal 10 percent ($52) an infant would instead actually pay $430 (10 percent of $100 plus the full surcharge).
Noble said about 80 percent of hearing loss goes untreated because people aren't seeking help. Sometimes it's because the hearing loss is still in the mild stage, but sometimes it's because people aren't comfortable with acknowledging there's a problem.

Perhaps it was the sugar rush, but as the boy begged for another round, I found myself itching to know a little more about the history of maple sugaring in Quebec, so I headed back downtown to Canadian Maple Delights in the Old Port neighborhood. Downstairs from all the pastries and other maple products (maple caviar, anyone?), the free museum has a décor with a tree motif. Amid historical examples of taps, pails and other equipment, the display tells how Native Americans were the first to discover "sinzibuckwud," the Algonquin word meaning "drawn from wood," using their tomahawks to cut into the tree, reeds to run the sap into birch buckets and hot stones to concentrate it. A far cry from modern production, in which tubing takes sap from thousands of trees right to storage tanks and reverse osmosis systems shorten the time it takes for the sap to evaporate into syrup.
Saturday's victory could also help win support for the decathlon in L.A.; the Los Angeles Unified School District has threatened to pull funding for the program to help deal with a budget shortfall.

We all have products in our kitchen that we've been using forever.

It was approved via an accelerated process in 2008 for metastatic breast cancer after early positive results in such patients indicated it seemed to halt tumor growth. But as patients were tracked for longer periods of time, it became clear that they weren't living any longer. Additional studies confirmed the lack of any survival edge and revealed far more about the side effects. The drug seems to worsen some side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs given with it and also increased risk of severe high blood pressure, bleeding complications, heart attack and heart failure.

"We didn't imagine the scale of the disaster that would occur when the risks crystallized," King said in the speech.

This brings us back to the head-of-household privilege. No matter how free the country, we're all subject to certain restrictions.

And, essentially, it just required him to be more persistent throughout the game. Lawson could not let the Lakers take him out of what he wanted to do. He had to be more aggressive, a familiar issue for the unselfish Lawson, who has gone back-and-forth in a balancing attack of finding his own shot while still getting other players involved all season long.
For years, banks bet on risky investments with their own money. But when those bets go bad and banks fail, taxpayers may have to bail them out. That happened during the 2008 financial crisis.

Castagna was our 2010 Restaurant of the Year for good reason. Chef Matthew Lightner's magical Whole Earth cuisine occupies the astral plane above anything conceived in Portland. Relying on a rainbow palette of often-unfamiliar plants and meats from nearby hills, forests, fields and waters, Lightner's platings are unfailingly dramatic.

The skin of a sunchoke may be baked, fried and paired with yogurt, or the entire tuber used to make an ice cream, but the results, crunchy and creamy, respectively, equally spotlight the earthy sweet-nuttiness of the sunchoke. And so it goes, course after course, season upon season -- a perennial pleasure to behold.

Matthew Hulsizer. Given the involvement of Blues chairman Dave Checketts as a potential partner of Hulsizer's in the sale, I feared the fix would be in. And that Stillman would be freezed out. But that isn't the case. And now it's up to Stillman and his team of local heavy hitters to get it done. He's been waiting. He's supposedly ready. It would be embarrassing for Stillman to fumble away this opportunity. Having strong local ownership would be a plus for the Blues.

Emala's short time in Chapel Hill, to be sure, has had its share of what-am-I-doing moments. Making an alley dodge one practice, the junior found out shooting on the run was a lot harder than his midfield partners made it look.

For Goldman Sachs, which is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings Tuesday, the stakes in the case couldn't be higher. The worst-case scenario would be if it were to lose its license to do business. While that may seem far-fetched, it could actually happen if the company lost a jury trial and any subsequent appeals. More realistically, experts said, the company is likely to settle the case.

It's amazing how the opponents of measures 3-394 and 3-395 have made the proponents out to be evil and wanting to destroy the city. Well, it's our city, too, and all we want is what's best. The best thing for Gladstone citizens is a vote on large projects. The latest is we are anti-education for wanting a vote, and if the library doesn't get built now, our children will be uneducated.

Hair (mine). Clearly the reason I was hired in the first place. It's literally stopped women in their tracks. I'd call it chestnut, and it's starting to show some grey. I had some No. 7 (European scale) light-brown highlights added for a T.V. appearance that never happened. But I let the color grow out for fear of looking like a tri-colored beagle or something. I try to get it cut once a month, by either Carlos Gallegos ($20, including tip) or Barbara Venezia (free). A little Aramis hair-thicking gel in the morning and I'm good to go. I find blow driers really do damage, so I won't have one in my dressing room. I'm not messing around with the "franchise."
Winemakers as a group are crazy, and many succumb to the urge to produce a late-harvest wine. So they are made all over the world, including California.

Unfortunately, the reality of the thing has proved to be something else entirely. For proof, see the message boards of pretty much any paper. Or just wade in the nearest cesspool. The experiences are equivalent. Far from validating some high-minded ideal of public debate, message boards -- particularly those inadequately policed by their newspapers and/or dealing with highly emotional matters -- have become havens for a level of crudity, bigotry, meanness and plain nastiness that shocks the tattered remnants of our propriety.
Cherundolo, who grew up in San Diego, is just excited to be back. And relieved. He played through pain for months after colliding with a Hannover teammate during training last fall.

You know, maybe older, veteran players that can come in and help us fill a role for a year or two."
Q: My sister's 8-year-old son is beginning to notice some of his friends telling their parents to stop embarrassing them. Now, my nephew is doing the same but for silly things, like when she gives him a kiss on the cheek before he gets out of the car for school in the mornings. Because I am his aunt and pretty close to him, I asked what it was that she was doing that upset him, and he really did not come up with anything. Her feelings are hurt, mainly because she is a hard-working single mom with two jobs and cherishes their time together when they do get to hang out. I was wondering if he might just be repeating what some of his friends are saying, but really appreciates these things. How could we get to the root of the problem without asking him a million questions and clouding the situation even more?
