What Nobuo understatedly called "hot and cold eggs" doesn't begin to do this thrilling duo justice. The cold egg featured a chicken eggshell filled with chicken-infused chawanmushi (egg custard), ornamented with salmon roe and osetra caviar, plus some gold-leaf flakes to subliminally reinforce the opulence.

Thus, one can argue that it is in OPEC's interest to keep the price of gasoline below $5 a gallon. The technology is available, increased demand for the technology would make it more accessible. One would expect OPEC to act accordingly.

Stavans coins the term "Menardismo" to describe the "spongelike quality" of post-Modernista Latin American poetry, its capacity for assimilating and reshaping other cultures so as to make them "acquire a new authenticity." His reference is to the short story "Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote" by Argentine Jorge Luis Borges, who is represented here by a half-dozen poems, including "The Cyclical Night," a lovely rumination about mankind's infinite capacity for star-struck gazing at the timeless cosmos.

A familiar theme used by those opposed to opening new areas for oil extraction is that it won't do anything to address our immediate needs. The most frequently cited duration for new locations to result in tank-ready gas is five to 10 years. Couple that with President Barack Obama's assertion that we are producing more gas now than ever before. It leads one to do some basic math and realize the approvals must have been initiated whilePresident George W. Bush was in office.

A sense of alienation permeates the north, which is the poorest part of Nigeria.

WASHINGTON -- If you've wondered why it's so hard to subdue budget deficits, you should consult a new study from the Congressional Budget Office called "Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options" (free at www.cbo.gov). You'll learn from its 240 pages that the deficits definitely can be curbed. The CBO presents 105 policies (it doesn't endorse them) that would shrink deficits by trillions of dollars over the next decade. You'll also learn -- surprise! -- that most choices are political poison.

If you've paid attention to the too-good-for-just-Mediafire freebies ("Dreams Money Can Buy," "Trust Issues") and DJ Khaled's summer anthem "I'm On One," you know two things: A) Drake is killing anything he touches right now and B) His maudlin, faded songs are so insular, so disconnected from the four-on-the-floor clubs that you wonder if he ever leaves the studio or just chooses to get bent comfortably. And that's why "Headlines," produced by Noah "40" Shebib and Boi-1da, is a real surprise. The usual dank and cold beats are replaced with a buoyant, staccato synth line and Casio snares. The song just goes, without a soft-to-loud dynamic or even obvious entry and exit points for its verses and hooks.

He's playing poorly, so he must be dogging it.
I thought the days of finding a great cup of hot cocoa had vanished. You know, the kind that uses real milk as opposed to an envelope of powder. It was a pleasant surprise when I stopped at Noosa Bistro in Mentor and requested something warm with a twist. Their response: a Noosa Cocoa ($5.50), an old-fashioned hot chocolate that comes in a glass mug with whipped cream swirled on top and a dusting of cocoa. The twist is that the hot cocoa is laced with vanilla vodka and Amaretto di Sarona. Genius. The nuttiness from the amaretto and the sweet vanilla prepared me well for the bitter cold that awaited me outside. -- Greg Burnett

Unfortunately after the games, you're very passionate, things happen, you don't expect to injure yourself or anything like that. But you just got to deal with it."

The assumption, it seems, by the Sun, Gov.Martin O'Malleyand now Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz is that local teacher pension costs should be paid at the local level. It seems to me that the Governor is trying to unload costs from his already bloated 35+ billion dollar budget, and he is using the pension cost move to do that, and proposes that somehow, in the Sun staff's opinion, an "elegant solution," would be to raise taxes in a way that would increase the "piggy back" payment back to the counties. Voila, the pension cost increases at the county level are paid for.

The tool should be available at dealerships next year, eliminating the need for the GM team to visit in the case of a crash.

Glen Ivy has two hot mineral water wells. Every day they refill a giant bath of red clay, trucked in from Temescal Canyon, with fresh mineral water. The clay turns the water a terra cotta color. My friend and I waded in, grabbed handfuls of mud from a giant slab on a pedestal in the center of the bath, and lathered up. A word of advice here: wear an old bathing suit, because the mud can stain.

• Close Call: Thunder Tops Blazers -- Kevin Pelton, Basketball Prospectus: Nonetheless, that single call illustrates the razor-thin margin between winning and losing an individual game. It's indicative of why statistical analysts believe that point differential is a more meaningful indicator of team strength than wins and losses, which are subject to more of the whims of chance. As it turns out, Portland and Oklahoma City are perfect contrasts when it comes to this argument. With the win, the 19-5 Thunder improved its advantage in the Western Conference to three games. The Blazers, meanwhile, sit 5.5 games back at 14-11. ESPN's current standings show Portland out of the playoff picture as the last team among four with identical records tied for sixth place. Yet the Blazers' point differential (+6.1 points per game) is not only better than Oklahoma City's (+4.8), but tops in the entire conference.

As walnut prices surged for the 2010 crop, Diamond paid growers much less than most buyers, according to several growers interviewed by The Wall Street Journal. And yet on September 2, Diamond made an extra "momentum" payment to growers they hadn't received in past years. The payment sizes varied, but averaged 25 cents a pound or more, growers say.

The science fair just sucked. It was the most-difficult episode, because I got dough, and I'm not a baker. Already so many times on the show, I was getting desserts and things I'm not necessarily good at. The fact that I had to do dough was challenging, and then the pans didn't get as hot as we wanted them to, so I couldn't fry things, and we didn't have ovens.
The worst assault in our history brought out the best of New York as we rose on uncertain legs like a gutsy fighter beating the 10-count.

øAs long as your child's income doesn't exceed the amount you spent on support, and meets the other tests, you can claim the child as a dependent, says Terry Durkin, an enrolled agent in Burlington, Mass. For example, suppose your daughter graduated from college in May, found a job in September and earned $20,000. As long as the amount you spent on her support exceeded $20,000, you can claim her as a dependent, Durkin says. However, if you claim your child as a dependent, she can't claim a personal exemption on her own tax return.

That's why this case is unique and unprecedented — because this isn't just some anonymous strength and conditioning coach who is being accused of contributing to a player's death.

I once played an impromptu jam session in the food/bar car of an Amtrak train that was traveling from Boston to Cleveland. It was in the middle of the night, somewhere before we got to Rochester. It was myself, a drummer playing spoons on the bar top, a guitar playing/singing, self-proclaimed "professional street musician," and another player or two. We were having a ball -- until the head engineer came in and shut us down. We started up again after the crew swapped out in Rochester.

Moore looks like he should be on the equipment squad carrying the players' shoulder pads and helmets. He's listed at 6 feet, and when you're listed as 6 feet, you're probably a nudge shorter. His arm is accurate, though not strong. According to the Mel Kiper School of Physical Football Metrics, Moore's arms are probably too short to be considered draft worthy.
