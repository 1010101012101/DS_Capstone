In a remembrance published in The Times days later, Flea described Mullen as "an intellectual, a musician, a writer, a partier and a regular dude." He also represented a punk-rock community that first inspired and then embraced the Chili Peppers as they carried forward the ethos of that Hollywood underground as a multiplatinum rock band. "I really looked up to X and the Weirdos and the Germs," Flea, 48, says today of that scene. "They were mythological heroes to me. I felt like it was a great duty and responsibility for me to hold up that end of the bargain, to be a good L.A. band."

øAs the name suggests, this new HD collection offers upgraded (and now widescreen) visuals to take advantage of the better hardware that powers the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

It's often said that World War II defined a generation of Americans. Yet even as this "Greatest Generation" vanishes - in the United States, one veteran of this conflict dies every two minutes - this war has been handed down to their descendants as a cultural heirloom. World War II still inspires popular books (today, Laura Hillenbrand's "Unbroken," about an Olympic athlete's ordeal in a Japanese POW camp, marks its 74th week on The New York Times best seller list), movies ("The King's Speech" won four Oscars including Best Picture in 2011) and TV series (HBO's "The Pacific" won eight Emmys in 2010, more than any other program).

On his six solo sets, Walker has often looked backward fondly. “The Rise and Fall of Butch Walker and the Let’s-Go-Out-Tonites” (2006) was practically a tribute to the excesses of the glam-rock era — tales of Los Angeles after dark narrated by a participant-observer trying to maintain his enthusiasm in spite of his exhaustion. “I Liked it Better When You Had No Heart,” released last year, was a lovelorn turn toward Americana; Walker even began singing like Tom Petty. It’s hard to exaggerate how catchy these songs are, or how effortlessly he seems to distill what was best about prior pop eras. His raspy singing voice is an acquired taste, but it’s a fine instrument for his narratives, many of which are not exactly meant to be pretty.

In support of its conclusion that Oregon's legislation was ineffective, Cascade cites nearby states that had similar reductions in meth-lab incidents but don't have a prescription requirement, including Washington and California. This is misleading in two key ways. First, the federal data used by Cascade are notoriously unreliable. Some states, such as Washington, don't fully report. For example, based on federal data, the pharmaceutical industry likes to say Washington had only 39 meth-lab incidents in 2009, but Washington actually had 186 that year. As to California, it's not the number of meth labs, but the size. Central California is, tragically, home to some of the "superlabs" of the drug cartels, all fueled by the diversion of retail pseudoephedrine. California produces more meth than the next top five states combined.

Concern about total avoidance of dairy products, unless necessary, is justified. They are the chief sources of calcium and vitamin D. They have a good amount of potassium, phosphorus, protein, vitamins A and B-12 and riboflavin, another B vitamin. People who are taking in too little dairy need supplements of calcium and vitamin D. Or they can drink LACTAID milk, milk treated with the enzyme. Or they can buy the lactase enzyme in pill or tablet form and take those preparations before eating dairy products. Or they can go off their diet and see what happens.

Battery and battery cables. If your vehicle's battery is nearing the end of its functional life, be aware that a string of hot days can hasten its demise. So if the battery's warranty is getting close to its expiration date, have it tested. Better yet, just go ahead and replace it as a cheap form of insurance. Also check the battery cables for dirt, corrosion and cracks. As the California Department of Consumer Affairs notes, it's easier (and cheaper) to have an aging battery replaced at a service station than a dead one serviced by the side of the road.

The governor could have used his popularity and expended some political capital by doubling down on his first-year’s successes in cutting the bloated health-care and education budgets, by pressuring out-of-control local governments to further rein in their often-confiscatory property taxes, and by green-lighting the greatest potential source of private- sector jobs out there, drilling for natural gas using the controversial technique of hydrofracking.

Over my four visits I picked out a few dishes on a whim, including the whole trout ($15.95), which sported an excellent fry, flavored with fish sauce and served with a mango sauce. However, others weren't quite as satisfying, including butterflied raw shrimp ($9.95) with raw garlic, lemongrass and spicy lime sauce; the seafood was chewy and didn't have the velvety texture I'd expected. And as much as I like the pad Thai, I can't say the same for some other noodle dishes, which tasted muddled and bland.
øThe crowd, which had booed throughout much of the second half of the fight for a lack of action from Rios (30-0-1, 22 KOs), seemed stunned by the decision. Rios jumped on the ropes to celebrate, but his body language after the fight indicated that he had lost the fight.

Medjugorje for me was just a time of returning to the Catholic Church and returning to my commitment to Christ. I guess the No. 1 thing Medjugorje did was to illuminate that all my injuries and sicknesses and the fall from running success were again a part of God's plan. I think my running had become so important to me that God at some point just said, "You know what? You're getting too far out there. You're forgetting about me." And I look at my running now just like the heart attack. My running going poorly was a blessing. Because I was just becoming this guy who believed in himself and his running and had no time for God.

"For a long time, it felt like ebooks were worse than paperback books. I think we're now getting to the point where people are seeing some of the advantages," Bridle says.

The franchise's demise grew out of Frank McCourt's protracted divorce with Jamie McCourt and the couple's dispute over the ownership of the team.

That said, I believe the animosity building between Christina Aguilera and Adam Levine is genuine. Team Adam's last man standing, Tony Lucca, a former fellow "The All New Mickey Mouse Club" Mouseketeer to Christina, Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, has become an audience favorite, partially because Team Adam keeps figuring out how to stick it to Xtina. When Ms Aguilera told Lucca he was one-dimensional, Lucca responded with an ironic cover of Britney Spears' "...Baby One More Time" that got everyone on his side. The ill feelings seemed to return last week when Christina advised Adam to pick Katrina Parker over you-know-who.

Those costs are weighing on the industry, which is in the midst of a precarious recovery that started last year.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Assuming we find that this is not jurisdictional, what is the parade of horribles that you see occurring if we call this a mandatory claim processing rule? What kinds of cases do you imagine that courts will reach?
A: Yeah, but now I'm anxious to just get a camera and shoot, beat up some actors. I started working on this ("The Descendants") in July '09. I've been working on this film full-time for two years. We, meaning my producing partners and I, acquired the book when it was in galleys about four years ago. I was still busy writing that aforementioned script with Jim, so I didn't commit to it for a while. My producing partners and the studio hired a different set of writers just to start to get it up on its feet, maybe lure in a different director. Another director was involved for a while. All of that fell through and then I just said, "OK, I'll do it," two years ago. And I wanted to write it alone, without Jim this time, to find my own personal way into it. Somehow I needed to feel it because it's not my story, it's not my world.

Ordering steak in a crepe place -- what was I thinking? I was thinking I would really put Le Petit Triangle Cafe to the test. Here is this sliver of space on the near West Side of Cleveland, long known for those wafer-thin, Frenchified pancakes folded around all kinds of melted delights. Since I was there last, they added full-menu offerings such as Garlic Roasted Pork Shoulder, cassoulet and Steak au Roquefort. The amount of steak that arrived -- I'd guess 4 or 5 ounces -- might not please the biggest appetites, but for medium-size desires, it satisfied tremendously and proved once again that there are little places worth discovering again and again. Tender, full-flavored beef, ripe Roquefort melting on top, a scoop of garlic mashed potatoes and a small handful of tender-crisp green beans made ooh la la on the taste buds from beginning to end. Ditto for the pork dish, which was fork-tender and elevated by a crush of fresh thyme and other herbs. We tried the cassoulet in the appetizer version at lunch, and it was nice enough, appropriately meaty and beany tasting, but begged for a brighter edge. It didn't matter. Our Nicoise salad with salmon brought more coos over perfect poached fish, and the expertly balanced and silky vinaigrette lit up every item on the plate. Chicken-salad fans should depart immediately from the norm and try the croissant-sandwich version spiked with mango chutney and chevre. Even the little side of couscous and lentil salade let each ingredient shine. We missed the entire breakfast menu of omelets and French toasts, but went flying through the crepes. At dinner, the ratatouille version sang with tomato and parmesan notes, but the artichoke ($8) seemed thin on Gruyere cheese. On the sweeter side, the bananas Foster hit all the right notes, but the dark chocolate (with our choice of strawberries, sliced almonds and whipped cream) seemed divinely created rather than made.

No, it sure didn't. Thomas hesitated and passed to Jamal Crawford with about 15 seconds left. Crawford tried to create his own shot, but he slipped, momentarily lost control of the ball, then was forced to try a difficult, baseline fadeaway to beat the shot clock.

Already this morning, fueled by too many black and bitter cups o' Joe, you've swung by the Southern Pacific Railroad Depot in Glendale. Scene of the crime in the seminal noir thriller "Double Indemnity," you picture a hunch-shouldered, stubble-jawed Fred MacMurray skulking around the tanned Mission Revival structure, not stopping to admire the twisted columns or handcrafted ironwork.
Malboeuf, who arrived in Portland in the early 1890s to work for Southern Pacific Railroad, tapped a fellow newcomer, architect Joseph Jacobberger, to design his new home at the edge of town in Willamette Heights.

Damon: “Well, absolutely, I mean, that’s what Cleveland has offered me and I need to go out there and show people I can still play there. Right now Shelley Duncan is the starting left fielder. I know they are going to rotate me in and give him a breather but, you know, I also understand this game, too. If Shelley Duncan is on fire at the plate he’s going to play and if I am they are going to find a place for me. So I’m going to go there and re-join a few former teammates – Shelley Duncan, Derek Lowe, Casey Kotchman – and go and try to have as much fun as we can and try to win some ballgames.”
If it is approved, the governor and legislative leaders should convene a group, including private-sector representatives, to draw up a plan to put to the voters.

2. Pace yourself. Give yourself at least two days to do the con. "I've got to be in another city on Saturday night for another taping of ‘The Nerdist' and I'm really bummed about it. One day isn't really enough time to do a con. You need at least two days," he says.

But McCarty said questions surrounding the case, and the negative publicity cast upon the city since the killing, were largely the result of mishandling of the investigation.

In 1998, Carney was sued by the family of Krista Vignali, who began taking the powerful acne drug Accutane while she was a 19-year-old college student. At issue was whether Vignali's acne was serious enough to justify Carney's prescribed treatment of the drug and whether he did enough to emphasize potentially dangerous side effects. Patients using Accutane are supposed to avoid getting pregnant because the drug can cause birth defects. Vignali became pregnant about the time she started the drug and later gave birth to a baby with birth defects.
