“If you want to know what happened to Liz and the Brazilian guy, I’ll tell you, but you’re going to have to learn about the entire history of marriage in Western civilization,” she jokes about “Committed.” “And you’ll get your gossip, you’ll find out what happened to them, but in the meantime you’re going to have to have a bran muffin that goes along with that, because there’s a lot of nutritious information in there that I’m going to make sure that you get.”

At a previous work session on Feb. 8, the board allocated about $60,000 from surplus to reduce the tax levy from what it would otherwise be, and cut line items, including textbooks and out-of-district training, for expected savings of about $104,000, Superintendent Emil Suarez said.

Bourbon: I have one house bourbon that's superior in quality, and doesn't break the bank. Evan Williams Black Label ($8, 750ml) is pretty big and gutsy, has a nice peppery entry, and some dark fruit comes through on the palate. In a Manhattan it makes its presence known, and it also fares real well neat or on the rocks.
Meanwhile, the Ledesmas haven't accepted a single reservation since that first phone call five months ago. They have been further frustrated by a letter they received from the county on Nov. 1, ordering them to shut down by Nov. 15. They say it came out of the blue.

"There's always distractions,'' Van Gundy said. "On every team, there's distractions. That's just the way it goes. I know it's tough on our players. They're a week away from the trade deadline. I know it's on all their minds, but you still have to go out and play basketball.''
Yawn. We've seen this premise everywhere from "Risky Business" to "Superbad," but what makes "Project X" stand out is that it goes big by super-sizing the chaos with plenty of low-brow laughs along the way.
In that way, maybe Fellows, competing despite a groin strain, was the key person.
"First time Schmidt saw the Pinnacles he knew it was the place. Three columns of rock shot up like the tentacles of some ancient creature, weathered feelers probing the sky." By the time the crazed war veteran runs a few tests with an earth meter and a divining rod, he has no doubt that the power is there, running along an ancient fault line. The rock is a natural antenna. In time, as Schmidt surveys that range, he will be rewarded by a vision that approaches one lonely night at astonishing speed: "It was disk-shaped, featureless but for a ring of iridescent lights round the rim, like gem stones or feline eyes. ... It was, he thought, the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen." In short order, this ex-pilot and wife-beater digs a bunker under the rock and transforms himself into "the Guide," the contact for an extraterrestrial power, a spiritual leader with an army of Lightworkers selling his wacky recordings and luring ever more members to his mission. They call themselves the Ashtar Galactic Command.
Few humans have taught us this better than Oprah.
In addition to working toward meeting the federal benchmarks, Botana is leading an effort to get every student learning English into a support class this spring.

Colleen Hernandez, who is chief executive of the Homeownership Preservation Foundation, a Twin Cities-based national foreclosure prevention center, said that declines in foreclosure rates aren't always a sign that homeowners are in better financial shape. She said that recent legal settlements that impose fines on lenders who improperly process foreclosures are causing some lenders to either delay the filing, or to go the short-sale route.

The discipline is so new that "some people would say it hasn't started yet," jokes Randolph M. Nesse, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan, and one of its pioneers.

The studio is responsible, however, for advertising and releasing the movies from all of its brands and partners, meaning Ross' successor would be an easy target for blame if those pictures didn't work.

Carney, whom Ross hired in 2010 and dismissed early this year.
Richardville said he and his colleagues mobilized after receiving a letter -- signed by a bipartisan group of real estate heavyweights including Robert Taubman, Andrew Farbman, Dennis Gershenson and Gary Torgow -- warning that the state's commercial real estate market would suffer if potential investors believed their personal assets were at risk whenever one of their real estate projects went belly-up.

Martin Feldstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan, has written: "Cutting tax expenditures is really the best way to reduce government spending." These are deductions, credits and exclusions that litter the tax code and benefit people who itemize on their tax forms. Once in the tax code, these tax expenditures automatically continue without annual congressional review or approval  i.e., they become entitlements.

At turns dreary, thrilling, unsettling and even funny, "The Book of Eli" is akin to an existential western. There's a lot of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name and Shintaro Katsu's Zatoichi -- not to mention David Carradine's Kwai Chang Caine -- in Denzel Washington's determined walker Eli.
"Dr. Mambo is one of the biggest witnesses against my client who concluded there was a homicide.

I put out a bowl of toasted Marcona almonds, some marinated olives and a few simple salumi (see Quick appetizers).

Adalind-and-her-false eyelashes, Captain-Not-What-He-Seems Renard, and Hank: It's a relief to see that I'm not the only one who remembers that Clarklewis dinner between Adalind (Claire Coffee) the blonde hexenbiest with false eyelashes that just won't quit, and Hank (Russell Hornbsy). At long last, that particular plot thread is picked up, right at the start. Captain Renard (Sasha Roiz) and Adalind are admiring a painting in what appears to be an utterly deserted Portland Art Museum. Renard casually mentions "we" owned the painting, "in the 17th century," but lost it, along with a lot of heads, during the revolution. Would that have been the French Revolution? Oh, and by the way, he asks his hexenbiest henchwoman, what's up with your cozying up to Hank? He's not biting, says Adalind, who wonders why this is all necessary.

5. Chris Mann -- Opera Mann chose "Because We Believe" to sing and three out of four judges chose Opera Mann because he sang opera, for crying out loud! (Take note, future candidates of "The Voice": If you don't sing in English, Blake Shelton will not pick you) And because everyone loves a sad pre-performance interview, some of you at home will be rooting for Mann not because he sings like Pavarotti but because his mom has pancreatic cancer --"the same cancer that killed Steve Jobs," Mann wants us to know. He clearly moved Cee Lo Green, who appeared miffed when after waxing effusive in his praise, Mann went with Christina because, as she put it, "I know what to do with real vocalists."

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program replaced the old Food Stamps program some years ago. Supporters said people felt demeaned when they used food stamps to fight their family's hunger. (Incidentally, the government now refers to "hunger" as "food insecurity." To me, that's like calling a garbage collector a 'sanitation engineer.")

However, Master Gunnery Sgt. Mark Oliva, a spokesman at Camp Pendleton, Calif., said the investigation found that the SS symbol was meant to identify the Marines as 'scout snipers,' not Nazis.

The super-flexible traveler -- you know, the one who doesn't make reservations till the day he or she needs them -- also gets rewarded. In the olden days, you'd walk into a hotel late in the day and ask if there were rooms the desk would like to give you at a big discount. Although colleagues told me it worked for them, it never worked for me, perhaps as a result of ineptness or the appearance of unscrupulousness.

Lawmakers spent much of the 2011 session trying to build consensus on a major overhaul of the tax code, but were unable to negotiate a deal in the closing hours of the session. The effort faced difficulties, in part because it was based on a plan created by a super committee of business leaders and academics the General Assembly formed the year before. Also, the 2011 effort was launched before Gov. Nathan Deal was elected, giving him little reason to buy into the effort. That will change this year. The governor this week will unveil his own plans for tax reform and Republican leaders are sure to have their own ideas, ranging from eliminating the sales tax manufacturers pay on energy to raising the state sales tax to adding sales tax to groceries.

This is a terrific New World choice. The color, tinged with yellow and lime, has great clarity and viscosity. The aroma is complex with some classic California tropical fruit, some smoke and toast and a touch of minerality. The taste is rich with fruit, oak, toast and butter. This is a very well made and balanced California Chardonnay. The fruit acid gives it life and structure. 93 points.
He then signaled he would soon reassess his own effort. "Over the next few days we're going to look realistically at where we're at," said Gingrich, whose campaign faces $4.3 million in debt and pressure from Republican leaders to quit.

Several staff members confronted Wu for the final time on Oct. 30. Wu’s psychiatrist was brought into that meeting as well, joining the group at the Portland campaign headquarters by speaker phone.

Armed with extra choices in Round Two, the Rams declined to play it safe. Rather than seek solid if less spectacular prospects, Snead and Fisher tried to parlay the picks by gambling for a bigger payoff.
Paradiso has done well with his philosophy. He coached Sousa for three years at Lake Nona and watched him mature into what became a legitimate potential Division I-A quarterback. He also guided the way for former Crystal River quarterback Shay Newcomer, whom he had for two seasons and Newcomer threw for 3,000-plus yards and ran for another 1,000-plus in 2007. Newcomer ended up at Elon (N.C.) University, where he was a roster junior last year but did not play.

The company shocked the investment world when it revealed how much it had spent on things like marketing and hiring. On Oct. 7, in its fourth amendment, Groupon disclosed that it had spent half its net revenue -- $345.1 million -- on marketing costs alone during the first half of this year. Analysts think of those costs as how much Groupon is paying to acquire subscribers. In one of its filings, Groupon said that it would slash those costs significantly due in part to the fact that it had already achieved maximum "subscriber saturation" in various markets.

Severe revenue shortfalls since 2009 have forced a lot of harmful cuts to municipal services, but few have been riskier — or more damaging to the city government's cardinal mission of protecting its residents — than the trims to the Fire Department, whose budget has been cut by 16%. Acknowledging the painful reality of L.A.'s revenue shortfall and the need for shared sacrifice, we endorsed the most recent of those cuts last year, when the city saved $53 million by eliminating fire trucks and ambulances from about one-fourth of L.A.'s 106 fire stations. But we did so based on assurances from fire officials that the cuts wouldn't affect response times. Now we're not so sure.

Furthermore, targeting the actual submitters might be equally difficult. Fetman explains, "While the individual in the picture owns the copyright to the photo or video, from a practical perspective, once it is published, there are significant problems with proof when targeting the individual violator. You must be able to prove that it was in fact that person you sent the photo to who published the image and downloaded it to the website. Of course, the alleged violator will claim innocence and state that they did not post the photo or someone accessed their computer or account. By that time, the embarrassing image(s) is out there and your lawsuit will highlight your photos even more."

It's a familiar scenario: The historic house tour is winding down. You want to stay longer, but you find yourself being adroitly shepherded in the direction of the gift shop. Instead of seeking consolation at the postcard rack, why not make arrangements to spend the night? At the Louis Penfield house, near Cleveland, you can do just that. Built in 1955, the house was recently restored and is today one of the most desirable holiday rentals in the region. The first floor is one open space, comprising the kitchen and living area.

But the very best way to improve your son's asthma control is to help him make his own wake-up messages that he programs into his cell phone. (Encourage kids 15 and younger to program their iPod; cell phones aren't great for the developing brain.) Your son can record the reminders, mix in music, set the alarm to deliver them and presto change-o!, you've got a kid who's tuned in to his own asthma control. When kids control the timing and content of their own reminders, they feel independent — and that lets you relax. The ADEPT study that looked at the benefits of using technology to increase teens' use of their asthma medicine found peer support and musical cues increase adherence to the asthma control routine from 40 percent to 70 percent — not perfect, but a whole lot better.

In 2002, the Legislature approved a method for providing more aggressive treatment for mentally ill people, passing a bill named for Laura Wilcox, a college sophomore shot to death by a man under the care of the Nevada County Department of Behavioral Health.

A. Well, I go to an English private school where there’s just so many arrogant people that I would have fit in perfectly if I had been like that! You do get a lot of people who want to have a go at you, though, just because you’re Harry Potter. ... People say it’s jealousy, but I think it’s spite, really. There’s this feeling in the tabloid magazines that it’s just open season on celebrities and that’s permeated (everything).

"She's a figure a lot of people think they understand," Riseborough said. "And what was tantalizing to me was the chance to correct that."

Among the prescription devices, there's some evidence that the most expensive options are also the most effective. In a 2008 Belgian study, 35 patients with mild sleep apnea tried a custom-fitted appliance and a boil-and-bite device for four months each. Twenty-one were able to successfully control their snoring and apnea with the custom device, but only 11 had such luck with the boil-and-bite model. Nineteen out of 23 patients who stuck with each appliance for the full four months said they preferred the custom appliance.
"It was a lot chippier than the last time. There were a lot more penalties," Granite City coach Scott Topal said. "But, we started off a lot better. The last game, we started slow and had to build up momentum. This time, it was them coming back with the momentum, but luckily we were able to stay one step ahead of them."
The region is generally "extremely difficult to get access" to but political turmoil is "making investment more complex and politically risky" and therefore expensive, said Peter Hutton, London-based analyst at Canadian-owned broker RBC Capital Markets LLC.

In Portuguese, it means "House of Cheese Bread," and the Ferry Street location is the lone New Jersey outpost of a 400-outlet fast-food chain based in Brazil. The big, puffy cheesy rolls are delicious — I’d buy a dozen and warm them up in the hotel room microwave afterward or the next morning. Good sandwiches here; I’d recommend the salada mista, with grilled chicken and steak, lettuce, tomato, green olive and hearts of palm.

Physically, he’s one of the most imposing receivers in this draft class. Questions arose when he had a down junior season, but how much of that can be attributed to the team’s starting quarterback being dismissed in the middle of the season? He broke the school’s all-time record for receiving yards in just three years and he’s been a consistent down-the-field playmaker. One thing that stuck out to us, too, is something mentioned during one of Jeffery’s games — better than anyone, he catches balls away from his body.
"The rule of thumb is to use the best equipment you can afford," Harper says. "A video camera offers a much richer end product, but if you can only afford to use a tape recorder or to take notes, then do that." Or, she adds, try an inexpensive video recorder such as the Flip.
Mike Jensen, Philadelphia Inquirer: "So how long will this shotgun marriage between traditional Big East basketball members and a far-flung collection of football schools hold? And speaking of shotgun weddings, how long will Temple and Villanova even stay in the same basketball league? The ink isn't wet yet on Temple's entrance papers to the Big East for football this fall and the rest of the sports in 2013, but let's cut to the chase: Is there a tipping point when Big East hoop schools such as Georgetown, Providence, and St. John's go their own way? Would that point be Louisville leaving? Louisville and Cincinnati? Louisville and Cincinnati plus Connecticut?"
"They are almost exclusively Vietnam veterans," he said. "These fellows are professional hobos. They are not coming in. The number of hoops they would have to go through to get off the streets, it makes me tired to think about it. I am not certain what to do with this group."
But first we stopped by Thorncrown Chapel, built by renowned Arkansas architect Fay Jones. Architect Safdie has called Jones an inspiration, and no work better demonstrates Jones' reverence for the region's natural beauty than Thorncrown Chapel.

That Paterno's departure is similar but in ways much more sinister than those of other coaching icons, including Woody Hayes at Ohio State for slugging a Clemson player during a bowl game and Indiana basketball legend Bob Knight for assaulting a student on the Bloomington campus, shows only that he is capable of a lapse of judgment, according to Johnson.

Councilor Goddard raised the question of councilor payments. Wilsonville councilors are not paid but, like the mayor, are eligible for the city's health insurance. Last June, city councilors stopped taking cash payments they received for nearly two decades in lieu of the insurance.

Mr. city manager, department heads, fire and police, you want to do something for this city to show you care? Stop horsing around and get to the point you all are avoiding. You know a scaled wage reduction of one percent for every $10,000 earned is the only way forward. Your salaries are not recession proof and the draining you've done of our city's reserves to fund your lifestyles over the last four years has been outrageous. How cowardly of you all to let our city unravel when as public employees the solution is right under your noses, in your publicly funded wallets.

One of the many things to admire about Philip Kerr's long-running Bernie Gunther series is the way the novels seamlessly blend the complex antihero's personal history with that of Germany before, during and after World War II. From the first novel, "March Violets," which finds Bernie as a private investigator in 1936, to last year's "If the Dead Rise Not," in which he's living in 1954 Cuba and working for gangster Meyer Lansky, the series has always given compelling point-in-time glimpses of Bernie's motley career.
Additives to gas do not change a thing except the price we pay in California. The cost is 50 cents to $1 over the national average. Well, at least we saved the so-called Red-legged frog. The FBI does have a list and it includes KKK, Muslem terrorists and left-wing radicals.
Financial markets are markedly different from this time last year. Friday marks the one-year anniversary of the "Flash Crash." Stocks tumbled that day when one large trade overwhelmed the market's computer servers and sent prices into a tailspin. Though stock prices made up most of their losses that day, the sudden drop fueled skepticism that stocks were a safe investment. That led many investors to pull money out of the stock market.

Help wanted: Even after the Senate confirmed three judges this week, 100 of the 857 seats on federal district and appellate benches are vacant. That's almost twice as many vacancies as when the president took office in 2009. Senate Republicans get some of the blame for stalling even noncontroversial nominees -- a tactic that may become less prevalent, thanks to deal between Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Majority Leader Harry Reid. But Obama has submitted only 47 nominees for the vacant seats, a much slower pace than either Clinton or George W. Bush at this stage in their presidencies. The result: judges are juggling heavier caseloads and the wheels of justices are grinding more slowly.
The survey also provided an opportunity for free form comments and 12 were provided. “I was gratified to see that the majority of comments were very positive and give appropriate recognition to Ben Samara and Tamica Trotman for the fine work they do,” said James Norgalis, Health Officer. “We also value the opportunities for improvement that were brought to our attention,” he said, “and look forward to responding to the restaurant community’s needs.”
