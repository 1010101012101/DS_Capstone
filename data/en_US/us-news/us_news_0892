One veteran observer of changes in the San Francisco festival's administration told me that "Graham probably won't be able to do all the things he's come up with. But at least he has ideas." As I departed from the party, heading for another, one of the young people waiting in line was admitted in.

Experts disagree. Some say Hollande emphasized his differences with Sarkozy for political reasons, but will pursue a similar path of budget cuts once he takes power.

The investment group said Cigna relies too much on "adjusted income from operations," which exceeded its targeted performance because customers didn't seek medical services, not because of an executive's performance. The downward trend in utilization — a drop the use of medical services, which is an industrywide phenomenon — is because people "cannot afford to go to the doctor," the investment group said.

After retirement Dick traveled with his wife to many countries and took up the game of golf. He was active in the Bethany Presbyterian Church and served on many committees and also as Elder on the church session. He was always looking for ways to help others and known for his hospitality and friendliness to all who came to know him. Dick enjoyed attending his grandchildren's school events even if it meant sitting out in the inclement weather to watch a game when he was age 90. He was also an avid follower of Oregon State University athletics.

Author Marc Lewis sets up "Memoirs of an Addicted Brain" thus: Sure, I was an insecure and disaffected teenager in the 1960s; I made some terrible and dangerous decisions when it came to drugs, but I turned it around, so much that I became a neuroscientist and, because of this, can explain why my brain loved drugs, and, perhaps, why yours did, too.

Contrast this with the depiction in "The Passage of Power" of Johnson's 1963 Christmas vacation on his hill-country ranch. These days were scrutinized at close range by the press—or so we thought. Mr. Caro plays the long con masterfully, unspooling one sunny anecdote after another of the new president winning over the establishment media with his family's Southern hospitality and lavish barbecues under the stars. Just as our hearts start swelling, however, Mr. Caro lifts the curtain to reveal Johnson working the phone backstage, threatening the editors of two Texas newspapers with economic misfortune if one didn't quash an investigation into KTBC and the other muzzle a reporter Johnson particularly disliked.
"There's a different sense of … I want to say pride," Oshie said. "And I don't have very much playoff experience, but it seems like every hit matters.

But because Christians have a realistic and non-utopian view of human nature, they should be especially alive to the ambiguities and ambivalences of politics. The philosopher Jean Bethke Elshtain captured this well in reflecting on Augustine's writings. "If Augustine is a thorn in the side of those who would cure the universe once and for all," she wrote, "he similarly torments critics who disdain any project of human community, or justice, or possibility."
Today, Sofia's sisters and family live in constant fear because Casanova is still a fugitive and has threatened them in both Mexico and Chicago.

But it doesn't explain the emotional disconnections in the production or in the script, which Mr. Stanton wrote with Mark Andrews, a Pixar stalwart, and Michael Chabon, whose novel, "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay," just about defined the glories of American comic strips. Not only is there a lack of chemistry between John Carter and his Martian princess, but between Carter and Woola, the lumpy, unfunny creature who eagerly follows him wherever he goes; this in a movie directed by the man who created exquisite love scenes between a life-detector robot and a garbage compactor. Nor does it address—to move away from Mr. Stanton, the field marshal of a small army—the deficits of production design and computer imagery, or explain why the score by the usually brilliant Michael Giacchino should be so undistinguished, to put it mildly.
"It's all being done with a design that's consistent with preservation standards," Woolery said. "It'll still have that charming Old Town look and feel."
"There's no sanctuary," agreed David Jackson, head of school at San Francisco Day School. "You're in your home, you sign on to talk to your friends and there it is. Any time, any place. For a 12-year-old that can be overpowering. You get the sense that you really are powerless."
Lakers center Andrew Bynum controled the floor for much of the game and tied the NBA playoff record with 10 blocks (equalling the mark set by Hakeem Olajuwon of Houston in 1990 against the Lakers and Utah's Mark Eaton vs. Houston in 1985). To complete the triple-double, Bynum finished with 10 points and 13 rebounds against the Nuggets.
William went with Santorum. "I think he's a little bit more conservative, but you can't ever tell what a guy's going to do when he gets in there," he said. Elizabeth voted for Romney, but she was at a loss to explain why. "I think she picked him because she thinks he's going to win and she wanted to get it over with," William offered.

"Chances are that she would not stay in the House, she would resign," said James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University.

Arbitron divides the year into 13 four-week ratings periods, one for each month plus a year-end holiday segment. Previously, KFI finished first in August and September 2009, and again in October and November 2011.

"It just kind of came out when we were writing," Jones said. "I think Brian is very drawn to darkness in music and I am drawn to melancholy — not necessarily darkness as much as he is. I think when we just kind of put that together, this is what came out. I'd definitely just gone through a breakup and I felt like I was coming out really well on the other side. ... A lot of it's personal, dramatized and tweaked, and both of us were talking about, 'Oh, what if this?! What if that?!'"

"Hollande makes an awful lot of sense when he talks about the need for less austere, less restrictive fiscal policies, but his credibility is much undermined when he talks about reversing the increases in the retirement age or increasing the minimal wage by a huge amount," said Simon Tilford, senior economist at the Center for European Reform in London.

Beckman, who goes by Bo, said he'd been unable to get satisfactory answers about the investment program's finances, despite his hiring of attorneys, accountants and computer forensics experts over an 18-month period that began in early 2008.

Suits are selling better with unexpected customers, from DJs to hoteliers, notes Jennings, but they're not necessarily wearing them every day. It might be a suit one or two days a week, a sportcoat another and dressed-up denim the other days at the office, he says. "Men just have more options. It used to be that you were a suit guy or a business casual guy in khakis and a polo, or jeans and a T-shirt. Those days are over."
Damon Runyon, no less, mythologized Titanic Thompson as the gambler Sky Masterson in the stories that formed "Guys and Dolls." Cook gives us the real deal, or as close as we're ever likely to get.
5. Free spirits: Admission to Obon festivals is free, but bring a few small bills even if you're not planning to take a refreshment break from the food booths. You'll want to feed a dollar or two to the shisaa (Okinawan lion dog) for good luck when it dances through the crowd, similar to the dragons in Chinese New Year parades. And if you really want to join in honoring the spirits of the deceased, keep an eye out for bon festivals that include toro nagashi, the floating lantern ceremony. Obon means "festival of lanterns," so all the temples will be brightly lit with hanging paper lamps. But at the end of certain bon dances, such as Haleiwa Jodo Mission's in June, or in the Memorial Day ceremony at Ala Moana Beach Park, the festivities conclude with little paper lanterns sent out to sea, to guide the ancestors back to the spirit world.
Now, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration. I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders, enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows. I know that debate will be difficult and take time. But tonight, let’s agree to make that effort. And let’s stop expelling talented, responsible young people who can staff our research labs, start new businesses, and further enrich this nation.

"But there is a musical language that all musicians speak," he says. "You learn to converse in that first rehearsal. There are occasions when it does not work, and you have to salvage something for the audience to enjoy. It can be horrible, but it can be exciting to have a disagreement. Smooth agreement doesn't always make for exciting music-making."

8. Heat things up. For a whole new dimension of flavors, toss sandwiches on the grill. Just brush the outside slices with a bit of olive oil or melted butter, and watch as the grate creates perfect char marks. Once the weather turns cold, you can get a similar effect using a stove-top grill pan. Or dust off that old George Forman grill: It won't work as well as a panini press, but grilling sandwiches is the one thing it does a decent job on. If you want to give cold sandwiches some additional crunch, try toasting the bread.

The Swiss bank account is likely to be a recurring theme of the campaign, with the "just what you'd expect" jab being a likely tag line in many an attack ad.

Obama announced the moratorium last week as part of the administration's response to the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, which triggered the massive oil spill that is gushing millions of gallons in the Gulf.
It is hard to ascribe lofty motives to his duplicity. Tressel thought last season that the Buckeyes were going back to the BCS Championship Game, the "little hump" over which Pryor promised to get him.

I am usually loath to raise this issue in print, because to do so is to incur the whiny phone calls of investors defending their preferential tax treatment, usually on the grounds that without it, they would be reluctant to buy stock in companies that provide marginal people such as myself with jobs.
The Fairfax neighborhood development corporation is a part owner of the building.
It acquired two other rigging firms, Bolger Parker Co. and The Grover Vogt Rigging Co., both of which helped increase George Young’s business, adding everything from dairy equipment, to smokestacks, to laundry equipment, to machine tools.

He yielded the mound to the bullpen in the seventh after walking Aramis Ramirez despite having the third baseman down 0-2 in the count.

When times were good, college presidents added on student centers, libraries and other buildings, apparently without thinking much about the long-term maintenance of this growing empire. Now, when austerity rules the day, they need the state's help to maintain it. That was poor planning.
I agree that we should try to assess the disciplinary content knowledge that students acquire, not just the reasoning and writing skills that the CLA measures. But I would question the assumption that passing a course in science or engineering — or in any discipline — necessarily reflects student learning. Hansen's examples (heart transplants and machines) reflect the collective achievements of a discipline, not what students in a given class have achieved. That will depend on the course itself: what it demands, how it is taught and what the students actually do to earn (or not) their grade. And we won't know until we devise measures of content knowledge in each discipline.

Putin has handed out tens of billions of dollars worth of promises. Frankly, it is not quite clear how he will be getting out of it. Maybe he really has that money. After all, in the entire 12 years that he is in power, oil has rarely fallen below $100 per barrel.... Compared to $10 to $20 per barrel in my time. I don't even want to speculate what might happen if oil falls to $20 now.

"Vaudevillian melodrama is a genre we like to think we created," says Cole Schneider Huling, artistic manager for the company.

There's a lot of audience interaction, a lot of chances to boo the villains and cheer the heroes."

Like its predecessor, it feels more juvenile than, say, the 1959 version of “Journey to the Center of the Earth,” but back then I was more juvenile too, so it may be just me. Its virtues rest mainly in the casting. The kids are indeed all right, and the always-welcome Caine gets points by now just for being Caine.

How does the city pay its bills? Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich reported that $1.7 million of city receipts - 55 percent - falls under the category of "other." Mr. Schweich's office would not say what "other" entails. But given the city's notorious speed traps, a good guess would be that traffic fines are a big part of "other."
The matter under consideration -- the nomination of the first openly gay man to serve on the federal bench -- would at one time have been a flash point in the culture wars. But Paul Oetken was confirmed without a word of objection on the Senate floor and with hardly a mention in the commentariat.

FACT. Many yellow mustards contain turmeric, a spice that activates the genes that help clear out brain-cell waste.

But he said education kept calling him back. In 1997, he took the job of general counsel for Edison Schools, which had been founded five years earlier with the guiding principle that a private, for-profit company could better educate students — and do it more cheaply — than public schools.

In my private practice I see many children with handwriting problems and fine motor delays. In many cases they are holding their pencil incorrectly or have created their own motor patterns to form letters which makes writing laborious and creates a struggle to get their ideas down on paper. Occupational therapists look at how someone picks up a pencil or a fork, for example, and studies the basic anatomy and physiology involved. Often children have pain or discomfort in their hand because of their improper grip, so it's important to first evaluate and remediate because it allow more complex visual motor skills to emerge. In order to foster a child's fine motor development, I've created a fine motor skills development kit and co-wrote the Fine Motor And Communication Together (F.A.C.T.) Kit filled with materials and activities to strengthen their fine motor and communication skills. I give these materials to parents and train teachers so that they can work at home or in the classroom with their pre-kindergarten and kindergarten age children.

That's why the major business groups like the Chamber of Commerce and Washington Board of Trade are certain to come out in favor of the proposed $800 million boost in transportation spending, the majority of which would be made possible by the gas tax increase.

There was a reason that the Rockies didn't give Chacin a long-term contract last winter. They were concerned about how he finished last season. The free fall began when he experienced forearm tightness in Chicago on June 27. Until that point he was bucking for an all-star berth, owning an 8-4 record with a 2.71 ERA. Spring training brought biceps tendinitis and a finger blister, both of which were used to rationalize his lack of fastball velocity.

There was embarrassment aplenty during LBJ's tenure as vice president, not only from the impotence of the position, but from the disdain of Robert Kennedy, the nasty alter ego of his brother.

Excerpt: Stopping the sales becomes more important as the cost of tickets rises. Any improper benefit received by an athlete -- and that includes most everything above tuition, room and board -- worth $100 or more renders him ineligible and forces him to go through the NCAA's formal reinstatement process.

We ask you to show him the same mercy he showed Rusty and punish him in the only appropriate manner – LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE.

2. Teresa Jacobs, Orange County mayor (Last year: 2nd). She almost topped the list. In fact, this was the closest race for the top spot we've ever seen. Jacobs, 54, is viewed as fearless, determined and careful with the public's money. If there's a reason she's not No. 1, it's because her vision remains unclear.

I suffered through one slimy oyster sliding down my throat on the Atlantic seashore. We were on our honeymoon, and Hubby asked me to try it, no doubt for its supposedly aphrodisiac properties.

Mike Lupica, New York Daily News: "The committee doesn't want too much of this real March Madness stuff, doesn't ever want to end up with two Cinderellas in the Final Four the way it did last year with VCU and Butler making it back, and UConn-Butler becoming one of the worst finals ever. But Missouri wasn't going to win the national championship this year and neither was this Duke team, and so for this one Friday it was just fine seeing the NCAA basketball tournament they are constantly selling you being the one actually being played."

Kenny Vasoli used to be the singer and principal songwriter for the Starting Line, a Philadelphia band that was in the upper tier of the power-pop bands banging around the Warped Tour circuit. After that well ran dry, he tried his hand at experimental alt-rock with his Person L project. When Person L did not set the scene on fire, a Starting Line reunion seemed like the only way to go. Instead, Vasoli has rechristened himself Vacationer and immersed himself in trip-hop, “Pet Sounds,” the High Llamas, ’60s soundtrack music and Vampire Weekend’s preppy take on Afropop. “Gone,” the first Vacationer album, is a dream-trip to the tropics with just a bit of an uneasy chill hidden in the trade winds. Muffled funk beats, samples with sudden endings, sugar-sprinkle organ, reverbed backing harmonies, thick dub bass and Vasoli’s relaxed if slightly paranoid vocal performances — which may shock those who remember how he used to scream with his old band — add to the atmosphere of a journey abroad that has slid into wistfulness and decadence. Highlights include the gauzy “Having it All” and the brisk “Summer End,” which translates the Starting Line’s urgent cold-weather power-pop into a California dialect.
