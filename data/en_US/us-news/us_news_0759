“This is not a hot building,” he said. “This is kind of a stage, a Broadway stage. It has a history and an energy to it, but it's not one of those where you can't hear…This is more of a stage than an intense building like Oklahoma City or something like that.”

"A lot of times our bigs are out of position because of rotations and coverages, and Faried was able to come in and get on top of them and crashing the glass," said Bryant, who had 22 points and eight rebounds Sunday. "We got in there mixed it up and tried to control the glass."

Womack's own life story has been part Shakespearean tragedy, part “Zelig.” Not unlike the main character in the Woody Allen movie, Womack has wandered in and out of key scenes in the history of rock 'n' roll and rubbed elbows with the music's most famous superstars.
Yao says his left foot, which suffered fractured bones at least three times, is fine, "good enough for walking, but not good enough for playing in a basketball game," but he looks a little chunky. That happens when you stop working out and start working.
Sound familiar? Thomas Vinterberg and Mogens Rukov’s drama was adapted from their acclaimed 1998 Danish film. A 2006 production starring Ali MacGraw and Julianna Margulies flopped on Broadway, but this adaption — from Poland’s TR Warszawa company, performed in Polish, with English subtitles — is stunnning.
Mavromatis, the skipper, had raced the event seven or eight times and won it twice in the boat's class with the same crew, he said.

Herrera was a baseball star at Laguna Creek High School (graduating in 2004) and played for two years at the University of Arizona before leaving school before his senior year in 2007. But he said he never really took care of his body. And when his father, Ted, died of a heart attack only two weeks after Teddy returned home from Tucson, it got him thinking.
The latest bill calls for a sweeping restructuring of the subsidies that were championed by former Gov. Ted Kulongoski. One legislative staff member referred to the bill as "a type of euthanasia for the existing BETC."
Undersheriff Cynthia Scott said there was no impropriety. She said "chief" is shorthand for "chief warrant officer." Scott also pointed to the state Department of Personnel’s website, which says chief warrant officers can act outside of their job descriptions and assist "the sheriff and undersheriffs in all department areas as assigned."
Meanwile, Cavs center Zydrunas Ilgauskas suffered a broken nose in the second half of last night's game, but continued to play. A post-game exam by Phoenix Suns team doctors revealed the fracture. He is listed as probable for tonight's game.

But back to Obama's speech. He described how companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Well, yeah. If they keep profits out of the United States they escape the U.S. corporate tax rate, now at 35 percent  39 percent if you count the average state tax.

I've been testing the Droid Razr Maxx, which has been out since late January, and found it delivers far greater battery life than any smartphone on which I've run battery tests. In one test, it lasted more than 20 hours in mixed, moderate use, including voice calls, video playback, and lots of Web and apps usage, plus downloading hundreds of emails. I also conducted a simulated, continuous test voice call, which the phone powered through for more than 20 hours before dying. And it played videos back to back for more than 14 hours before the battery gave up.
So Missouri seems destined to be an afterthought in 2012. Unless it does something dramatic.
On Tuesday, Megaro's West Hollywood condo was the site of the first fitting for a dress that needed to be completed four days later.

AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Sergio Garcia thinks the only major title he'll ever have is this: best player never to win one.
* Now we are seeing why the two-goalie system worked so magnificently for the Blues during the regular season. I never understood it when some fans or even media demanded that coach Ken Hitchcock pick one goalie and ride with him all the way. Jaroslav Halak and Elliott are great as a tandem. But if one has to carry the load by playing a long string of games, their respective vulnerabilities are exposed. By toggling his goaltenders, Hitchcock kept both guys confident and in sharp form. He was able to work around little slumps and lapses and prevent his two goaltenders from going south. With Halak injured and down, the ecosystem has been damaged.
"We look to the government of Pakistan to do more," Clinton said. "It needs to make sure that its territory is not used for launching pads for terrorist attacks anywhere.

Where Helms comes from originally is upper-class Atlanta, where his mother was a school administrator and his father was an attorney. His family went to the theater regularly, and enjoyed sing-alongs — Helms still has a deep, if somewhat guilty love for a cappella — but the idea of show business as a career was fairly remote.
In March, Robert Smith, 28, of Mokena, pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting an underage student in 2010. At the time, Smith agreed to a six-year sentence, which was approved by the judge on Tuesday.
Why should I be able to predict with confidence that someone who wants to expand government-provided health care will also be in favor of gay rights, and of negotiating with Iran over their nuclear program rather than threatening a military strike? Or why should I be able to accurately predict the opposite?
And he came back with a bang, hitting his first home run of the season, a shot to left-center field in the third inning last night.
"Even if he did want to make that kind of increase in financial corporate debt, he wouldn't be able to do it that quickly, without moving the market," Mr. Nadig says. He likened the Pimco Total Return fund to a giant ocean liner and the ETF to a speedboat.

Prices are heartening at Interurban, with nothing over $15 and many options under $10. The food is clearly a co-star here; the drinks are admirable, and recognizable from the other restaurants, and they draw heavy attention, especially at the monumental bar. There's also a dining room upstairs, which seems more predictable, and demographically slightly different.
Crenshaw, who is black, is one of the featured troopers in the State Police’s latest recruiting campaign.
"I didn't really talk to (the Blues) during the year too much," Schwartz said. "I wanted to play (at Colorado College) as long as I could, but unfortunately we lost and this opportunity popped up right away. You can't turn down something like this. It's unbelievable."

There may be legitimate debates about legislative term limits. The current system, after all, allows legislative lightweights and know-nothings to grab leadership posts before many of them have even found the washroom.
“Sure,” she said.

Five straight Big Ten titles, five straight BCS bowls, perhaps that ended this year. Ohio State fans were ready to check the ticket prices at Disney World for a potential Orlando jaunt to the Capital One Bowl.
Those of you in that long line of people who think Jacoby Jones was to blame for the Texans' playoff loss at Baltimore aren't likely to be in the mood to hear about the positives he brought to the Texans.
But how did you decide this is what you wanted to do?
(Here's how one blogger rationalized it: "And while some might call the public outcry rude and embarrassing, isn't it worse to let someone continue to think that they look good, while everyone is whispering behind their back?")
Ware, a bit small at 5-foot-8, 170 pounds, will likely have a track scholarship to fall back on following the spring season, but he still wants to play football.
As good as Richardson is, the case against picking him at four has legitimacy. In a passing league, it is difficult to justify taking a running back in top five unless he is Adrian Peterson. Some of best running backs in NFL were taken after first round (two examples: Ray Rice, Baltimore Ravens, 2nd; Arian Foster, Houston Texans, undrafted). Browns don't need a great running back/game to be effective with West Coast scheme, and they have more pressing offensive needs.
McCarther, who lives on a pension and Social Security and needs a wheelchair to get around, was glad to hear federal prosecutors have hit the duo with fraud charges that carry 30 years in prison.
But the Giants knew Tuck’s injury was big — so much so that coach Tom Coughlin scoffed when asked after the game how Tuck’s absence had impacted his defense.
Big Sky's Mountain Village consists of a collection of several hotels and a smattering of bars, restaurants and shops surrounded by residential properties. I stayed in the slope-side Summit Hotel in a room overlooking the base lifts. The rooms there boast awesome views of the mountain and are quite convenient for reaching the slopes in the morning, but they're a bit less enjoyable if you're a light sleeper and the snowcats are grooming the snow below your window at 4 a.m.

None of your money moves to, or through, SaveUp. But SaveUp is notified every time you pay down a credit card or your student loan and add to your savings or even to your retirement plan at work - because you've linked to those accounts.

2012. By the way, do you pronounce it "Two thousand twelve," or "Twenty twelve"? Which is easier? Does it matter? Back in my days of French classes in school, it always astounded me how complex that language could make a year sound. For example (assuming my memory is mostly correct about this), to say "1991" in French is "Dix-neuf cent quatre-vingt-onze," which translates to "ten and nine hundreds, four twenties and eleven." No wonder they talk so fast, with all those extra syllables to squeeze in.
One of the joys of "The Big Year" -- for birders and nonbirders alike -- is watching Wilson, Martin and Black riff on birds. Even if this isn't a true send-up like "Best in Show" was for dogs, the idea of "competitive birding" is a built-in punch line.
But it was Winter's story, told to St. Petersburg Times readers by Pulitzer Prize finalist John Barry, that captured the world's attention. The baby bottlenose dolphin's tail got caught in a crab trap in 2005 and she was brought to the aquarium's marine hospital for mending. It was there that one of the world's leading prosthetists volunteered to craft her a silicone tail.
Meaningful reform almost certainly will need to be driven by someone from the outside.

And it's not available just anywhere. I can't grab a Mexican Chocolate Stout out of the fridge at my local liquor store. No, sir. It's available only at their brewhouse, a kind of a local "Cheers" where everyone knows your name.
Backfill with a 50/50 mix of soil and compost. Water slowly and thoroughly to allow the soil to settle. Water every five to seven days. Spread mulch around the base of plants to conserve moisture.
With that, we are pals. We look through the display of necklaces, and I explain the finer points of tying a lariat. Soon, he picks out a piece, one that manages the neat trick of being both delicate and bold. It is lovely.
She threw herself into researching childlessness, reading everything she could get her hands on, joining online discussions, listening to other women's stories of childless by infertility, or reluctant choice, trying, as she put it, "to contextualize myself in a larger humanity -- as opposed to my tiny pod of grief."

"I thank Rosie from the bottom of my heart for joining me on this journey. She has been an incredible partner, working to deliver the best possible show every single day," Oprah Winfrey said in a release.

I'm grateful to Rosie and the dedicated Rosie Show team for giving it their all."
“In reality, it’s not nearly as attractive,” Smith said.
9. One sincere question I have about Matheny: is he creative? As a catcher he was resolute in following the careful game plan for attacking hitters as devised by pitching coach Dave Duncan. Matheny never deviated much by adding his own touches. (Which makes him different from Yadier Molina, who will go his own way and make adjustments when picking up on something.) As manager, La Russa often thought outside the box. No one will be quite as creative as TLR, and we wouldn't expect Matheny to step in and be unconventional. But it will be interesting to watch Matheny grow and develop as a manager; a personality will emerge. I'm just not sure what to expect. Like La Russa, Matheny will be be tough-minded, and he'll try to be a strong leader. Other than that, the scouting report is blank. Matheny has a lot to prove. Will he be his own man? If it's believed that Mozeliak is pulling Matheny's strings, the young manager will lose credibility.
"Organizations are spending a lot more time training and recruiting volunteers," Quirk said. "They need to spend more time bringing people on board."

Charity care: The region's safety net hospital had anticipated an increase in free care for the poor, but the need has been greater than projected. So far, MetroHealth has provided $166.3 million in free care, up nearly 11 percent from $148.6 million in the same period last year. The system budgeted to spend $160.2 million to date.

October saw the launch of the iPhone 4S, and the addition of Sprint Nextel Corp. as an iPhone carrier in the U.S.
The tweaks here and there actually improve the film. The best move is ditching the first-person narration by Katniss, something always hard to pull off on film. Since Lawrence, so tremendous in "Winter's Bone," is such a powerhouse of an actress, we simply don't need it. We feel her fear at the Reaping and in the games, as well as her steely inner strength. The scene in which she says goodbye to the younger sister, Primrose (Willow Shields), whom she volunteers to stand in for, is wrenching.
Irving acknowledged Scott had prepared him correctly.
Under the Bend plan, the land owners, not the food carts themselves, are responsible for the permits and improvements, something that makes Astro Lounge owner Josh Maquet skeptical of the idea's effectiveness.
This marks the seventh playoff series between the Rangers and Capitals and Washington has taken four of those six matchups. The Capitals beat New York in the conference quarterfinals in both 2009 and 2011, winning last year's series in just five games.

Two decades after the Supreme Court first upheld the right to test for drugs in the workplace, Dura's concern -- that employees on certain medications posed a safety hazard -- is echoing around the country. The growing reliance of Americans on powerful prescription drugs for pain, anxiety and other maladies suggests that many are reporting to work with potent drugs in their systems, and employers are grappling for ways to address that.
Hours after the Sept. 11 attacks, he sent a message to Hamid Mir, a Pakistani journalist who had interviewed him before, that read, "I don't have any link to the U.S. attacks, but I support it."
Under normal circumstances (a crew) could send a guy to the center lane and everybody could merge and off you go, Barfield said. Since you dont have that extra lane at Long Beach _ you have that half lane _ when he realized he was going and there was a car coming, he didnt have that extra lane.
He argued that opening his budget plans to public scrutiny during the campaign would galvanize the opposition before the process could start. He insisted he would bring legislators together, engage in the process with more intensity and endurance than any governor in memory and push for a consensus on tough decisions that could be sent to the voters for approval on the ballot-required moves in a spring special election.
One of the things about Bird is, he likes to let you think he's the Hick from French Lick, likes people to underestimate him. It gives him an advantage. And yet he's so limited, he's soon going to pull off the rarest trifecta of all -- winning MVP as a player, Coach of the Year in 1998 and he should win this year's Executive of the Year.

Young met Altariq Gumbs, aka "Killer Reek," authorities say, while they were both locked up and recruited Gumbs to join the gang. They say he promoted Gumbs to lead a Newark-based subset of the gang, known as the Brick City Brims. Gumbs, 33, who pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate RICO in July, was made the "Double Original Gangster," or "OOG," the gang’s second-highest ranking position in New Jersey.

My cozy, deluxe queen room, $299 a night, was decorated in a modified Middle Eastern theme. Tall, padded headboards upholstered in a vivid Turkish embroidery anchored two queen beds. The almost decadently plush, pillow-top mattresses were covered in silky sheets and a white cotton duvet stuffed with down and anchored with a wide bolster that matched the striped curtains. The room was quiet, blissfully so at night.

When flowers are produced in color temperatures, their colors are deeper. Thankfully, temperatures in recent weeks have been much coolor. Our deep pink geraniums and drought-tolerant vincas now look fluorescent. Ditto the magenta-purple zinnias whose seeds were given to me by a friend. Medium-pink zinnias have turned “hot” pink. Even pale pink impatiens that looked almost white in August are blushing.

While his athletic success seemed to come effortlessly, Owens struggled to translate his fame back home into the respect he felt he deserved. Back in New York City after Europe, he and his wife had trouble finding a hotel that would put them up, and when they finally did, they had to use the servants' entrance. Splashy contract offers made to him in the afterglow of the Games faded away. He was reduced to ignominiously running races against horses in embarrassing exhibitions. After financial missteps, he declared bankruptcy.
And judging from the pockets of empty seats at Wednesday's game against New Jersey, and my email inbox, more and more fans are losing confidence that this management team will give them a reason to renew before the April 12 deadline.

Trials are free to patients, who may receive small stipends or travel reimbursement. Drug companies and other researchers typically pay recruitment firms or advertise for volunteers, but frequently come up short. Doctors often don't mention the option of participating in a trial to patients, in part because they aren't aware of them or lack the time, resources or staff to enroll their patients.
Scientists who work on the island have voiced concern that in the effort to build new attractions, the conservancy might get distracted from its core mission of conservation. However, recreation and education are also part of the mission. The question is how to accomplish those goals — and protect the island — while ensuring that the conservancy has the funds to do so.

The 4,000-seat Colosseum was purpose-built for Dion’s previous Caesars Palace run — five consecutive years of sold-out shows for her “A New Day” extravaganza, which set a new standard for Vegas residencies. When it ended in 2007, Dion embarked on a triumphant yearlong world tour that was seen by more than 3 million fans. She then took a well-earned break, during which she gave birth to twins. But her sheer passion for singing and the stage brings her back to Vegas with an all-new show designed exclusively for the Colosseum.

Both television appearances gave Christie the chance to talk about his lack of interest in running for vice president. “I don’t think I’m the type of personality who is going to be asked by anybody to run for vice president,” he said, still neglecting to rule it out. “They’d have to hire a food taster. They wouldn’t want that.”
But English was still battling in the courts. In December 2006 she won a compensation judgment for $1.15 million, and the county then agreed to let her develop eight lots in lieu of paying her. But the approval contained conditions that English and her attorney found unacceptable, so the fight continued even as Measure 49 settled the issue for most of the state.
I don't imagine I'll ever give up on the institutional Church. I'm not one who thinks that being spiritual is superior to being religious. But it's not impossible that the Church can sometimes lose sight of what it means to pattern ourselves after the kingdom of heaven.

The Huskies ended the regular season playing well and are prepared to go after their eighth national championship. UConn avenged two of its losses in the Big East tournament, beating St. John's and Notre Dame, to claim the tournament championship. The Huskies are well-balanced with a number of go-to players. Tiffany Hayes, a 5-foot-10 senior guard, is the top scorer (15.1) and a solid rebounder (5.7). Freshman forward Kaleen Mosqueda-Lewis (14.8 points, 5.2 rebounds) has had an impact inside and on the perimeter, making 39.4% on 85 three-point baskets.

The change of heart is an ominous portent for the decades-long process of increasing European economic integration. The common currency is the centerpiece and the leading symbol of that integration. If enthusiasm wanes for the euro, boosters fear, this could spell trouble for other efforts to knit the nations of the Continent together.
Another protection is California Penal Code sections 832.7 and 832.8, which prohibit police disciplinary files from being publicly released without court approval. Passed in 1978, these sections were written by the office of then Attorney General Evelle Younger and carried by Assemblyman Dennis Carpenter, a former FBI agent from Newport Beach. Younger and Carpenter are now deceased. Both had publicly expressed concern that criminal defendants were using the disciplinary records of arresting officers to fight criminal convictions. The new law would prevent defendants from "fishing" through the records, authorities said at the time.

Suskind, in particular, pushes his quest for villains far beyond his evidence. At various points, he portrays Geithner as a master manipulator, defying a clueless young president. Even as a reader ponders the plausibility of that picture, he switches field, describing the Treasury secretary as feckless, callow and out of his depth. A reader suffers similar whiplash trying to follow Suskind's portrayal of Summers: a brilliant and imperious economist who alienated many of his colleagues.
“I was pretty much a mess after primary school,” Theron volunteers. “So by the time I got to high school, I was kind of broken in and more immune to all that (mean girl) stuff. I wasn’t really in the popular crowd. I went to art school, I was kind of obsessed with ballet, I wore really, really nerdy glasses. I was blind as can be. And boys don’t really like big nerdy glasses. Not so much.”
When he is in New Jersey, Menendez starts his days with breakfast at his usual spot, the International House of Pancakes in Union City. Then it’s a constant drone of calls and meetings that go deep into the night. When he can, the senator makes quick trips in and out of Manhattan to squeeze in some DSCC fundraising and then it’s back to Jersey. It’s an endless loop of calls, nondescript offices, fundraising sessions, highways, and rushing from a room to a train to a car to a plane to a pack of cookies that’s supposed to stop the hunger headache that has already started.

It is hard to pinpoint when exactly Vincent van Gogh crossed over from being a mere titan of modern art to a general symptom of our culture—a painter whose name adorns bottles of vodka and whose supposedly liberating madness is regarded with worshipful reverence. Twenty-five years ago, his paintings ushered in the era of stratospheric prices for leading Modernists, with the sale of "Sunflowers" for $39.7 million and "Irises" for $52.9 million—at the time, three- and fourfold increases over the previous world record for any work of art. Not long after that, Japanese industrialist Ryoei Saito set a new mark again by paying $82.5 million for "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" and then suggested that he might have it cremated and buried with him.
Weeks and months of rehabilitation followed the stroke. First she got full use of her face back, then began to teach herself the basics again: how to walk, how to open doors, how to live.

Yet it's a fine line that Vazquez Mota must tread because she represents a party, National Action, or the PAN, that is very conservative on many of the social issues considered most important to women.

Six regional affiliates, including Team NEO, would form the JobsOhio Network -- the replacement for publicly employed development directors once scattered across the state.

States have slashed college funding nearly everywhere; the schools have to make up the difference somewhere. But has it reached and passed the tipping point?

Kyrillos already fired a deadly salvo when he said Menendez should not sit in on a Senate investigation into the collapse of MF Global, former Gov. Jon Corzine's firm. It was Corzine who tabbed the then Hudson County congressman to fill the seat he vacated when he became governor. Of course the U.S. senator painted Kyrillos, well, as a Republican who likes millionaires. And the campaign is just getting started.

It's not that Europeans couldn't use Canadian oil. European countries are currently negotiating for oil with post-Gaddafi Libya without really yet knowing who they're dealing with. They've been importing it from Russia, contributing to Vladimir Putin's oil-for-influence program. Not too long ago, Russia shut off Europe's oil tap because it got into a tiff with Belarus, and the pipeline to Europe runs through that country. All these headaches, and yet Europe doesn't currently ship in any oil from Canada, although it quite feasibly could -- if it weren't for blatant protectionism cloaked in environmentalism.

Waszak wants to expand the village's tax base, which used to be heavily based on trucking; maintain its infrastructure and still retain the village's semi-rural character. It's the same work he's already doing on behalf of the village as the economic development chief. It should be a smooth transition to the mayor's office.
One obvious example is in the book of Job, in which God authorizes the infliction of suffering on an innocent man to prove to Satan that Job will be loyal to Him. Job responds, however, by cursing the day he was born and threatening suicide, which he imagines would somehow punish God for the injustice he is suffering. "Soon I'll be lying in the earth," Job says. "When you come looking for me, I'll be gone."

Among the secrets of success that Romney might wish to share is how you arrange to be born to a rich family. Or, to be less vulgar, to be born to an intact and loving family that valued education. Or, for that matter, to be born smart. The neocon controversialist Charles Murray writes books arguing that the second and third factors (family and innate intelligence) are more important than the first (money). You can argue about this all day, but in Romney's case it doesn't matter because he had all three factors hard at work, paving his way to success.

Oh, brother. The U.S. private investor, who spent most of the 2009-10 rally getting out of stocks, started piling in again earlier this year. According to the Investment Company Institute, investors cashed out a net $31 billion from equity mutual funds between the start of March 2009 and the end of last year. But since Jan. 1, they have shoveled a net $33 billion back in. History has frequently shown that the public gets in—and out—at the wrong times, buying near peaks and selling near troughs.

Joey Vento opened Geno's Steaks across the street in 1966 in a bid to take down the reigning cheese-steak champion, proclaiming: "If you want to sell cheese steak, you go to where they eat cheese steaks."
"The tug of party loyalty is a lot stronger than these groups acknowledge. I don't see how they get around that," he said.

Deb Nardone, director of the Sierra Club's "Beyond Natural Gas" campaign said there are concerns that under the rule disclosure would only be done after the fracking process is completed. The Sierra Club wants advance notice of 30 days to landowners disclosing all the chemicals that may be used in the fracking process, she said.
It has lived on as screenplay-meets-novel, though, enjoying a number of editions -- thanks in no small part to his impressionistic take on the blues legend. Greenberg used the same impressionistic approach for his brilliant 1982 documentary about Jamaica and Bob Marley, "The Land of Look Behind."
Research teams have been holding training sessions for farmers throughout the Pacific Northwest. One is scheduled March 30 at the Airport Sheraton Hotel in Portland.
It was only after a public outcry that prosecutors charged the two officers with illegal arrest and harsh treatment, although not with murder.
But throughout nearly its entire history, Constellation's presence in Baltimore has been tenuous. In the 1990s, a proposed merger between BG&E and PEPCO was to take it (and BG&E) out of the city to a new headquarters in Annapolis. A decade later, Constellation tried to sell itself to Florida Power & Light; then, amid a bankruptcy scare, it was almost bought out by Berkshire Hathaway but instead sold part of its nuclear business to the French firm EDF. This week's sale to Exelon, then, comes as no surprise, and even as that deal was being debated, there was little doubt that even if it fell through, Constellation would soon be looking for a new partner. Its growth strategy depended on it.
34: KC pressuring again as the ball is passed over to a wide open Milos Stojcev, who doesn't use the time he has and instead takes a shot way off line.
In his midseason struggles, much of the damage against Bryant has come when he has failed to keep the ball down. Sporadic opportunities haven’t helped, either.
"I think anyone who has banged around the planet, as you are bound to in a military career, has seen enough of human misery," he told The Bee.

Jesperson was charged with the latest felony murder in September and is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday.
Not since the racial pioneering era of black athletes in the 1940s and '50s have we seen a group of world-class American athletes who graciously handle such farfetched burdens as the women on the U.S. World Cup team. Carrying generations of aspiring young female footballers on your back in 2011 may not be quite up to the demands of hoisting an entire race on your shoulders in 1951, but there are some notable similarities.
It was unclear whether any additional money would be available for offenders' drug treatment.
If not for Tebow, the Broncos may have been picking in the top five for a second consecutive year. They may have been picking closer to 6:30 p.m. They may have been in position to draft another Von Miller.

Put the two greats of the game on opposite ends of a court in a Grand Slam final — particularly at Roland Garros, on the red clay that Nadal rules — and the one-sided nature of the rivalry grows even more pronounced.
We've also cut the amount we devote to entertainment, eating out and car purchases.
But if her pain is in both legs and she had a replacement in only one, it most likely isn't the replacement but another issue. So get her to an internist, and make sure it isn't some other issue that's easier to resolve.

Fair enough, but let's focus on the public asset in play here.
"Our friend had on his Tilley hat," she recalls. "Then a man walked up to him and said, 'Has anyone ever told you that you have a great-looking hat? You have a fine hat. My name is Alex Tilley.' "
Polycystic ovary syndrome, a fairly common female condition, is one of the chief conditions that produce hirsutism. The involved woman's ovaries are studded with cysts. Ultrasound examination of the ovaries shows them. Menstrual periods are few and far between.
At issue was a state law that prohibits sexually oriented businesses from operating within 1,000 feet of homes, public parks, houses of worship or residential development.
It is largely the same script and scenes, except the snow on the ground has been replaced by grass -- a digital sleight-of-hand. A white-jacketed barber still watches in awe as the horses pass by his shop window. The horses still trot down a cobblestone street and across a bridge.
Danny Gokey, an 'American Idol' finalist, took the stage first for a 20-minute set including "I Will Not Say Goodbye."

The iPad has almost all of the components and resources it needs to serve as an all-around computer. The hardware is more than powerful enough and the apps have never been more sophisticated. Developers have freed themselves from the notion that an iPad app should be a simple, single-function tchotchke. Many of the apps released in the past year are the equal of any desktop app targeted towards the same type of user. We're seeing plenty of the kind of software that can be used to conceive, create, refine, finalize, and then distribute content without any need to move the project to a desktop OS at any point.
Eventually Watts got a tip that Reggie Pettus of the New Chicago Barber Shop in the Fillmore might know what happened to the pictures.
Who, really, is he?
A study commissioned by Clayton last fall found that county schools would be hit with about 13,500 new students from St. Louis - many of them enrolled in private or charter schools - if the statute were enforced. An additional 2,200 students already in county schools as part of the voluntary desegregation program would transfer to a different school.
A demanding restaurateur in her heyday, McKenzie operated the four-star Copper Beech Inn in Ivoryton for eight years and then Robert Henry's in New Haven. Robert Henry's, now known as the Union League Cafe, is owned by McKenzie's eldest daughter, Robin, and her husband, a chef.
Keeping association dues down keeps membership up. Members pay whatever they can afford annually. "Ten dollars to $10,000," says Feller, who is always on the lookout for new and, especially, young members. "We want to make it so everyone can be culturally and historically aware and be part of the community."
The FDA's Office of Criminal Investigation looked into the Georgia plant that distributed the tainted peanuts, and the FBI executed search warrants.
"This move reinforces my strong opposition to President Obama and his auto task force trying to micromanage the American auto industry from the White House," Jordan said in a news release. "This industry, like any other, is best run by those who know it best -- not the federal government."
The French ban on burqas and niqabs goes before Senate in September amid predictions it will pass, but its biggest hurdle could come when France's constitutional watchdog scrutinizes it later.
(Update: In a phone conversation La Russa told me that he has, for many years, empowered select players to make decisions on their own, based on their feel for the game situation. Pujols is one; La Russa mentioned Edgar Renteria as another.)
Born: Sept. 5, 1949, in Amarillo, Texas
I enjoyed the Hedges CMS with friends while watching the World Series. It was a hit with a meal of bratwurst, veggie burgers and French fries. This wine would also go well with grilled lamb chops.

The UC announcement also noted Khosla's fundraising prowess, something officials have said will become even more important for California's public universities as state support continues to wane amid budget pressures.
Point: Daniel J. Mitchell
The service is friendly and conscientious, and we couldn't seem to get anyone in the place to show any disdain, smugness or shortness. Downtown, it's Zelda's world and the customers just live in it. But out in the burbs, that whole grouchy and gruff shtick might seem too jarring, if not too contrived.
Henriot Brut "Souverain" Champagne, Reims, France ($35-$42) - The color is deep golden and carries to the rim. The aroma is complex with a pleasant yeasty-toasty quality. The rich, toasty taste has a tart Chardonnay finish. 91 points.

Both Gee and Collins were encouraged by Gee’s stamina. He retired nine of the last 10 batters he faced.
The rock band established itself during the late '70s, producing such hits as Renegade, Babe and The Best of Times. Years later came the synth-based favorite Mr. Roboto, which still gets crowd doing the robot. After a series of multiplatinum albums, a breakup and reunion, the band is back touring around the world. Styx will play a 45-minute set, followed by the countdown to midnight and a fireworks show.
"It's big," Miller said of the sixth seed. "Knowing what we've been throughout the season — guys having been injured and sitting out. Six sounds better than eight. That's something when you look at the politics side. It's good. Glad it's over. Took a lot of hard work by everybody. So we get to relax for one game."
early in the season, Thomas faced a barrage of criticism on message boards for not keeping the ball more on Oregon's option plays.
“We truly welcome your comments and we will work even harder to balance this year’s budget and strengthen you confidence in us,” said Acton. “Once we have a clearer understanding of its severity we will openly communicate the findings to you our residents and our valued employees.”

The Orioles drew 31,532 for the second home game of the season on Saturday night, which is quite a step up from the crowd of 12,451 that attended the second home game of 2011. That puts the Orioles almost 20,000 ahead of last year's pace.
Others, such as Sy Waranch, 25, are open about sexuality and see the show and program as a long time coming.
"These racial differences are not just genetic. There are social and system differences that largely drive them," Byers said. Behavioral differences also widen the gap, through higher use of tobacco and other lifestyle risks, he said.

It's also uncertain whether companies providing temporary farm laborers to growers will be required to offer health coverage to those workers or pay the penalty. The congressional analysis says they would if the temporary agency actually employs the workers.
The DS screens offer two views of the action, with the top screen providing angles only a weather helicopter might manage. But the ground-level detail in the lower screen will grab your attention and the silly chores assigned through each step of the game will keep it there.
New metal: Rock-metal band Marjorie's Cane will celebrate the release of debut disc "Killer of Killers" with a party Friday at the New Dodge Bar in Hamtramck. Over Macho Grande, Flatland Star and Cobra Frank will open the show.
I loved that the place was full of people and energy, but that there was still plenty of room to breathe. The space is divided into a variety of areas - some wide open, some intimate and lounge-y - so I didn't have to dodge elbows all night. A huge, enclosed rooftop patio had drawn a crowd and was less navigable, but we decided not to stick around there because of all the cigarette smoke.
If that sounds as if everything were under control, it is -- maybe too much so.
But that's just being a mom, I think. We want our babies to have the very best, and we'll do whatever it takes to give them just that. And, listen up, marketers: we'll trust other moms over fancy product descriptions any day.

Osgood and I drove around for a long time looking for what was once a familiar city sight: a school wall with a "strike zone" painted or chalked onto it.
I've always been a fan of Limon's marinated chicken thighs ($9) with salsa criollo. This time the meat was as bronzed, crisped and delicious as I remember, but the dipping sauce had an acidic kick and added little.
The man's name? Martin Foradori Hofstätter.
Those who believe they have a fundamental right to receive low-yield, ineffective and harmful care are sure to invoke the "R-word": rationing. But let's hope they at least have the good sense not to say it while at the same time arguing for less government spending because they don't want to bankrupt their children.
CRM Real Estate Services of Cleveland still aims to build apartments above a planned hotel in the historic Schofield Building, at East Ninth Street and Euclid, and in the small Truman Building, at 1030 Euclid Ave.
"I decided not to ease into it. I just decided to cut everything bad and start working out as much as possible the first day. I wanted to shock my body into losing weight."
Whoops. I said I didn't want to talk about that, didn't I? I'm like a magpie, distracted not by shiny objects but by overblown news stories. I do want to talk about the bad rap Christmas has been getting from some quarters, but its not the atheists or ACLU complaining this time. It's people on Team Jesus.
Once inside, Joe Wilkins reunited with his son.
It's the largest graduating class in Ramapo history.

That document absolutely should have been turned over, said John P. O'Connor, another of the defense attorneys. I don't see the government holding back that report on purpose, but that doesn't matter under the rules governing discovery in criminal court.
Far from the partying on the infield, there was plenty of glitz and glamor from Millionaire's Row to the red carpet.
Stockbroker Aaron Meisner sincerely hopes that the Smiths have a nice time sitting out in the sun over the weekend when the thermometer inches up into the 90s and the humidity rises. He'll personally feel terrible if thunderstorms (currently estimated at a 40 percent probability for Sunday) spoil their day.
"It was like an electrical circuit was completed," he says.
Still, I couldn't help feeling that a little less austerity and a little more verve might have been more persuasive. Aimard's playing caught more of the ascetic intensity in Kurtág's work than the subtle perfume that can emerge from it, and his Schumann was defiantly colorless.
No. You know what's childish? A 64-year-old coach selfishly preventing a young adult from making decisions that could better his life.
At least what the National Football League must do, he says, is spend as much money as it has for treatment and equipment, to minimize the problem. Boxing? Beyond help.
"Pump Boys and Dinettes" — Theo Ubique Cabaret Theatre

On this day, 10 years later, the on-duty firefighters and lieutenants of Northwest Portland's Station 3 are among a handful of fire stations represented at a ceremony held on Portland's Eastbank Esplanade to honor the firefighters, medical crews and police officers who lost their lives on Sept. 11, 2001.
Any suggestion that "there was a back channel" through which News Corp. influenced his decisions "is categorically not the case," Hunt told lawmakers, some of whom heckled him.
The Mass came at the end of the three-day ScoutQuest 100, a celebration of a century of scouting that brought more than 10,000 Scouts and leaders to Forest Park.

But as Mr. Scott examined "sedentarization" (making mobile people settle down), he realized this practice was simply part of a more fundamental drive of the state: to make the whole population legible to the state. The premodern state was "blind" to its subjects. But the modern state was determined first to see them, and then organize them. This is why so many rulers pushed for the universal usage of last names starting around 1600 (aristocrats had been using family or clan names for centuries already). The same goes with the push for more accurate addresses, the standardization of weights and measures, and of course the use of censuses and surveys. It's much easier to collect taxes, conscript soldiers, fight crime and put down rebellions if you know who people are and where they live.
Mike Porenta, 32, was tired of his 90-minute commute from his home in Ypsilanti to work in downtown Detroit when Quicken Loans made an offer that was too good to pass up: $2,500 toward the rent on a new lease within a 5.58-square mile area of Detroit.

CUYAHOGA RIVER RE-BIRTHDAY PARTY
Which is what "Carmina burana" has been for some time. Soprano Cyndia Sieden has the right voice for it - clear and sweet with just the right touch of vibrato. Her climactic aria could have been delivered with a bit more abandon while some of her softest passages needed better breath support. David Adam Moore's rich baritone would have been even more impressive had he added a more confident personality to his character.
"60 Minutes" pioneered the use of "ambush interviews," with reporter and camera crew corralling alleged wrongdoers in parking lots, hallways, wherever a comment - or at least a stricken expression - might be harvested from someone dodging reporters' phone calls. They were phased out after Hewitt termed them "showbiz baloney."
As mentioned above, Delfino scored 11 points in the first quarter. He has 11 at the half. Corey Maggette has 12 points for the Bucks off the bench, but only 4 attempts from the line (all makes). Center Andrew Bogut scored 7 for Milwaukee.

Another question being raised is about the money, that is our government's job to check where the money is coming from. Accusing a group without any iota of evidence is against the decency. Now that lots of people have questions about the funding I hope it is very transparent so that it does not become an issue.
The former House speaker surged in popularity in early December and tried to use that momentum to make up for a stalled campaign organization. But his standing in polls has slipped in recent days amid a barrage of negative ads in Iowa, where the Jan. 3 caucuses begin the contest for the Republican presidential nomination.

A short time later, Lesniak broke down in tears while reading a letter from a constituent, a woman whose brother is gay, thanking him for his efforts to pass a same-sex marriage law.
The show was far from three and a half hours of solemnities, though. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band brought their usual power to “We Take Care of Our Own” (see sidebar) and artists such as Bruno Mars and Chris Brown offered high-energy, visually elaborate production numbers.
The NFL divided the AFC and NFC into four divisions each prior to the 2002 campaign. The Browns, Steelers, Bengals and Ravens formed the AFC North Division, as, of course, they still do.

In the early 70s, at the beginning of Waitz's running career, the International Olympic Committee enforced an antiquated ban against women running any race longer than the 1,500 meters -- a distance just shy of four laps around the track. As history would soon show, 1,500 meters was about 25 miles short of Waitz's optimal racing distance, making her appearance at the 1972 Olympics that much more impressive.
Today -- 4:15 a.m. (1), 10:30 a.m. (2), 4:40p.m.(1), 10:55 p.m.(2)
The report (http://www.advancekc.org/documents.html) did place Kansas City in a bit larger national context. Market Street Services used Indianapolis, Oklahoma City and Charlotte as our benchmark cities. The first line in the draft preamble was pretty blunt.

Emmert, who is now supporting Savas, declined to identify who attended the meeting.
Bauchinger said he and Saunders first met Cook by chance in Panama between February and April 2008. Cook was trying to open an investment bank, he said, but the bank never got off the ground. A few months later, Saunders evaluated Cook's currency investment program and in August 2008, he wrote a "legal opinion letter" stating that Oxford Global had $4.48 billion in assets under management. The newspaper obtained a copy of the letter, which says that Oxford Global's currency arbitrage accounts had produced average returns of 11 percent. "All accounts had 100% liquidity," the letter says.

Nowhere, perhaps, is Japan's vein of conformity as apparent as it is in death: 99.9% of Japanese who passed away in fiscal 2009 were cremated, according to the country's health ministry. But the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that shook Japan's people, its industries and its environment have also eroded the certainty of how many thousands of Japanese will be laid to rest.
They wouldn't give their names but described the ceremony as festive and inspiring.
So if Baltimore scores early and looks like it's going to win, the Steelers could pull all of their key players from the Cleveland game to protect them against injury.
But the bulkiness of the equipment prompted Furst and McDonough to begin searching for manufacturers of lightweight camping gear. Realizing that there was a growing market for such equipment, they decided to shift careers and open their first store — the Mountain Shop in Wellesley, Mass. Renamed Eastern Mountain Sports, it was soon the largest outdoor equipment outlet in New England. The partners also opened the EMS Climbing School in North Conway, N.H., now the oldest rock-climbing school in the Eastern United States.

If Jake Peavy can just be healthy and contribute a little: Surprise, because Peavy has done more than even he could expect. Of course, it's a long season.
Egyptian authorities also ordered that the country's roughly 300,000 pigs be killed as a preventive measure and have finished off about a third of the job in a couple of weeks.

Over the last 10 years, our state has become better prepared. In the years ahead, we must work to become more resilient.

"I like to think that (like others in the community did with other members of the team) Brianna and myself did help with Meghan becoming the athlete that she is," Katelyn said. "She was always tagging along to all of our practices - volleyball, basketball and soccer - she was there following us around. I feel like it is definitely also a community thing. At Orchard Farm, everybody feels like they are a part of it because of how awesome and close the community is. We are all a part of that."

The Department of Housing and Urban Development actually gave Antioch more block grant money than last year by about $6,000, a reflection of an increased poverty rate in the city, said Teri House, a city consultant.
"These are not things that are under my control, nor should they be," Wynn said. "They're very self-conscious about how they want that city to proceed, and what role we are to play in that procession. And so you end up sitting there quietly, waiting for the guidance and the leadership to make up their mind on when and how you should proceed."
O’Connell said it’s not likely the company will swap New Jersey for Chicago in its name, despite its deepening New Jersey roots. But noting Gov. Chris Christie’s recent comments that the Giants should be named after the state in which the team plays and most players live, he joked that perhaps CBOE could come under similiar pressure.

Today’s announcement will not affect the legal proceedings against Holly Grigsby, 25, who was Pedersen’s companion and is accused in the two Washington murders and the killing of Cody Myers, a Lafayette teen, and Reginald Alan Clark in Eureka, Calif.
With the loss of nuclear energy, the Ministry of Environment projects that Japan will produce about 15 percent more greenhouse gas emissions this fiscal year than it did in 1990, the baseline year for measuring progress in reducing emissions. In fiscal 2010, Japan's actual emissions were close to 1990 levels. It also raises doubts about whether it will be able to meet a pledge made in Copenhagen in 2009 to slash emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by 2020.

OK, we're making progress, she told him, liking his numbers. Taking your medicine is making a difference. And having your son here is making a big difference.
Some of the Broncos' 2012 selections were reaches and risks. Derek Wolfe wasn't a wow to the world, but he satisfies the demand for a promising defensive tackle who can cause havoc. Baylor's Philip Blake will compete with Baylor's J.D. Walton at center, and Tennessee's Malik Jackson will compete with Tennessee's Robert Ayers at defensive end. That's bizarre. Omar Bolden, an ACL casualty last year, could be a return man/dime back.
In February, the state-appointed board unanimously approved Isom's request for a $148.32 million operating budget, but City Hall offered $141.95 million. The two sides met at $143.4 million.

Defiance, which has a Democratic majority, though with a fiercely independent streak in the voting booth, is surrounded by a Republican-leaning county of suburbs and farms.

Again, Brown is appalled at a system that would tear a family apart against its will, ostensibly for its own good. "A person charged with murder gets to see his wife," Brown railed. "Dan White" - who murdered Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk in 1978 - "had conjugal visits."
It's a speculative argument. Presidents Bush and Obama, Congress and the Federal Reserve all took aggressive action in 2008 and 2009, from bailing out auto companies to injecting money into banks, and we can't know what they would have done differently if the nation wasn't paying for two wars.

SCOUTING REPORT: Don't expect either team to milk the shot clock on each possession. Look for a high-scoring, free-wheeling game featuring two of the top teams in the field. Kentucky averages 77.6 points per game to Kansas' 73.9. Kentucky's advantage is also having the No.1-ranked defense, limiting opponents to 34.7% shooting. The game features, arguably, the best and second-best players in the field in Kentucky center Anthony Davis and Kansas' Thomas Robinson. Kentucky tends to overwhelm opponents with its speed and transition game, and Kansas has a bad habit of pulling out wins after falling behind. The Jayhawks trailed Ohio State by 13 points five different times Saturday before rallying to win. Falling behind Kentucky by double digits is not recommended. Kansas Coach Bill Self says his team has reached the final without playing a great game in the tournament. Kansas needs to be near-perfect if it expects to cut down the nets.

The complaint further alleges that customers were charged between $100 for 15 minutes to $300 for an hour of illicit sex, and that all the proceeds were handed over to Porter by the women. Porter paid for their food and hotels, according to the complaint.
Further -- too late for the 6,200 American troops already killed -- the United States is considering using special operations units such as the SEALS to handle terrorist groups. Special ops teams are essentially the same as SWAT teams in police departments. Is this an admission that using the military was wrong? If so, why do our troops remain in Iraq and Afghanistan?
The trend speaks to a larger societal message, says Beth VanderYacht, a 35-year-old freelance writer from Livermore who attended one of Carle's Halloween pinup parties and ended up buying five $50 prints of herself, including a striking shot in devil horns and a red tutu.

Bold flavors culled from simple ingredients are one reason Bay Area chefs are creating a Peruvian renaissance. Anchored by San Francisco's La Mar and Limon and fueled by a deep respect for Peru's culinary contributions, restaurants from Berkeley to Redwood City are putting a modern spin on this ancient cuisine by sourcing local, organic ingredients, using French cooking techniques and reinventing Peruvian street food.
"When you played against John, the game was never over," said Ronnie Lott, the Hall of Fame defensive back. "He could make plays with his arm. He could beat you by escaping pressure, buying time for his receivers to get open, and firing the ball downfield. He was creative and confident and never backed off. You never felt that you had him down for the count. He'd get back up and come at you again."

GULFPORT — The powerful aroma of the fry-o-lator sucks you in first. You can practically taste the planks of golden cod doused in malt vinegar, an order of fries steeped in ketchup to finish things off. You turn off the road into a beachfront parking spot, the ground hot under your flip-flops. This is status quo in Barnstable, Falmouth, Woods Hole, Provincetown — anywhere on Cape Cod — but can it happen in Gulfport?
Richard Nary, who died of cancer April 14, just 16 months after his unlikely reunion with the family he had fled more than three decades earlier, made terrible mistakes in his life, the women agreed.
10. Tiger Woods, United States -- There was a time, not all that long ago, when we knew exactly what to expect of Woods. His play would range from good to great, and he could even win when he didn't bring his "A" game. That was even true coming off breaks that ranged from weeks to months, but what he will do in the Wells Fargo Championship when he returns to the PGA Tour this week after his worst performance as a pro in the Masters is anyone's guess. ... Tiger had an enviable record at Quail Hollow until he went there in 2010 after tying for fourth in the Masters, which was his first tournament following his infamous SUV accident in the early hours after Thanksgiving in 2009. He shot 74-79 in the Charlotte event and recorded one of the seven missed cuts in his career. Woods had finished no worse than a tie for 11th in his previous four trips to Quail Hollow and won what was then called the Wachovia Championship by two strokes over Steve Stricker in 2007. ... Only days after Sean Foley, Woods' instructor, said it was time for the constant evaluation of his client to end, Butch Harmon got in his two cents' worth. Harmon, who coached Woods when he turned pro, said Tiger's swing seems robotic and that he might have lost his nerve on the greens. Harmon also was asked about "The Big Miss," a book written by a third instructor, Hank Haney, about his time with Woods. Harmon said he never would write a book about any of his clients, which have included Woods, Greg Norman and Phil Mickelson.
President George W. Bush enjoyed a similar two-on-one advantage for many months of his second-term bid in 2004, with Vice President Dick Cheney at his disposal. Cheney publicly doubted Democratic nominee John Kerry's resolve on national defense, but the vice president didn't play a sustained role in criticizing the rival nominee this early on.
øAn All-American tantrum by Kelly on the sideline, caught by cameras, with red face, white-hot temper and blue vocabulary. "What I have to recognize is that I'm on TV all the time,'' he said a few days later. "Seems like it's on me more than I'm used to.''

"Mike is doing very well," oncologist Jack Cavalcant of Mesa said. "Here is a good illustration of why men, if they find a lump, should take it seriously."
"Talk about helixes," Weschler says. "There's a pair of twinned paradoxes at the heart of every portrayal. One is what everybody who is true to themselves knows: that everything is complete chaos. The other is that everything that happens happens exactly the way it had to happen; otherwise, it would have happened some other way. In both cases, the reporter has to figure out a way to write about it, which is necessarily a fictional activity. It's a fiction in the sense that it is a version, something I composed. At this moment, to the best of my ability, this is what it seems like. Borges says there are two worlds, the world of language and the world of reality, and they don't intersect at any point. And any attempt to fashion a representation of one in terms of the other is a fiction."
There is also a little bit of good news locally in terms of income, she said. In 2010 -- the most recent year for which numbers are available -- average per-capita income in Northeast Ohio rose by 3 percent, slightly more than the national increase.

It was a bitter pill for Portland to swallow after so much went their way. Dallas went without a field goal for more than 11 minutes in the second half.

"What purpose do these revelations, true or exaggerated, serve?

For sports, the time machines can help settle the debate between nostalgic fans and those who insist the games have never been played better. A paper a decade ago attempted to bridge the gap between baseball players over the past century. Co-authors Shane Reese and Scott Berry found that performance was improving, but not uniformly. For instance, baseball players' improvement in hitting home runs was much more dramatic than their batting-average gains -- perhaps because of steroids, which wasn't controlled for.

Playoff success is all about matchups (Pierce and Joe Johnson nullify each other), ball control, health (Hawks forward Al Horford’s absence will be striking) and who’s peaking.
