OK, I'm not a Colton fan. Maybe it's the hair. But give him Earth, Wind & Fire's "September," put him at the piano and turn the song into an emo ballad, and guess what? It works, for the most part. It's so far removed from the original that you can't compare, and it stands well on its own. This could be my favorite Colton song all season.

37. Rueben Randle, WR, LSU, 6-3, 210. Didn't run as well as some of the other receivers on the board - 4.5s at the combine, but rebounded with a 4.37 showing at his campus pro day - but plays with awareness to find the soft spots in coverage. He understands how to attack the defensive back to give himself some room and may even seek out a little too much contact at times.

But what's particularly frustrating is how Mr. McConnell is selling his proposal. In an interview with radio host Laura Ingraham, the senator explained his thinking: "If we go into default, (Mr. Obama) will say that Republicans are making the economy worse. ... The president will have the bully pulpit to blame the Republicans for all of this destruction," setting himself up for re-election.
Johnson, one of the few presidents who spent most of their adult lives in Washington, had no idea how to win the presidency. Convinced that the country was as mesmerized as Washington is by the Senate, Johnson did not formally announce his candidacy until six days before the 1960 convention.

A priest in the Belleville Diocese at odds with his bishop over the wording of the Catholic Mass said Belleville Bishop Edward Braxton told him in a meeting Tuesday that if he refused to resign as pastor of St. Mary's Catholic Church in Mount Carmel, Ill., the bishop would use canon - or church - law to remove him.

The challenger: Zone is unopposed.
The key point of the game came in the final six minutes of the third quarter. North went on a 13-0 run before South hit a bucket just ahead of the buzzer. Just like that, a close game turned into a comfortable lead for the Vikings, who were able to close it out with an equally strong fourth quarter.

It took Ireland 25 years to get into the crisis it faces today, and it might take 25 years to get out of it. But the foundations for a positive future are in place. The Irish can spread a good time wherever they go and brighten even the darkest of days. This St. Patrick's Day will be no different. The Irish people realize, as Oscar Wilde put it, that "ordinary riches can be stolen, real riches cannot."

In Troy, Mo., cutting bus service in August for about 950 secondary students who live less than 3.5 miles from school could save $200,000 to $300,000. The district, which has an annual budget of about $46 million, already cut a total of $8 million in the last two years. Superintendent Terry Morrow said teachers and administrators did not receive pay increases this year, and class sizes are some of the largest in the state, so there is no room to cut teacher positions.

Sushi geeks expecting a tranquil setting in which to meditate over stunninglyfresh raw fish and vinegared rice are in the wrong spot at Ginko, a modern and colorful eatery featuring the talented Taishi Noma, a tall, bespectacled chef with the bearing of a Zen master. To be sure, his fish and rice are worthy of contemplation -- if only the rock music blaring from the speakers would allow it. Instead, count on being lifted to a higher plane by righteously prepared maki and nigiri featuring, for example, fresh sweet scallops, lush toro, pink yellowtail and tender eel. Less traditional sushi dishes ("specialty sushi") are creations of chef-owner Dante Boccuzzi, who also owns Dante, the eatery above. I loved his offbeat Eye of the Tiger, a tasty cut-roll involving Japanese mayo, shiitake mushrooms and raw scallops. You might like foie gras with duck and freshwater eel on a thick pad of rice. Sushi geeks will appreciate the marvelously seasoned rice kernels that undergird fatty fish such as the tuna, particularly when served nigiri style (the best way to enjoy sushi, if not ordering omakase). Noma and his two assistants keep each piece in lovely balance. Bento boxes (offered during Friday-only lunch) are another way to get to know Ginko. Mine included a vegetable roll, crisp tempura vegetables and shrimp, and green salad with impeccably fresh raw salmon ($14.95). Mild miso soup is included in the price. Ask to sit in front of Noma, if possible, to watch a sushi master at work. -- David Farkas, Special to The Plain Dealer

McCain, another champion of Kyl and Kennedy's 2007 bill, came face to face with angry voters while campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination in Iowa and New Hampshire. His grass-roots fundraising temporarily dried up.

The reverberations continued to this year, when McCain found himself targeted for defeat in a bitter primary battle with former Rep. J.D. Hayworth, a border hard-liner.

The city is in the midst of a comprehensive citywide risk assessment study, and Kornfield says "preliminary results seem to indicate that wood-framed, "soft-story'' buildings, especially corner buildings, are one of a number of building types that could have a major impact on San Francisco if seriously damaged in an earthquake." The loss of such key buildings would affect affordable housing, small businesses, and the architectural and cultural fabric of the city.

According to the researchers, a woman's walk gives off subtle clues that can belie her sexual experience. The study found that observers were able to detect whether a woman had a history of vaginal orgasm through traditional intercourse simply by watching her cross the street.

The area is a mix of large vineyards, often owned by independent growers or large wine companies, and much smaller parcels. One intriguing new vineyard is Sierra Mar Vineyard, planted by Gary Franscioni, of Rosella's and Garys' vineyards and Roar Wines, in 2007. The 38-acre vineyard sits at just above 1,000 feet in elevation toward the warmer, southern end of the appellation.

Miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week. Fifteen to 20 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage, says the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The actual number may be even higher, because many occur so early that a woman may not even know yet that she's pregnant. Sometimes, even if fertilization is unsuccessful, placenta can begin to form, causing a false positive on tests.

The dog park improvements will cost about $330,000, and of that, about $50,000 -- funds for the three planned shelters -- will be paid for from a bond issue that passed in November. Aside from adding shade, shelter and water, the upgrades will also include a sandy fill material spread over the bulk of the park, a grassy area at the north end that can be closed off for dog training classes and other events, and a fenced-in area for smaller pooches.

Rumor has it that the next bridge that's going to be redone is the bridge on South Kingshighway, just south of Highway 44. Cost is expected to be $20 million. My question is this: Why is this bridge even there? Just tear it down and make it a straight four-lane street. Costs would have to be cheaper. It would definitely be safer. Both sides of the bridge now are on a downward slope. There's been countless accidents in the winter with this bridge. Tell MoDOT to beautify South Kingshighway. Tear the bridge down.

On the one hand, the industry cultivates an image of wine being an almost accidental beverage, a product of a munificent nature that takes ripe fruit from sun-dappled vineyards and somehow, magically, transforms it into a liquid symphony that can ennoble not only those who consume it but also those who make it.
Receiver is one of this draft's deepest positions. ESPN's resident guru, Mel Kiper, predicted more than 30 could be selected.

Escott: Rock 'n' roll didn't come from major labels, it came from labels that had their ear to the ground. Guys like (Sun Records founder) Sam Phillips had the insight and intuition to hear someone like Cash, who came in with a backing group that could barely play – just boom chick-a boom. And he realized that (Cash) needed no more than that. To take guys like Cash and Elvis, who'd never even played in public, and make them stars, that took genius.
Many projects that are solely funded by IDOT are progressing slowly through the engineering and environmental analysis phases. They include engineering funding for reconstruction of the Circle Interchange near downtown Chicago where the Dan Ryan (I-94), Kennedy (I-90/94) and Eisenhower (I-290) expressways converge. It is one of the most congested highway junctions in the nation.
Along the way, English mingles with stock characters on loan from the time-tested Bond formula. Kate (Rosamund Pike) is the beautiful, brainy female spy who's tough, sensitive, and slowly falling for our hero. Eager but untested rookie agent Tucker (Daniel Kaluuya) can't understand why he's so much smarter than his supposed mentor. And then there's English's chief rival, Ambrose, the near-perfect spy played by handsome Dominic West (who can't stop smirking, probably because he's thinking of the yacht he'll purchase using his "English" paycheck).
The mural will be best viewed from a distance, Rollings said, when it is finally hung.
For the longest freshness, the California Strawberry Commission recommends waiting to wash them until they are about to be used. They hold best refrigerated in the store's plastic clamshell or a container with dry paper towel at the bottom. Single layers of berries between paper towels maximizes freshness.

Illinois keeps borrowing money to invest in its pension funds, gambling that the funds' investments will earn enough to pay back the debt with interest. New Jersey simply decided not to pay the $3.1 billion that was due its pension plan this year.
Interestingly, this all goes back to what was known as the "marshmallow test," in psychological circles. Back in the 1960s, psychologists tested a group of kids to see how many would opt for one marshmallow now or two marshmallows at some undefined future time. Many of the kids wanted the one marshmallow, which we know as immediate gratification; some opted to wait. Years later, another study of the same group of kids showed that those who showed self-control by waiting (which they achieved successfully by distracting themselves from the marshmallow in front of them) did much better in school and work than the "I want it now!" group.
Poker face: Back at the poker night, the boys try hazing Derek. Meanwhile, Ashley gets offended when Jacqueline tells her she looks like her grandmother, who is apparently a larger woman, so Ashley huffs off and sits with the guys. Jacqueline follows. "You're such a 12-year-old," Ashley tells her mother, and Jacqueline kicks her out of the house. "God, I feel like I'm more mature than my mom," Ashley says. While that would not be a difficult feat, it is untrue in this case. Derek stays put.

As I walk a street, I glance down beside the doors of parked cars, since people (mostly guys) lose coins out of their pockets while entering and exiting their vehicles. Thus, commercial parking lots are more fruitful than residential streets, given the high volume of in-and-out car traffic.
Gasoline is in particularly short supply in the Great Lakes region, partly because of refineries that serve this area. Also, Marathon Oil Co. is one of the biggest gasoline operations in Ohio.

"They're very rigid in their thinking," McKenna explains. "They decide they want something and that's all they want to do -- like a little girl who wants to wear the same princess dress every day, even if it's filthy; or they might decide they want to only eat peanut butter for six months." She adds, "I think this is the clothing version of that."
Intrigued by the idea of connecting with the Bosnian community through dance, West a few years ago set about looking for dancers and choreographers who might help with the project. She learned that, for a while, there had indeed been a local Bosnian dance company - but that it had disbanded.

The film based on her life, however, doesn't do this remarkable tale justice.
