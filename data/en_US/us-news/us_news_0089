Your April 24 editorial was spot on. Why even waste money regulating plastic bags when it would be so much better to outlaw them in Illinois as other jurisdictions have?

The truly savvy fan is looking for the remote. You can still catch a few cartoons at noon Saturday. Failing that, note how Bulls strangle first and second and third options. The truth is, Philly doesn’t even have what you call consistent fourth options, so unless Spencer Hawes goes 6-for-10 from the arc, this won’t keep your interest for long.

Kevin Pelton, Basketball Prospectus: What Luke Babbitt proved over the last two months of the season is that he has an NBA skill in terms of his ability to shoot the three-pointer, which was up for debate during his limited action over his first year and a half in the league. Two things changed. First, Babbitt had the confidence to fire away knowing he wasn't headed back to the bench with a miss. Second, Kaleb Canales putting Babbitt at power forward really opened things up for him. Historically, perimeter-oriented tweeners tend to perform much better (and their team better) at the four rather than the three because it's easier to get open looks against slower defenders who don't like to step out on the perimeter. Babbitt looks like he's always going to have a tough time finding a good matchup defensively at either forward position, so the Blazers may as well at least maximize his offensive contributions by putting him at the four against most opponents off the bench.

Many of Meyer's recruits have transferred, not wanting to deal with a coach who actually holds them accountable for their actions.

The trip is relatively inexpensive in coach (about $150 each way), but the real deal is to spring for a roomette ($952 for a couple, including rail fare and meals). Other overnight alternatives include the Lake Shore Limited between Chicago and New York -- a dim reminder of the 20th Century Limited -- and two-night trips on the full routes of the Empire Builder and the California Zephyr.

The movie plays as if Hollywood executives said, hey, a "Dark Shadows" movie would be a fun project -- and never looked in on it again. Nowhere is the lack of discipline and structure more apparent than in the ending, which is a mess -- and, unlike most of the rest of the film, not even an interesting one. From anyone, this version of "Dark Shadows" would be a disappointment; from Burton, it's an even bigger one.

Wenders, armed with his 3-D camera, shoots the members of Bausch's Tanztheater Wuppertal ensemble in the cars of a gliding monorail, on busy street corners, on the barren ridge of an industrial wasteland, in sleek modernist buildings and elegant gardens. Many of the dancers - an ethnically and chronologically diverse crew of agile physical artists - get face time, reflecting on their relationship with Bausch, on how she impelled and inspired. (These "talking head" sequences, too, are gorgeous: close-ups of the individual dancers, with their monologues delivered in voice-over, as if we're listening in on their thoughts.)
The tragedies in Italy and India may have been prevented if such precautions had been taken there.

Grey-green, olive green, blue-green, yellow-green and deep green all look dramatic together and can form sophisticated combinations.

I learned everything about the game. After that I said, “I’m never gambling again.” Because the house always wins.

What story has withstood the test of time better than Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure Island"? This exotic coming-of-age parable has thrilled readers for nearly 130 years and been filmed dozens of times (counting the movies in various languages since around 1918 and many episodes of television series since the 1950s). Even with all that telling, the latest version of "Treasure Island," on Syfy this week, stands out as a gem—although some plot changes for the sake of agitprop make it a flawed one.
John Steinbeck has reason to smile, with classic film adaptations of "The Grapes of Wrath," "Of Mice and Men" and "East of Eden." The same could be said of Jane Austen and Dashiell Hammett. And the hit-and-miss Shakespeare lineup at least has its share of direct hits.

Howard County schools instituted in 2009 a policy against cyber-bullying, harassment and intimidation that calls for educators to take certain steps when bullying occurs on school property, at a school activity or event, or on a school bus.

The Answer: When you're small everyone is doing everything. As the company grew, there was more structure to it. With that came the ability to evaluate what everybody's expertise was.

They dominated the time of possession, 34:44 to 25:16, held the Gators to 99 yards rushing and just 212 yards of total offense. The angst is over the three fumbles Florida had.

Lea Antolini is an American Edith Piaf, a little sparrow with a big voice. When she sings that she’s “covered with scars,” she makes an audience see them. She offers a brave smile as she realizes that she’s “part of” Jamie’s success, while also letting us see that she needs more for herself, too. At least the odd structure does allow us to see Cathy become happier as the 90 minutes progress.
"Union Rags, on the other hand, has never had a break-out race like" Bodemeister, Battaglia said, adding of the Florida Derby and a second by a head in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile.

It's going to take some deep examination from Allen. It's going to take him spending some personal time around the organization again. Like Cameron, he must go alone. Allen must board that figurative submarine, seal himself inside, and be willing to face the realization that what's beneath the surface at One Center Court has probably been there for as long as he's owned the team.

This background helps explain why Americans spent nearly $2.6 trillion on health care in 2010 -- or about $8,400 per person, the federal government reported this month.

The central idea of the jobs package he described is quite different from the ideas he floated last month, when the governor first talked up the idea of adding a jobs bill to the work during this week's special session, which he convened for the purpose of adopting new congressional district maps. Originally, Mr. O'Malley was talking about increasing research and development and biotechnology tax credits — worthy ideas, perhaps, but not ones that would create jobs now. Those programs are designed to help fledgling companies in sectors in which the state has a great deal of long-term promise, but in the immediate term, the jobs they create number in the dozens, not the thousands.
