Jim Thome drew a one-out walk off Cahill, 1-8 since June 30. It was the 1,000th walk of Thome's career with the Indians, a franchise record. Santana cashed it in with a two-run homer to right. When Cahill hit Shelley Duncan with a pitch, he was done for the night.
"I love getting traded," said Cunningham last week while taking part in the team's winter development program at Progressive Field. Like Smith and the homer, Cunningham sees the trade as a chance to start anew.
Because there's barely agreement on the significance of witnessing a wedding, I'm comfortable declaring the significance of this "milestone in a couple's life" as firmly in the eye of the beholder. Many see housewarmings as just another excuse for a party.
(I should note here that employees have been paying the full cost of employer-provided benefits; their employer's share actually is part of the compensation paid in lieu of wages. The rise in employers' healthcare costs has kept wages from rising as fast they would have otherwise. But that's so abstract, most workers think of healthcare benefits as a freebie provided by their company, not something that comes at the expense of a higher salary.)

This much we know: For all intents and purposes, the city of St. Louis simply doesn't provide animal control services any more. All that's left of a once-vital division of the Health Department is a skeleton crew of trained animal control officers. They respond only to emergency situations such as reports of animal bites or severely aggressive dogs. The offending animals, if apprehended, wind up at the all-but-abandoned Animal Regulation Center on Gasconade Street for confinement, observation and, if necessary, euthanasia.

NEW YORK (AP) — Movie theaters in the next few weeks will be filled with stories about misbehaving pandas, heroic mutants, superheros with magic rings and a comedy of mistaken identity led by a man playing a woman. Typical summer fare, right? Well, not exactly when it comes to that comedy.

Oakland (11-12) intentionally walked Chris Davis, and that brought up Betemit. He blasted his first walk-off homer and gave the Orioles (14-8) the win that put them six games over .500 for the first time since July 20, 2005.
Q: We have a 12-year-old Arizona-sweet orange tree. Last year was the best crop we ever had, with the tree producing several hundred big, sweet oranges. This year, we have more than 400 oranges, but they are very small, baseball-size and even smaller. I water every 14 days and with four emitters set at 2 gallons an hour. I also fertilize two to three times per year. What am I doing wrong?

A few hours earlier, Gilles was at St. Mary, surrounded by a community dressed in the high school's colors -- black and red -- reminding each of its members that Chardon has been called to a hilltop of unbelievable grief, that everyone there is being asked to spread light, to be strong for others in the same way Demetrius' mother has been in her willingness to forgive, in the way her words have touched "an entire nation and beyond."
The playwright has a noble aim -- to reveal the untold story of the Buffalo Soldiers, African-American men dispatched to fight in the Philippines, who often found themselves at cross purposes with history. Barroga attempts to deconstruct a thorny tangle of issues, including race, colonialism and greed, in her ambitious epic. But the unwieldy narrative overreaches its grasp, and her passionate, compelling point of view on the plight of these soldiers and the people they were sent to subdue doesn't yet come through clearly enough in this world-premiere production.
Dexter said she was barbecuing at around 7 p.m. Saturday when she saw the Novellinos’ daughter in the street, "walking around in a daze, crying." She said she overheard the woman saying, "I told her to wait for me. Why didn’t she wait for me?"

Kevin Shattenkirk scored his first career playoff goal for the Blues, who were outscored 15-6 in the series to end their most successful season in more than a decade. Brian Elliott stopped 17 shots in an improved performance, but the Kings' momentum couldn't even be stopped by a bad game.
Yes, this one's our fault. Politicians and the media are fundamentally dumb beasts. One seeks votes, the other readers, but neither operates an inch above where they perceive the largest mass of their audience to be. And, for now, they've pegged us as salivating over backroom banter connecting hemoglobin to hysteria.
But for the sake of conversation and exploration here, let’s assume they’re telling the truth when they say they really were talking about a guy a round earlier, he was the highest-rated player left by far and they were shocked he was still available.

In Arizona and nationally, at least two-thirds of CPS investigations stem from neglect allegations, not abuse, and an equal percentage are classified as low or potential risk situations. In this vast gray area, any danger to children may not appear imminent, and the family's problems, as well as the potential for criminal charges, are harder to respond to.

Lincoln interrupted her, disagreeing. Her husband, he said, "should never have dragged the Negro into the war. It is a war from a great national object and the Negro has nothing to do with it."

In 1990, a group of Rwandan exiles, led by Kagame, invaded the country. They had grown up speaking English, mostly in Uganda and Tanzania, and the French saw them, according to historian Gerard Prunier, as part of "an obvious 'Anglo-Saxon' plot." Eager to defend its client regime, France trained and armed units that fought against Kagame's rebel force; other French-trained units helped carry out the 1994 genocide. Then, after the genocidal regime fell and Kagame's rebels came to power, French soldiers established a "Turquoise Zone" along the southwestern border, through which many accused genocidaires escaped to other countries. Several prominent ones settled in France.

Booth and Mulally said that paying off the company's debts and continuing to increase profits should help the company improve its credit rating.

Playa: Start things off at this smart, casual Latin restaurant from Rivera's John Sedlar with blue corn muffins and dreamy almond butter. Or maybe an order of tortillas florales (with edible flowers) and marmalade. More substantial fare includes duck hash with fingerlings, roasted peppers and an egg or huevos with polenta, lardons and rajas. Eggs benedict is made with Spanish jamón and chipotle bearnaise. But my favorite is the tamale made with cracked corn masa and pulled pork, topped with a sunny-side-up egg. For dessert, I love the goats milk ice cream with cornmeal cookies — or a cocktail from mixologist extraordinaire Julian Cox.

Killgore's message was disclosed at an arraignment for Louis Ray Perez, 45, who pleaded not guilty to murder. Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, the woman found at the motel, also has pleaded not guilty to murder.
Others might face new fees on brand-name drugs. In 2009, for the first time, Medicare officials are allowing insurers to penalize consumers who choose brand-name medicine over generic equivalents. The so-called product-selection penalty requires the consumer to pay the cost difference -- often hundreds of dollars per prescription. Only a few companies have imposed the fines (in Oregon, they include SilverScript Insurance Co. and Health Net's Orange plans), but those increases are easy to overlook.
While it is important to pay close attention to what your body is doing at the moment, it is just as important to know your family history. Everyone with a family history of heart disease should have a keen awareness of the warning signs and take immediate action if they appear.

In fact, there's no need to rehash the day in full detail. You know it all too well by now. How hit No. 3,000 was a home run. How Jeter went 5-for 5. And how his final knock of the day, an RBI single in the bottom of the eighth, was the game-winner.

Is this "Vladimir the balloon guy" after his big breakthrough? Or another Vladimir? Or maybe he's the same Vladimir in another dimension? This all gets clearer quickly -- to the extent that magic and metaphysical fiction can be -- when Vladimir gets his great trick to work, and each of the two magicians becomes a stranger in his own life. In part the ensuing complications offer a familiar moral about the corrosive power of wealth and fame. More importantly, they lead us to thoughts about the ways in which our notions of success, lifestyle and even identity itself can be illusory.

Yet, nine months on, Locke’s key role in the recent drama over blind legal activist Chen Guangcheng has put him on the front lines of U.S. concerns about China’s embattled dissident community. Chen’s sudden escape from house arrest and a U.S. decision to give him sanctuary in the U.S. Embassy gave Locke his first crisis as ambassador, made him a target of criticism from Beijing and earned him respect from the human rights lobby.

Interstate trips are manageable, but you won't want to make a regular habit of them. Either suspension -- there's a base setup in Pop and Lounge trims and a sport-tuned suspension in the 500 Sport -- settles into a firm up-and-down rhythm on the highway. The car's short, 90.6-inch wheelbase doesn't handle expansion joints and other ruts gracefully, and the semi-independent rear suspension doesn't help. Ever-present road and wind noise add to the ruckus, and the optional moonroof's mesh sunscreen doesn't block out any sound. It's worth mentioning that the Cooper and Cooper S ride firmly -- objectionably so, with their optional Sport packages -- so the 500 is no outlier here.

She told Zooeymagazine: ''Interestingly enough, I don't really care about my teeth, but I think any woman on this planet could say, 'I wish my ass was smaller, my arms were thinner and I had green eyes not brown.' I think anyone is as critical as they have the energy to self-obsess, but I also know as an actress you are more limited if you interfere with your looks. If you have a whole bunch of work done with your teeth and your face and your boobs then you're only going to play modern people. That's a big choice to make. Very limiting.''

Snooki, Snooki, Snooki. MTV's "Jersey Shore" castmate transformed from sloppy, slutty drunk to acrobatic party girl to tragic figure in the course of one episode. MTV indeed faded to black just before Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi took a fist to the face from a drunken Benny, and it was no laughing matter.

To be honest, I do not know why I care so much. Perhaps it's because I adore you and I think you're all that, and I want to invite you to investigate all these delightful cultural atrocities right along with me.

One way to protect yourself: Have lots of good sex now (or when convenient). Not only will you be giving your partner, if you have one, extra incentive to stick around, you'll be building a buffer around your libido.

Q. It has been bothering me how you painted such a pretty picture when writing about the issue of English Language Learners in today's classroom.

You must know. Painting a pretty picture in a storm is not always the best way to see your way through it. How do we fix it, not make it seem like it is all puppies and roses in today's classroom?

Nashville, TN (Sports Network) - Pekka Rinne picked a good time for his first playoff shutout. The Vezina Trophy candidate posted 32 saves to help the Nashville Predators take a 2-0 win over the Phoenix Coyotes in Game 3 of this Western Conference semifinal series from Bridgestone Arena on Wednesday night. Nashville had dropped the first two games of this best-of-seven series in Phoenix, but the home crowd helped it get back into the series thanks to Rinne's shutout and goals from David Legwand and Mike Fisher 66 seconds apart in the first period. The Predators grabbed the win without forwards Alexander Radulov and Andrei Kostitsyn, who were both suspended by the team for this game on Tuesday after violating team rules. Mike Smith was touched for both goals on 26 shots for the Coyotes, who had won all three road games in their opening-round series against Chicago. Game 4 will be played on Friday night in Nashville.

May 12, 2010: Portland police Officer Christopher Burley, 31, was shot during a traffic stop in the Lloyd District. Officers thought Keaton Otis, 25, seemed suspicious because he was wearing a hoodie on a warm day and driving a Toyota Corolla that didn't "fit" him. They stopped him for failing to signal when changing lanes and for not pulling over right away. Otis yelled profanities, appeared unfazed by Taser shots and grabbed a 9 mm pistol from his glove box, firing two shots and striking Burley in the groin. Three other officers shot Otis 23 times, killing him. Otis had struggled with mental illness and was off his medication, family members said. Burley recovered and now is the Police Bureau's mobile crisis unit officer, working with people who suffer from mental illness and come into frequent contact with police.

ø"I'm sure there will be some healthy competition on the field in the next few years," Tannehill said. "But right now we're just excited for each other."
In "War of the Worlds," the aliens initially are mistaken for terrorists. The film is, I suppose, Spielberg's post-9/11 movie, but even without 9/11, he might eventually have made his way to this scorched terrain. "A.I.," which was made four years earlier, is about a robot boy who yearns to be human to win back the love of the flesh-and-blood mother who abandoned him, and for most of the way it's frighteningly creepy. "Minority Report," about a future in which cops, guided by all-seeing "pre-cogs," arrest killers before their crimes are committed, is a ghastly fusion of sci-fi and noir.
Ethereal to the tongue, bright and pleasing to the eye, the dainty Parisian pastries known as macarons are tiny bites of luxury.

"I don't care what neighborhood you're in. You don't feel safe in your house; you don't feel safe out of your house. You're scared to come back home. ... It's ridiculous. If I could get away from here, I would get away from here in a heartbeat."
With Hosni Mubarak gone, activists will now have to contend with hard-core politics in a way that has been missing from Egypt's Potemkin parliament. Controversial legislation, like the equal right to divorce that was passed in 2000, will come under pressure from Islamist lawmakers who fiercely opposed the bill. (Tunisia is the only other Arab country that grants women the right.) Women's groups can no longer fall back upon a sympathetic Mubarak regime, which often sided with their cause.
Council members urged residents to look to the borough’s website for instructions on how to fill out Federal Emergency Management Association applications for damage to individuals.

Then the panel suggested landing on a near-Earth asteroid, followed by flights to and around Mars and landing on a Martian moon. The panel also noted that landing on Earth's moon is "an obvious alternative" to Mars, maybe after an asteroid mission and serving as a possible training stop for other flights. The space agency also might still opt to go to the moon before anywhere else, NASA's Garver said.

* The district's evaluation of teachers does not take into account whether students are learning. Principals are not required to consider testing data, student work or grades. L.A.

The NRC utilizes a combination of color-coded inspection findings and performance indicators to gauge plant performance. The colors start with “green,” representing very low safety significance, to “white,” “yellow” or “red,” commensurate with the significance of the issues involved. The agency issues reviews of performance at specific plants twice a year. Inspection findings and performance indicators are also updated on the NRC’s Web site, www.nrc.gov , each quarter. Following the release of the annual assessment letters every March, the NRC meets with the public in the vicinity of each plant to discuss the results. The meetings are in keeping with the agency’s commitment to transparency with regard to its activities.
He had spent the night of Jan. 30, 2008, at O'Brien's home in the Lake Hopatcong section of Jefferson because he was friends with one her sons. According to an arrest affidavit, Diaz-Bridges told investigators he and O'Brien argued after her teenage sons left for school. He pushed O'Brien and she fell backward, hit her head on a coffee table and lost consciousness, the affidavit said. As she seemed to regain consciousness, Diaz-Bridges picked up a dumbbell and struck her in the head repeatedly, then checked her pulse and found she was dead, the affidavit said. He left her body in a closet, according to authorities.
I've never seen this on a Christmas compilation (unless you count that dB'sChristmas record), but I don't know why. The melody's sweeter than Santa-shaped chocolate, the vocals are soulful and joyous, and - get this - the lyrics are actually about the birth of Jesus. Alex Chilton sets the stage with "Angels from the realms of glory, stars shone bright above, Royal David city was bathed in light of love." Then, the chorus hits and cuts right to the chase. "Jesus Christ was born today. Jesus Christ was born." And is that really tympani? I think that's tympani. How Christmas can you get?

Animated Shorts: The shorts were so short that this package includes five extra films. The nominated ones are "Presto," the very cute magician-and-rabbit cartoon from Pixar that was attached to "WALL-E" last year; "Lavatory-Lovestory" (a weird little concoction from Russia); "Oktapadi" (at 3 minutes, the shortest short); "This Way Up" from Britain (about two bungling undertakers); and "La Maison En Petits Cubes" from Japan (a touching film about memory and loss that looks like a wet painting).
Pacific overlook: At 1,850 feet, Rocky Ridge at Garrapata State Park towers over the Pacific Ocean. As you gaze out miles to the blue horizon, it feels like you can sense the curvature of the Earth.

The solution: Most folks need deodorants, not antiperspirants. But if you really suffer, try a boric acid or tannic acid solution. Still dripping? Put on 20 percent aluminum chloride at night, and wash it off in the morning. Or try antibiotic creams to kill multiplying bacteria. Hyperhidrosis? Botox turns off the faucet. Beta-blockers (medicine for high blood pressure) relieve chronic, stress-related sweating.
The REAL solution is federal immigration reform.

The Transportation Department hasn't made a decision on the extension yet. But some believe that regardless of how it rules, the government needs to do more. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., is pushing for even more disclosure from airlines.

Positive publicity? East Side has gotten plenty in football, including on Dec. 3, 2008, after the Flyers gained the 7A state title, when this corner credited Sunkett for debunking the fans who had moaned at some of his game strategy. From my vantage point, I found the head coach above criticism, especially in a 35-28 quarterfinal victory over Chicago St. Rita, which had led 28-7 in the third quarter.

Waldman, a former New York Times reporter, said she first thought of the book in 2003 and began working on it four years later. Reality scooped her in 2010 when plans for an Islamic community center near the World Trade Center — the so-called "ground zero mosque" — led to the kind of public argument she had been thinking up in private.
David Freese had a two-run single for the Cardinals and Rafael Furcal had three hits to support Lohse (3-0).

Young once falsely claimed paternity of the child Edwards fathered with his then-mistress Rielle Hunter in 2007. The former aide is potentially the government's most important witness as prosecutors seek to prove the then-married Democratic candidate masterminded a scheme to use nearly $1 million provided by two wealthy campaign donors to help hide his pregnant mistress as he sought the White House in 2008.
Each has its own tax rates and mix of revenue from property taxes, sales taxes and state funding. And those factors have combined for losses for a few regional districts. The Ladue and Lindbergh districts, for example, have experienced revenue reductions of more than 10 percent per student since 2007-08.
“I just don’t know how it happened. He’s strong enough to pull himself out of that water,” Lynetta Moore, Weathers’ personal trainer, told WFAA. “I don’t know if he was trampled, tangled, but it doesn’t make sense.

What we did — Because we were there to see my cousins, we spent several hours on Saturday and Sunday with my family, but that doesn't mean we didn't have time for other things, such as lounging on the beach or at the pool, frou frou drink in hand. We also went on a two-hour dolphin cruise with the Southern Star ($29 adults; southernstardolphincruise.com). We saw dolphins leaping from the water, surfacing very near the boat in groups of as many as five. We also tried our hand at the WaveRunner, which was a great idea in theory but it didn't work out so well for us. Once we got past the no wake signs, we kicked the WaveRunner in gear and went … nowhere. Our WaveRunner wouldn't go past 6 mph. I can run faster than that. We decided to make the best of it and visit Crab Island, a sandbar on the north side of the Destin bridge where boats anchor and people walk around in water that was 2 feet deep while we were there. This is where the locals anchor to spend the day swimming, snorkeling, bouncing on a water trampoline and even playing football. When we returned the WaveRunner we told the folks at Boogie Sports about it, they pulled seaweed from the bottom (they had warned us about seaweed but said the WaveRunner would beep if there were a problem) and shrugged.
Therefore, while Hubby was able to move furniture out, lay down drop cloths, strip off wallpaper, remove vent covers and switch plates and disconnect electronics, in those same few hours I was removing VHS tapes from our movie library and agonizing over each one: ah, here was our son's favorite Disney movie he watched so many times he had the dialogue memorized. And this was the first romantic comedy our daughter and I watched together when she was still a pre-teen experiencing her first crush and wondering if real love was like in the film we were watching.

The recession hit Hispanic families harder than it did other racial groups. What these families want to hear is how you are going to put America back to work and safeguard its economic stability. They want to hear what you will do to make their schools better so their children can raise the family’s economic prospects, as previous generations did. You might mention that a prosperous and well-educated Latino demographic is imperative for the nation’s future, considering its burgeoning size.
I think the team that will burn out will be Washington. The Redskins are 3-1 and lead the NFC East, but I don't see them having the kind of talent required to win what is always the most physical division in the NFL.

She got (offered) jobs in Cape Cod, California and St. Louis. Part of the reason I wanted to be here was the river. I said no to Cape Cod and California.
Food is an adventure, but sometimes it's OK to eat something familiar. I was quite surprised that the kids were willing to try so many new foods, especially Callie, whose diet usually consists of bread and pasta and rice. Tomatoes tasted better in Spain, and new varieties of olives and melon became favorites. Zeke discovered new ways to eat eggs, and you could order jamón and it would never be the same thing twice.
Presentation: A salad of mixed field greens, baguette slices spread with herb butter and a fruity pinot grigio are nice accompaniments.
La Calaca’s menu shares some dishes with its suburban cousin, which isn’t a bad thing. The superb fillet of grilled black bass, bending over creamy rice studded with sweet crab and the warmth of poblano peppers, is one of my favorite fish entrées anywhere. The hearty nachos, meticulously layered with guajillo-braised short ribs, silky black beans, roasted corn, and the tang of house-pickled jalapeños, are a masterwork of tortilla architecture. And yes, there is the obligatory guacamole. But this rendition, mashed to order with onion-jalapeno paste in a lava rock molcajete, may be my favorite in the city, at once fluffy but still rustic with a few bumps, and a creamy savor that takes on another dimension when blended with the subtle sweet pop of the optional diced fruit. The “elotes locos,” corn on the cob glazed with lime mayo then dusted with queso fresco and powdered chil, is as addictive as ever.

The couple tightened up their home's energy efficiency by improving insulation, testing for air leaks and increasing the efficiency of their oil furnace and home appliances, so the photovoltaic system is expected to cover about half the electricity they use per year, Don Baack said. The system cost about $12,500 upfront, but their federal and state tax credits add up to more than $9,500 during the next four years, bringing the final to slightly more than $2,500, he said.
Dr. Laura Kruper, an assistant professor and cancer surgeon at City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., cautioned that the study doesn't allow any conclusions to be made about how stress is connected to more aggressive tumors. "To clearly show an association between higher stress levels and aggressiveness of breast cancer, patients would have to be followed for many years prior to diagnosis to see if patients with higher levels of stress developed more aggressive forms of cancer," she said.

"The Situation" ends up in the hot tub with Snooki, Ryder, Vinnie, Paulie and a random girl. Snooki and Ryder start making out rather sloppily -- "I had a feeling where I wanted to make out with somebody," Snooki says, "so I just started making out with Ryder because all the guys like that." Oh Lord, would someone buy this girl an ounce of self-respect. Snooki then moves on to Mike, who is receptive.
The unusual bone breaks — called atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures — were first documented in small clinical reports and through the FDA's MedWatch system, which monitors side effects of drugs after they've been approved. Such reports do not necessarily mean the drug is the cause of the problem, but multiple reports of the same side effect with the same drug can spur additional investigation. Other potential side effects of bisphosphonate drugs have been identified through the FDA's reporting system, including serious jaw deterioration and esophageal cancer.
The Ohio Automobile Dealers Association, in fact, plans to honor Sutton as well as Bainbridge Township Republican Steve LaTourette, at its annual convention this weekend at the Greenbriar, a West Virginia resort, according to Sutton's office.

And overall, the restaurant scene seems to be emerging from its recessionary lows. Private fast-food and fast casual companies have seen sales rise 5.69% in the last 12 months after growing 5.18% in 2011, according to financial analysis firm Sageworks Inc. The segment’s sales hit its lowest growth rate of 0.78% in 2009.

McCain -- in back-to-back speeches delivered on the day he formally created his presidential exploratory committee -- portrayed the election result as deserved punishment of Republicans for their performance in office, rather than an affirmation of the Democratic Party.

In other words, it looks like Americans have an issue not just with production, but also consumption. Given that it takes about a decade for a newly leased area to start producing barrels of crude, a president won’t make much of a difference in U.S. energy supplies in the short term by opening more lands for drilling. A more promising route toward energy independence in the near term is by boosting conservation and energy efficiency. Of course, there’s been a lot of progress on that front already. Quoting Margonelli again: “Since 1973, the U.S. has met 75% of our new energy needs through energy efficiency, a profound change in economic productivity that has saved us money, pollution, and avoided environmental and political risk.”

In the years since, the courts have changed the system for the better. Buyers faced with thousands in unanticipated costs due to needed repairs turned to the courts for relief. Today, well-established legal precedents exist that subject sellers, who fail to disclose defects in their homes that they are aware of, to potential civil liabilities through the courts. Also, today all Realtors have a legal and ethical responsibility to disclose all pertinent facts they know about a property. In an effort to comply with the law and serve our customers better, Realtors in our area and throughout the country began to utilize the sellers' disclosure form.

African-Americans, workers, consumers and environmentalists don't fare much better in Bork's America. For instance, he supports the constitutionality of literacy tests and poll taxes in state elections — those notorious instruments the South used to keep blacks from voting. Imagine how easily Bork's acolytes would green-light the passel of laws passed in Republican-controlled states to tamp down minority voting. Florida's law imposing high bureaucratic hurdles and punishing fines on groups collecting voter registrations wouldn't cause a flicker of concern.
Golden acknowledged Sunday in an email that working on relationships with NFL teams is not new.

Well, the taxpayers are stuck for 2010 (I did not and will not vote for a 9% tax increase for this worst-of-all-budgets in four years) but I do want to express gratitude to the police officers, their union and their leadership for their willingness to prevent layoffs and continue to safeguard the town. Unfortunately, they were stiff-armed with threats that were not necessary because there were other tough alternatives for decreasing costs. Also one of the layoffs in the sewer plant is still active (the crucial licensed back-up operator that could prevent a $50,000 state fine).

For our global celebration of spring, we couldn't help but think pink and pastel. And to really set the tone for a proper Mar-Tea-Ni party masses of carnations became a nod to English topiary. Pink table runners that you can make yourself served as decor and place mats, too. To do this at home, simply cut fabric to your desired length, allowing for a 1-inch border on each side. Tuck an inch of the fabric under on each side, and iron it to make a crisp fold. Then iron again with Stitch Witchery, which fuses the fabric together and creates a no-sew seam.

About 22,000 Minnesotans live under the authority of court-appointed guardians and conservators, and about 3,000 new cases are added each year.

The problem -- mostly due to longer and mandatory sentences combined with an idiotic war on drugs -- is so abysmal that the Supreme Court recently ordered 33,000 prisoners in California to be housed elsewhere or released. If California could simply return to its 1970 level of incarceration, the savings from its $9 billion prison budget would cut the state's budget deficit in half. But doing so would require the release of 125,000 inmates, and not even the most progressive reformer has a plan to reduce the prison population by 85 percent.

Matt Kamalsky, DraftExpress.com: "Slightly undersized, limited offensively, and inexperienced defensively, Faried has a fair share of question marks. However, he has a clear NBA-level skill, and the type of motor coaches dream of, which can't be said for every prospect. Expecting him to come in and emerge as a major impact player early in his career is a stretch, but Faried certainly seems to have the tools to fill a Louis Amundson-type role for a team looking for a workhorse to infuse their team with energy off the bench. If he works on his weaknesses and adapts to the professional game, Faried could live up to the lofty expectations he's set for himself with his outstanding college career."

The Russian taste for Champagne has been legendary since the armies chasing Napoleon occupied Reims and Epernay in 1814. In 1876, Louis Roederer, hearing of Czar Alexander II's love of the fizz, commissioned a special clear bottle and created Cristal. Catering to the sweet "gout rousse," Champagne houses left far more sugar in bottles destined for Russia. Later, in the Soviet era, with crippling import tariffs, the state chose to produce its own knockoffs from primarily Ukrainian or Georgian grapes. With the fall of Communism, Western fizz returned but the thirst for Shampanskoe hardly slaked. Now private firms now churn out surprisingly decent semisweet sparkling wine that can be found on these shores for about $10. Surprisingly, it's easier to find than English bubbly.

Places where there are still unanswered questions: We still give, what, $3.11 per capita as a region to the arts compared to Seattle, which is $7.50 and Denver, which is $15. So in terms of overall commitment, there are real questions to be answered. There is more we can do in terms of diversity and equity, economically, racially and geographically. We've done a good job of telling the Portland story but keep in mind that we also have a powerful story to tell in terms of local bands, filmmakers and writers. One of those important things that the mayor and city can do is not only what dollars we spend on arts but how we can get art to be part of how we think about decisions and get it into our cultural decision making. And I don't mean cultural in the same respect but kind of in the operating habit of the various institutions of our city, private and public. I think doing that, for instance, probably helped a little bit in Fernwood having the Beverly Cleary School and knowing there are ways the public can tell a story about how this place is important artistically that can feed the philanthropic community, that can feed our economic investment. Those are some thoughts.
