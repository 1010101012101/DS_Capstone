Back to that snappy line from Palin's big speech. Of course, terrorism and its perpetrators are a threat that must be confronted. Of course, Obama would be guilty of weak-kneed excess if he placed more emphasis on protecting al-Qaida terrorists' rights than the lives of their would-be victims. But Obama and like-minded torture opponents advocate nothing of the sort. The concern is for innocent detainees, too many of whom have been locked up and abused without access to due process, and for the corrosive effect of torture on cherished American principles.

(La Russa) said, ‘Mark, you are more of a psychologist than you are a hitting coach.' And that's so true. One of the things that has really helped me out is ... how much of this game is mental. I knew the mental side of this thing. That's one thing that I've tried to preach to the hitters this year."

As good as Priory is, there are some lingering questions. Chief among them is whether or not the Rebels can come back from a deficit. Priory has never trailed this season. When the playoffs come around everything tightens up, even the players. If the Rebels do allow a goal, or dare I say two goals, how will they react?
Chaillé isn't a charismatic figure craving the public spotlight.

Theater conservatives objected as well. Avoiding overt religious content in musicals so as not to limit audience appeal had long been a Broadway article of faith. "The Sound of Music" and "Fiddler on the Roof" may have tested the waters, but shows that failed to suppress important religious references in the material they converted into musicals rarely became hits. In "Carousel," for example, Julie mourns her lover to the strains of "You'll Never Walk Alone;" in "Liliom," the play on which the musical is based, she reads from the Beatitudes of St. Matthew. Similarly, in "Guys and Dolls," the line "call it dumb, call it clever" in the title song is as close as an audience gets to the heart of the show as revealed in its literary source, the Damon Runyon story in which a love-struck gambler makes his case directly by citing St. Paul: "Let him become a fool, that he may be wise."

4. If Deshaun Thomas keeps scoring (49 points) and rebounding (19 rebounds in Pittsburgh), he is gone to the NBA. That's just a gut feeling. He seems more equipped to play the small forward spot in the pros than Sullinger, a classic 'tweener, does the power forward spot, frankly.

Yes, it’s gone double platinum. But “Saints” is now treated like an ugly cousin to “Graceland,” and that’s unfair.

Simon has always been attracted to soundscapes, and “Saints” is his bravest journey into the musical ether. And when he gets down to storytelling — as in “The Cool, Cool River” — he demonstrates how much his travels have broadened his scope.

This is not a time or place for "Occupy Rams Park" manifestos, either. This matter requires some deep thought and intelligent conversation. I make no apologies for where I stand.

After Alabama passed its law, farm workers left for other states and crops were ruined. When Arizona gained a reputation for discrimination after passing its law, the state lost an estimated $145 million in convention business. When teachers in Alabama were forced to become immigration agents, students were afraid to attend school. When cops are required to check immigration papers, they spend less time solving serious crimes. When states sanction profiling, U.S. citizens and immigrants alike get stopped and harassed. We must do better than SB 1070 - the Supreme Court must strike it down.

In the library, Faulkner's pipe sat in an ashtray next to his reading chair; his glasses lay open on a desk. In the office, built in the 1950s, his notes for the novel "A Fable" remained as he had left them, inscribed in graphite and red grease pencil on the walls. By the front door hung two maps of Yoknapatawpha County, one from the 1936 novel "Absalom, Absalom!" (signed "William Faulkner, Sole Owner and Proprietor") and the other from "The Portable Faulkner." I knew these maps, but looking at them now, it was as though I had never quite seen them, as if I had misunderstood their economies of scale.

The DFL dilemma did not go unnoticed by Republicans.
We have seen many in this chamber work tirelessly for the better part of this year to offer thoughtful ideas about how to achieve reform. Of the five committees asked to develop bills, four have completed their work, and the Senate Finance Committee announced today that it will move forward next week. That has never happened before. Our overall efforts have been supported by an unprecedented coalition of doctors and nurses; hospitals, seniors' groups and even drug companies -- many of whom opposed reform in the past. And there is agreement in this chamber on about eighty percent of what needs to be done, putting us closer to the goal of reform than we have ever been.

As recession washed over the economy, the space stood empty until restaurant vet Todd Steele -- in Portland via San Francisco and McMinnville -- saw its potential. He envisioned an establishment where food and wine would coexist in equilibrium.

His bigger challenge was finding a chef who understood and could execute his culinary vision.

On our first morning we stroll to get the lay of the land. The Slovak National Gallery seems like a must-do — surely its exhibits will help us better understand the city and country. We are two of only four or five visitors — and the guards look at us with suspicion — or was that annoyance? — each time we open the door to a different gallery. The permanent collections feature Gothic, religious and Slovakian art we don't find appealing. Instead, we find ourselves drawn to an exhibition of whimsical works by Baroness Margita Czobelova, a Slovakian illustrator and painter.

It is telling that the best tracks on “Strange Clouds” are the four B.o.B produced himself. It’s here, and on the earnest “So Hard to Breathe,” that he allows himself to stretch out and get ruminative. (They’re also the closest the album comes to the dramatic art-pop he’s not-so-secretly longing to make.) It’s on one of these songs, the excellent “Ray Bands,” that B.o.B announces his intention to follow up “Strange Clouds” with a rock album. That figures: B.o.B, who plays many of the instruments on “Strange Clouds,” is a people-pleaser and a show-off. Despite all the record sales, he’s still hungry to show the world how much he can do.

A: Your Armenian cucumber is actually a melon, not a cucumber, and it sounds as if your plants are not being pollinated. The flowers of melons, cucumbers and squash have separate male and female flowers. If the flowers open, and a female flower does not get pollinated, the small undeveloped fruit behind the flower will abort. Lack of pollination can be the result of not having male and female flowers present on the same morning, or if both are present, you do not have any pollinators (usually bees) working that morning.

Getting the required 24 of 32 owners to agree on anything can be difficult, let alone something as complex as a new collective bargaining agreement. And there has been enough pushback from owners familiar with those proposals that progress made recently might not lead to an agreement in the next few weeks.
The people hanging out — and there was a pretty good crowd on a Wednesday night — were still tired travelers relaxing. They ordered Natty Boh on draft and marveled at the immaculate bathrooms. They didn't sit in leather chairs stroking a glass of whiskey. It might become that sort of a place, but for now it's about as exclusive as Bond Street Social in Fells Point.

But again, there were moments too when technical polish was in short supply. The finale of the Shostakovich - a breathless romp with darting allusions to favorite pieces of Mozart and Rossini - sounded vigorous and charming but not always steady on its feet.

One is Medicaid. There are more young Ohioans enrolled in Medicaid than there are older Ohioans. But end-of-life care costs a lot more than care for newborns. According to the state budget office, elderly, blind or disabled Ohioans accounted for 24 of every 100 Medicaid clients in Ohio in 2008, but their care required 67 cents of every $1 Medicaid spent. And 2008 census data say 13.7 percent of all Ohioans are 65 or older. The national average is 12.8 percent.
Mary Lou Bradley raises bulls in the Texas Panhandle town of Memphis to sell to ranchers for breeding. She spent more than $100,000 on hay to keep her animals fed during the drought, which is still gripping her area, and now she's looking for new markets.

For me, writing something always makes it more real, more concrete. In the past, I've mentally noted things I am grateful for. I need to list them on paper once or twice a week. First on my list will be a thank-you to my body for being responsive to good nutrition and regular exercise. Having abused it for many years, I am deeply appreciative of the good health I enjoy today.

I've changed my mind. There are simply too many abuses going on in too many shelters, and too many of them are going unpunished or even uninvestigated.

The reason, according to Seton Hall’s players, was that the Texas Tech center had elbowed Pope in the back of the head early in the game.

Spotlight on Andrew Bynum: You know him, right? The guy who swatted away shot after shot Sunday afternoon? Yeah, that Andrew Bynum. The interesting thing is there remains a healthy amount of still-getting-to-know-you going on around Lakers camp. Bynum, his teammates and coach Mike Brown were all peppered with queries trying to understand the 7-footer's state of mind. Each party pretty much laughed off all the questions. It does, however, underscore Bynum's continuing role as an enigma. You think you have a handle on him, and then you don't. But one thing the Lakers absolutely know right now is the 24-year-old is playing the best basketball of his career.

David Chang and Peter Meehan take pride in the dark worldview they share. "We're always trying to see whose glass is more empty," says Chang, the New York chef who's made a name out of fusing high and low, to fantastic results. "Joy is not part of the equation," agrees Meehan, a food writer known for his gruff wit. Despite their dedicated stance against optimism, however, they both love to get people excited about food. And if you get them talking about their new food journal, "Lucky Peach," you catch glimpses of unbridled enthusiasm.

The first step, once the police negotiate community support, is to identify all the dealers and make cases against them. Then comes the surprising part: Instead of being arrested, the nonviolent dealers are called in for a meeting. (The handful of violent ones go to jail.) They are presented with the evidence against them—perhaps video of them making a sale—and confronted by angry neighbors, clergy and relatives. Each one is then offered a choice: Stop dealing and get help to turn your life around, or tell it to the judge.

We wanted the full experience. A diverse group — Al and Jack, retired businessmen; Davis, a gallery owner; Daniel, an artist, and me, a writer. We were linked by our enjoyment of the outdoors, by our ages — mid- to late-60s — and by a desire to defy frailty of one sort or another. We figured we would be ready for Yosemite after months of hiking in the mountains of northern New Mexico where we all live. By departure time, we had convinced ourselves that we'd overtrained and began studying maps of Yosemite to see how we might extend each day's hike. Our wives listened quietly. If any of them were thinking, "No fools like old fools," they kept it to themselves.
Fans of Suzanne Collins' best-selling young adult novel should be thoroughly satisfied with the faithfulness of Gary Ross' film adaptation, though the book's brutal violence has been softened to earn the movie a PG-13 rating. Jennifer Lawrence ("Winter's Bone") is an ideal choice to play strong, independent teen heroine Katniss Everdeen, who is thrust into the middle of the annual Hunger Games, a brutal, fight-to-the-death competition involving teenage girls and boys in a post-apocalyptic North America. (Similarities to reality shows like "Survivor" and "American Idol" are clearly intended.) Ross maintains a sense of tension and immersion in this dystopian world as competitors drop off one by one, and though it runs nearly 2 1/2 hours, "The Hunger Games" never drags. Rated PG-13; violent themes, disturbing images. 2 hours, 22 minutes. By Christy Lemire.
