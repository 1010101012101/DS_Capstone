Defense used to be 60% of the budget. When I was born, it was 60% of the budget. It's now 17% of the budget. Those who believe that defense is causing the budget problems simply don't know the math. The math is that when I was born, entitlements were less than 10% of the budget. That is the area of growth, and entitlements will completely consume all revenues in just a handful of years. Because why? Because most of the entitlements, unfortunately, are targeted toward those in the margins of life, which happen to be the disabled, but more particularly the elderly. And we see the baby boom generation beginning to retire, and all bets are off as to whether we'll be able to afford this explosion of benefits.

• As his role with Trail Blazers has evolved, LaMarcus Aldridge has found his game -- Anne Peterson, Associated Press: Denver coach George Karl is a vocal fan of the Blazers' 6-foot-11 star, and Cleveland Cavaliers coach Byron Scott heaps on the praise. "The thing that impresses me is how hard he plays," Scott said before a game against the Blazers this season. "He's so long and athletic. He can do it on the post, and he can do it on the perimeter. He runs that floor as well as any big man in this league, and he's a very unselfish, young, talented basketball player."
"The Urban Pirates was actually started in 2008 by two Baltimore moms [Lauren and Cara], who both have kids all under the age of 10. I was their neighbor, and I've worked for Nickelodeon in New York, so I have a background in children's entertainment. It seemed like a perfect fit, so I stepped in to guide them to develop a kid-friendly program. The program is designed for an age group of 3 to 10 ten years old, but we do family and adult cruises. We teach everyone how to talk, sing and dance like a pirate — we teach them how to be a part of our crew."

Furthermore, the average Zambian citizen can carry more on their heads, their backs and their bicycles than we can stash in our SUV trunks. I don't know where they were all going, but the roads we traveled on were busy with pedestrians and bicyclists at all hours of the day. A simple toot of the horn warned them to move over. They'd probably shake their heads in confusion if they heard about our local motorist versus bicyclist issues.
Elliott is a big reason the Blues have come this far. He's going to have to be a main reason for them to go farther.
Rated: PG for language and some sensuality.
And then: the finale, opening with that marvelous Recitative, with boldly operatic declamations from the cellos and basses. They later began whispering the "Ode to Joy" theme, as the bassoons and warmly glowing violas joined in, then the violins: tides upon tides, building with confidence straight up to the entrance of the chorus. It sang Schiller's words with beer-garden exuberance, yet managed to pay attention to Beethoven's shimmering sounds of the firmament.
That history helps explain why last Thursday's gathering of auto industry executives and engineers was so unusual -- and potentially so important to the future of Glenn and this region.
If only I'd thought to bring along a heart-rate monitor, to synch with the on-board cycling computer. Fortunately, I was able to follow Molter's directions, based on heart-rate figures, using other data such as wattage, revolutions per minute, and level of perceived exertion.

Everything is there for Detroit to become one of the best teams in the league and serious Super Bowl contender. But if penalties and boneheaded plays continue to be an issue, this nucleus will be wasted. The Lions were third in the league in penalties committed last year, with 7.9 a game. Jim Schwartz is a terrific coach, but a total firebrand. If Schwartz dials it back, it might trickle down and make his team better.

In other words, even the proximity to Harvard's elite ruling class couldn't prepare Duncan for the likes of Simon Roth, a real estate mogul whose wealth and reach have the associate feeling like his nose is pressed to the glass of a rarified strata he can never belong to. And yet Roth's daughter Leah takes more than a passing interest in Duncan, despite differences of class — the American divide still trapped in the closet, unlike race, gender and sexual orientation — and financial rank, for reasons that start out intriguing, turn murky and eventually dangerous.
The titillating tidbits aside, Alford's book should lead us to ask important questions about those we elect: How does a politician's morality affect his fitness for office? Are recklessness and self-indulgence disqualifiers? And is it too much to ask a leader to be honest, decent and true to his wedding vows?

It certainly doesn't help that one of Jacobs' newly hired policy advisors is former sports-bashing Sentinel columnist Mike Thomas. Remember what Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer once said of Thomas and his philosophy on spending for capital improvements? "If Thomas were running the city," Dyer said, "we'd still be driving on dirt roads."
The food has its arresting moments. A plate of baked stuffed dates is a high point. Stuffed with almonds and blue cheese and wrapped with prosciutto, the dates arrive warm, sweetened by a honey-pomegranate syrup. It's a perfect, wholly considered dish from start to finish, and the dates deliver a punch of flavor. Topped with tender butter-poached lobster and flavored with brandy, the papardelle plate is another winner, layering the thick ribbon-y pasta with roasted leeks, sweet peas and forest mushrooms.

Avril, who had 11 sacks and six forced fumbles last year, did not take part in the Lions' off-season conditioning program Monday or Tuesday. He and the Lions have been unable to agree on a long-term contract since the team slapped him with its franchise tag before the start of free agency.

The trail meets Christopher Creek's coppery bed early in the hike, forcing a rock hop to get across. After a rainstorm, the creek's peaceful gurgle turns into a muddy rage, which may interfere with safe crossings. Just beyond the creek, the trail enters a flourishing meadow crowded with wildflowers. Old ponderosas saturate the air with their sweetness. These first two miles make an easy hike with reasonable grades. Then the trail starts to climb.

It happened on a chilly autumn night at Game 5 of the 2000 World Series at Shea Stadium in Queens, of all places. There in the home of the team he always most wanted to beat, not only in head-to-head competition but even more in attendance figures, George Steinbrenner turned and faced the third-base stands that held the last of the Yankees fans after the game and waved to them from among the media on the field.

You find yourself saying, "Uh, did they really just set that room on fire? Did he just crawl under a moving truck? Are those real snakes?

He has a lot of quirky sayings, but he's able to let you know why they work, or why what he's telling you works. He's fun to be around. He'll talk with us before games, talk to us during games. I've enjoyed learning what he did as a pitcher. I looked at some of his tapes, and I watched and though, 'This is how I want to pitch.' His mechanics seem familiar to me, the way he pitches is the way I want to pitch. It's the way I've got to pitch. He mixed all of his pitches in to be successful, and to be successful I have to mix all of my pitches in.

Still, “The Machine” of moving planks that dominated Lepage’s stage morphed into several eye-catching and unlikely formations. The trees of the forest in Act I had an impressive, rounded-out look courtesy of video image artist Boris Firquet and the snowy mountain and ring of fire that close the opera were artfully rendered.

Henry's fondness for his glove "Zero" and his worn Cardinals hat are mentioned throughout the book. The reason he became a Cardinal fan is the same reason he became a shortstop. It's because of the aforementioned Aparicio - the Cardinals sublime shortstop, Aparicio Rodriguez. Harbach's Rodriguez played 18 years for the Cardinals. He set a college record for consecutive games without an error, a record that Skrimshander is poised to break. Rodriguez's No. 3 is retired by the Cardinals. His first name is all the introduction he needs. Does all of this sound familiar? A Cardinals shortstop who becomes a Hall of Famer, goes mostly by his first name, and has his number retired because of his nimble play in the field ...

August Vollmer was a police chief in the first half of the 20th century in California. He was a trailblazer in modern law enforcement techniques and served as president of the International Association of Police Chiefs in 1921. He is frequently referred to as the Father of Modern Law Enforcement. The push to criminalize drug use largely arose during his career. In a 1936 paper on the subject, Vollmer said, "Drug addiction … is not a police problem; it never has been, and never can be solved by policemen. It is first and last a medical problem." It makes one wonder where we would be today if his advice had been heeded.

But I digress - I'm rattling on and haven't even covered all the antipasti. I've saved the best for last. It's actually one of the best dishes I've had all year - fresh shelling beans with pork soffrito.

I can understand inner-city legislators desperately seizing on charter schools as a possible solution; but why are legislators from affluent suburban districts jumping on the voucher-charter school bandwagon? Why did state Sen. Jane Cunningham, R-7th District, of Chesterfield, sponsor a bill forcing school districts to accept transfer students and expanding charter schools statewide? Why did state Rep. Cole McNary, R-86th District, of Chesterfield, sponsor amendments to allow taxpayer-funded vouchers for transfers to private and parochial schools?

Beer-battered ginger shoots ($9) are more delicate than you'll find at most tempura houses; their subtle tang becomes a vehicle for a puffy coating that forms a golden, crackling shell. The shoots nestle next to two rows of cool, thinly sliced zucchini, a neutral palette for the citrus-soy hot-and-sour sauce that moistens the bottom of the plate. Off to one side, Fox further celebrates the squash by making a creamy puree that has the richness and density of avocado.

Yet the menu isn't immune to indifference. Salads, from a long list, are surprisingly dull. Blackened cod tacos on tender corn tortillas are fine, but nothing I couldn't get off a neighborhood food truck. The burger is juicy and flavorful, but, come on, a burger?

Ms. Rawlings-Blake's dismissal of her challengers' proposals is somewhat unfair, in that it doesn't take into account their ideas for mitigating the revenue loss or fully measure the ancillary benefits of higher population. Senator Pugh is the only of the tax-cutting candidates who has not laid out a plan for managing the transition to lower rates. Mr. Landers, whose background is in real estate, proposed the idea of following Washington's lead and charging much higher rates for vacant and blighted properties than for occupied ones. That would have the dual effect of providing tax relief for those who chose to move to Baltimore and would encourage absentee owners to do something with their property. Mr. Rolley has also endorsed that idea. And City Councilman Carl Stokes, who dropped out of the mayor's race to run for re-election, has proposed tax reduction legislation and is suggesting that the city lift the homestead property tax break in conjunction with lowering rates, a mechanism that could allow the city to maintain its revenue, keep tax bills stable for existing homeowners and eliminate a disincentive for new families to buy homes in the city.

6. "Green." Do a good deed for your favorite handyman and a kindness to the environment by choosing gifts that use less energy, spew less pollution and create less waste. Examples: Cordless, electric yard tools, such as lawnmowers and trimmers are better for the environment than ones that use gasoline.

Kevin Goldthwaite: Central defender, 28, one season with Timbers. Another player who didn't play much - three games - but made an impression with his ability to hold his own on defense.

Ciao Vito feels as if it landed on Northeast Alberta Street via the witness protection program, its warm, elegant decor and tradition-rich Italian menu hidden behind an incongruously pop-colored exterior on a street beset by passing novelties.

You can put together a menu to make you feel as if you're in a checkered-tablecloth spaghetti-and-chianti joint or one that's all Northwest fresh and local. It's a lovely blend.
Two-faced monster: Kim G. turns up at Jacqueline's house with a copy of the Herald News with the story about Danielle's decision to press charges against Ashley. Um, why? Jacqueline rips into her for charging up to the courthouse arm-in-arm "like a busted up 'Sex and the City." Kim G. says she won't apologize for going with Danielle. Jacqueline says it's ridiculous that Danielle expects people to forgive and forget what she did 25 years ago and yet press charges against Ashley for a hair pull. "This girl has no one, and she asked me to do certain things, and I do them," Kim G. says. Jacqueline suggests that Kim G. stand by her side when she has to take Ashley court, and Kim G. agrees. "I feel like you're being two-faced," Jacqueline accuses. Kim G. agrees that she is. At least she's honest.

By 1992, bin Laden was arguing that other extremists, who were focused on local rulers and Israel, had not gone far enough. He called for attacks on "the head of the snake," the United States. Bin Laden believed the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, home to Islam’s holy cities of Medina and Mecca, defiled Muslim land. He also charged that the United States supported repressive Arab regimes and defended Israel.

The business had its challenges. Many agencies closed their doors in the late 1990s following airline commission cuts, and big dot-com travel companies like Expedia were spending millions to court customers.

It happened immediately in the second half. UK freshman big man Anthony Davis finished an alley-oop to start a 13-2 run that demoralized Kansas and infused Kentucky with the confidence to take a 17-point lead at the 10-minute mark. That the Jayhawks became so discombobulated by a quick burst like that was alarming. Only in the final minute did they get the deficit down to single digits.
That's carried out in the decor. The company commissioned a half-dozen local artists to each do their take on red elephants.

Periodically, the art will be auctioned for charity and refreshed with new works.
Early in the program, the Motown hits were an enjoyable romp. Audience members filled in for absent Supremes by singing with enthusiasm, and Ross cycled through Where Did Our Love Go, Baby Love, Stop!

Early in this study of Vladimir Putin, journalist Masha Gessen recalls the cloud of uncertainty that enveloped the Kremlin in 1999. President Boris Yeltsin was ailing, near the end of his term, and his inner circle was desperate to find a successor. "A tiny group of people, besieged and isolated, were looking for someone to take over the world's largest landmass, with all its nuclear warheads and all its tragic history," Gessen writes, "and the only thing smaller than the pool of candidates seems to have been the list of qualifications required of them."
Jared Sullinger led Ohio State in blocks this season with 39 in 1,123 minutes on the court. Williams had 23 blocks in 191 minutes.

He'll have more confidence next season as a sophomore.

1. This should be a tense and fantastic series, with high-energy games going down to the wire or spilling into overtime. These are virtual Xerox copies; the Blues (first) and the Kings (second) were at the top of the NHL for fewest goals allowed. Their defense-first philosophy is backed by the superb goaltending of Brian Elliott and LA's Jonathan Quick. Veteran coaches Ken Hitchcock and Darryl Sutter turned their teams' seasons around. It's a coin-flip series. One side will ultimately crack.
The tumult around security centered on the man who throttled Hughes on Monday morning.

Instructions: Preheat oven to 350º. Trim excess fat and reserve to render, if desired. Remove any remaining pinfeathers from goose, rinse well and dry with paper towels. Place goose, breast side down, in a V-rack set in a roasting pan. Air-dry for 20-30 minutes. Prick the skin all over with a fork, being careful to not pierce the meat (the dripping meat juices will keep the skin from browning). Season well inside and out with kosher salt and pepper. Close cavity and neck opening with skewers.
Timing depends on whether your group snacks throughout or talks first and eats later. In the first scenario, have all food ready by the time the doorbell rings. Otherwise, have your cheese sauce ready, your macaroni cooked and bread crumbs ready to sprinkle before the guests arrive.

Scientists, rangers, and park supporters have taken another step to return Bay checkerspot butterflies to their historic home at Edgewood County Park and Natural Preserve in Redwood City. The butterflies suffered local extinction in 2002 due to a decrease in the number of their host plant: dwarf plantain. Ecologist Dr. Stuart B. Weiss called it "drive-by extinction" when his research showed how exhaust fumes (nitrous oxides and ammonia) from cars driving on nearby Interstate 280 fertilize nonnative grasses, allowing them to drive out native wildflowers that support the butterflies. Edgewood now is being restored by rotational mowing, and checkerspot host plant and nectar sources are abundant in the area once again. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service granted a permit to transfer butterflies, in both caterpillar and adult form, from a healthy population at Coyote Ridge to 15 acres of prime habitat at Edgewood. In February 2011, more than 4,000 caterpillars were introduced. Volunteer monitors counted about 130 adults during the flight season (March and April 2011), also noting about 2,000 caterpillars (offspring of those butterflies) this winter. To further the odds of firmly reestablishing this species, another 4,852 caterpillars were introduced in February 2012. More than 100 butterflies have been spotted already this year, a strong indicator of success. To further increase the likelihood of success, additional adults were introduced on April 3, 2012. The larvae were reintroduced into their historic home, in the serpentine grassland between the serpentine loop and the clarkia trails. The site can be observed from the serpentine loop, facing the freeway, and looking across the swale and upslope. The site is protected and not crossed by public trails. Ranger John Trewin says, "We ask people to stay on trails to protect the sensitive habitat, but the views from those trails are spectacular."

Pages 144-150: Nicholas Ciccotelli came down to the visitors center with two friends to pick up a map. They passed a police officer talking to two park rangers or employees. They overheard them talking about "the description matches." They walking inside and grabbed a 4-mile walking pamphlet and together walked as far as the corner of the parking lot where the Japanese prickly ash is when he said he heard yelling. They heard a man yelling, "Put the knife down, put the knife down, put the knife down" and then heard two shots. Question: Did you turn around and take a look? Answer: We stopped moving and we looked back and we hard the yelling and then we heard the shooting. We didn't really go back towards that because generally trying not to go toward the bullet shots.

The pineapple habanero wings were lightly breaded and perfectly sauced, with a surprisingly light kick and a pleasantly delicate sweetness. The chili cheddar wings may have spent a bit too much time under the heat lamp, but they retained a pleasantly smoky chili flavor and were cleverly garnished with oyster crackers. The kalamata and feta wings - lightly briny, with a generous sprinkle of salty cheese - were the standout, even eliciting more than two words of praise from my otherwise wing-engrossed, sauce-slathered, extremely content spouse.
