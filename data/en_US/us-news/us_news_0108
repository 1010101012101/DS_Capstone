Why the crackdown on photography? Carlos Miller, a Miami-based multimedia journalist and author of the blog Photography Is Not a Crime, says that law enforcement agencies have felt threatened by photographers since the videotape of Los Angeles police officers beating Rodney King made the rounds in 1991.

But in California, where the taste of a Cara Cara orange straight from the tree will always eclipse the flashier pleasures made possible by a packet of xanthan gum, the cooking in a contemporary restaurant is often based on something else entirely: seasonal, well-sourced produce presented in a way that lets its virtues shine through undisturbed. New York chef David Chang once dismissed the style as "figs on a plate," but as Californians know, there is nothing wrong with a plate of figs. You could enrobe them in caramelized honey gelatin or encase them in clay with tonka beans, but the right fig is fine on its own.

When treatment of hepatitis C is advised, two medicines have been given simultaneously for many years. Those drugs are peginterferon and ribavirin. About 50 percent of chronic hepatitis C patients respond well to this regimen. However, blacks have a poorer response, with only 25 percent achieving viral suppression. A true breakthrough has arrived in the treatment of hepatitis C. Two new drugs, telaprevir (Incivek) and boceprevir (Victrelis) have had a huge impact in improving treatment success. Either of these drugs, given in conjunction with the standard treatment of ribavirin and peginterferon, greatly increases the cure rates for blacks and whites.

Solid putting and shot-making on the final hole and then the first two holes of the sudden-death playoff are the reason why he’s your new Masters champion.

Don't overthink your decision. Depending upon your culinary curiosity and personal tastes (and boundaries), choose something that looks good and place your order.

There's also this slightly pompous suggestion that a best-of-seven series is the most honest way of sorting out the best teams. Since when should anyone care about sorting out the best teams?

March Madness thrives with a single-elimination tournament.

I've tried to get copies of the fee schedules that health insurance companies and Medicare pay to providers, but the physicians' offices always say they cannot release that information.

"People Like Us": Chris Pine ("Star Trek") plays the son of a recently departed man. Heavily in debt, the son could use an inheritance, but his father left money instead to an adult daughter (Elizabeth Banks) Pine's character never knew about.

The premise intrigues, and Pine and Banks are likable actors who don't usually star in studio comedy/dramas like this one. Come to think of it, there aren't studio films like this. June 29

When frost is expected, protect tender garden plants such as bougainvillea, citrus, fuchsia and succulents by covering them. Remove the covering when the temperature rises. If you use frost cloth (sold in garden centers), the cloth can remain in place.

This technique works best when employed early and reapplied in January.

Smaller arenas are fine (e.g. Duke), but they have to be more than a glorified gym which is what the RAC is.

That's where they met an opponent that could put up points as well as it stopped them. The only team nationally to rank in the top five in scoring offense (79.2 points per game) and scoring defense (51.5 points per game), Notre Dame showed Maryland again and again just what it was missing. The demonstration wasn't pretty.
"Oh, yeah!" someone exclaims as cans and bottles cascade to the ground.

"Our financial condition has been deteriorating for several years, and we have been operating with a very low cash balance."
Once here, he moves from hostel to hostel ahead of the maximum stay, which is anywhere from three nights to three weeks. He grumbles when he has to climb to the top bunk, in a six-bed dorm room, but the price is right - between $15 and $30 a night. He rarely eats ballpark food, eating lunch at the Salvation Army and fast-food joints for breakfast and dinner.
When my 25-year-old daughter calls me on this behavior, I get annoyed, but I know she’s right: Profanity damages the society in which we live by subjecting others to intense negative output.
On Saturday, Kid Rock, a member of Michigan's rock 'n' roll royalty, will hit the stage of the Fox Theatre accompanied by his regular band and the DSO led by music director Leonard Slatkin. A benefit concert, the performance is expected to raise $1 million for the DSO. The set list will be loaded with Kid Rock hits, from edgy rock-rap hybrids like "Bawitdaba" and "Devil Without a Cause" to the country-tinged power ballad "Born Free."

"You've got 10 percent unemployment, and you add another 5 or 10 percent" for discouraged workers or those stuck in part-time positions, because they can't find full-time work, says Doug Hart, a retail specialist at the consulting firm BDO USA. But the remaining 80 percent, having survived layoffs, "are feeling more secure about their jobs."

Before the elections, investors have the monthly U.S. government jobs report to digest. It often sets the market tone for a week or two after its release as it's considered the key barometer of the health of the world's largest economy.
Bullies are individuals; I hope there's some nuance to the Wiley character. Max eventually thinks he's figured out what to do about Wiley, and let's just say the results are mixed - as they're bound to be in just about every real-life situation, I bet. There's no cathartic "Now, that's how you deal with a bully!" stuff.
WASHINGTON — Supporters of a proposed nuclear waste dump in Nevada urged a federal appeals court Wednesday to force the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to move forward on a licensing plan for the long-delayed project.
But if federal prosecutors announce new crackdowns — for, say, dispensaries near parks — the available real estate will disappear.
"The authors of that study mischaracterized the data to the point where it suggests they are either completely inept or intentionally trying to deceive," said Andrew Wyatt of the U.S. Association of Reptile Keepers, an advocacy group. "That they could survive from San Francisco to the Ohio Valley to Chesapeake Bay, it's absolutely ludicrous. They've been around 50 years, and have established themselves nowhere except the very southern tip of Florida."
"We're monitoring it," said Westcor spokeswoman Anita Walker.
That's disgraceful.
With a June 30 closing proposed, the Bailey Recreation Center may be saved and transformed into a temporary Westland City Hall.

In last week's 100 final, Bolt looked at the overhead video screen, slowed down, dropped his hands and abandoned his form well short of the finish line, and still won in a world record of 9.69.
Luque cautioned residents to call for help only if there was an emergency.

Such a finish is already guaranteed for Charlotte. But the Bobcats also are trying to avoid setting an NBA record for the worst winning percentage, held by the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers, who went 9-73 (.110). If the Bobcats, who have lost 19 consecutive games, lose their final four games, they will finish at .106.
The same employee of Check Cash Pacific told police that a week or two earlier a Comcast employee had entered the store, and told her that cable work was being installed elsewhere in the building and he needed to get back behind the locked partition to take some measurements. She didn't let him in, saying it was against company policy to let anyone into the secure area. The employee was not able to determine if Hagen was the employee in that incident, police said.
Berry agreed. "Working while in college provides students with valuable work experience, which may give them an competitive edge when they go to look for work after graduation." She advised students to first look for work on campus, pointing out that most universities offer both work study options for students who qualify (work study is a federal financial aid program) and student employment options, which provide a paycheck just like off-campus jobs.
At the time, Merck said the cuts would not start in earnest until next year.
About 200 cash mobs have sprung up across the U.S. since last summer, including nearly two dozen in California, according to Andrew Samtoy, a Cleveland attorney who has become something of a Pied Piper for the movement. He organized his own cash mob in November as a way to get strangers to meet for a fun outing that would also help boost the local economy. Samtoy garnered media attention for his efforts, and he enlisted friends in other U.S. cities to organize their own events.
The Committee on Energy and Commerce is considering a bill that would require the Department of Transportation to investigate minimum noise requirements and implement changes as soon as 2012. Oregon vehicle law includes restrictions on how loud a car can be, but, with the exception of specific equipment such as a horn or siren, does not address minimum sound levels.
Now we're worrying about low D-3 in kids, especially girls, because it's been connected with early menstruation. Combined with low D, early periods make them more vulnerable to all kinds of problems: obesity, stunted growth, asthma, heart trouble, childhood pregnancy, breast cancer and more. Put bluntly: Girls who are low on D and menstruate early can turn into short, fat, asthmatic kids who become sick adults. What to do?
POSSESSION: On Feb. 4, a 41-year-old resident of the 1700 block of Sparrow Point, Fenton, Mo., was arrested at Illinois Route 3 and West Pontoon Roads on charges of possession of 2.5 to 10 grams of cannabis and driving under the influence of alcohol.

Fifteen years later, and the film isnt any shorter. The dialogue is still peppered with groaners like Zanes blase line.
The Run for the Roses draws them to Churchill Downs. But what race goers wear is as much a spectacle in itself. Hats with flowers and feathers and brims so wide faces are hidden. Men get into the spirit, too, one notable this year for his red bowler hat, another for his checkered suit — with a matching hat, of course.
But he did find a way to express his appreciation for the Cleveland fans he still, clearly, wants to win over.
Are the Brits hardhearted? Durant Imboden, of www.Europeforvisitors.com, sees this as more a legal matter. "While the Scottish parking warden could be faulted for a lack of kindheartedness, one could also argue that the warden was simply enforcing the law so that handicapped-parking spaces would be available to Blue Badge holders," he said in an e-mail to me.
The proponents latest stealth move to accomplish their ill-conceived goal is to seek to qualify a measure for a San Francisco ballot in an upcoming election.
Assemblyman Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, wrote a letter to Gov. Jerry Brown to "express outrage and indignation" at Peevey's action given what he called a "decade of mistrust" under Peevey's tenure.

Viso: Definitely here. I feel like I've just been through a four-year transition and am just beginning to see the fruits of my efforts take shape. I hope that in four to five years the sculpture garden will be finished. I'm trying to foster more crossovers between our departments and to enable artists to come in through one program and exit through another. There are so many opportunities for us to really use the whole platform instead of just the independent parts, and artists are very interested in blurring all of those lines. It takes less bureaucracy or less autonomy and more working together. So I'm trying to support collaboration as much internally as externally.
Marlins newcomer Heath Bell (1-3), who lost his job as Miami's closer after blowing four saves, pitched a perfect ninth and lowered his ERA to 9.28.
Our legislators have done everything possible to send the message to Washington that Arizona is in trouble. Our border is dangerous, our taxpayers are carrying a colossal burden and we have thousands of economic refugees who desperately need a solution to living in the shadows.
With red ink used on the left and blue on the right, the cursive sweeps with pronounced capital letters illustrated the lineups for the first game the Cardinals will play this spring. Well, "game" should be in quotations because it's an intrasquad game, and weather permitting the Red team will face the Blue team at noon Florida time on Field 1.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — It happens every Derby. They come here each year with a horse and a dream and once in a rare while it happens.
In a game where fill-in starter Wesley Matthews set a new career-high with 30 points, it was a defensive play by Matthews that helped the Trail Blazers avoid their third straight loss.
The Safari breach was first identified by Stanford researcher Jonathan Mayer, who published a blog entry on his discoveries Feb. 16.

Yeah, that would be the starch-collared, buttoned-down Indians.
Understand what this means," Christie said in his State of the State message, the second one he has delivered since becoming governor in January 2010,. "Every New Jerseyan will get a cut in taxes. The working poor. The struggling middle class. The new college graduates getting their first job. The senior citizens who have already retired. The single mom. The job creators. The parents trying to afford to send their son or daughter to college.
Fiercely patriotic, he has visited the troops in the Middle East. He could summon many character witnesses to his substantial acts of generosity, thoughtfulness and kindness. Tressel took Ohio State to heights unscaled since Hayes was the coach. Of course Tressel, like Hayes, was not without flaws. Neither angel nor demon, Tressel is only a human being. Still, on the question of his active involvement in a major ethics scandal, he is really, most sincerely guilty.
In the end, the suburban courthouses would remain closed for weekend bond hearings and weddings - which will still save some money, but not as much as originally announced, said Cook County Commissioner Peter N. Silvestri, a Northwest Side and suburban Republican who worked on the deal.

"When I shot it, I threw it up (and) then I started to look toward the ground to land," Roy said. "I looked up and it went in. I'm thinking, 'Oh, this is going to be one of those finishes.'"
Democrats, meanwhile, say the spotlight could turn against Christie when he stands for re-election in 2013. New Jersey will be one of the few important campaigns waged in the nation, and the Republican governor could face a tough challenge because the state leans Democrat.
Last month, DeMarco said that preliminary findings showed Fannie and Freddie could save $1.7 billion by reducing principal for some homeowners. But he cautioned that such a program would not solve the housing market's problems and indicated the agency would make a decision by the end of April.
In an ideal world, coaches would have no influence on a player seeking to transfer. Georgia football coach Mark Richt has an open-door policy which allows UGA transfers to go anywhere, including SEC rivals and future opponents.
She said Butler, the utility president, called her personally on Saturday to apologize — which she appreciated, but which did not give her confidence that they would have most of their power restored by Sunday night.
Northwest Christian overcame a coaching error in the second game, as a libero didn't start and therefore couldn't play for the rest of the game. Still, Northwest Christian ended the game on a 7-2 run, with the winning point coming on a ball that was dropped perfectly in a hole in the Thatcher defense by Marissa Boelter.
But we’ve gotten to the point where the studio’s big dumb movies use up almost all the oxygen in the room. They monopolize funds, hog multiplex screens, dominate airwaves and shout their simple slogans until they drown out the quieter pictures trying hard to build an audience without the benefit of IMAX, 3D, music videos and Happy Meals.
So what would the two have to offer each other if there is an alliance?
"It looks like a pattern," said Henry Eckhart of Common Cause Ohio. "It smells."

So yes, the two candidates show real differences of both style and substance on marijuana. Still, I'm not convinced their approaches as attorney general would wildly diverge. Holton says he would "happily enforce and uphold the state law," which he says voters approved for compassionate reasons. Rosenblum admits the law's rollout has been a bumpy ride. In separate interviews late last week, both said the law could use tweaking to clear up the gray areas and improve patient access to marijuana without inviting new problems.

Across the locker room, a somber Roy unsuccessfully tried to put it in perspective.
For all of this, he did not lose custody of the children he had with his wife, as most cads do. Elizabeth's death, in 2010, prevented that. John is the only parent they have, and one of the sadder pictures of the trial is Cate standing beside him, looking like his late wife. We get only one father; what's she to do?
If you want something more familiar, the list also includes about 17 sakes, also available in three sizes, with representation from Junmai ($6.50-$8 a glass), Ginjo ($9-$11) and Nama ($11.50-$12).
Interestingly, autism is also more common in the north, perhaps because moms there don't get enough sunlight to load up on vitamin D, a compound that plays a big role in development. We live in Montana, so again, who knows? Perhaps our address played a role.
The Hair Plus salon of Hillsborough offered its services at no charge during the weekend festival to benefit the organization Hair for the Gulf Coast, which collects human and animal hair to create booms in the gulf that soak up oil from the BP spill.

The second group of messages prosecutors played were made earlier, between December 2008 and June 18 of 2009. In those messages, Aaron LaRose called his wife a liar. He said she was sinning and was manipulated by Satan. He said she had better do what God wanted her to do.
Walt Weiss stood in front of his kneeling players on the left-field grass. The Regis Jesuit High School baseball coach wore a pullover windbreaker, uniform pants and hat, and for much of the game, he had been difficult to spot as the man in charge, going about his business quietly with a lineup card in hand.

Years from now when the last pages of baseball's sad steroid era are finally written, wouldn't it be something if baseball's historians are forced to recognize that the smartest sinner of this entire disgraced and confusing time turns out to be Mark McGwire?
Pinot's lengthy list of dishes includes several populous sections, including 25 entrees if you count "cafe meals," or sandwiches with fries or a salad. The problem with trying to satisfy everyone is you are apt to excite no one, and any ambitious plays are apt to be thrown for a loss. That has been the regrettable experience at Pinot in early visits. Simple dishes have been satisfactory and no better, and menu selections that suggest a level of complexity have been disappointing.
Floaters are a natural product of the aging process. They're produced when the vitreous humor – the transparent gel that fills about 80 percent of the eyeball and helps maintain its round shape – changes consistency over time, partially liquefying and shrinking, which causes it to pull away from the interior surface of the eyeball. When this happens, clumps of cells, pigment or stringy vitreous can break loose and begin wandering aimlessly within the eyeball.

Apples-to-apples comparisons are difficult because private prisons tend not to serve medically needy, seriously mentally ill and higher-security inmates, all of whom cost more. And most states, including Arizona, keep some functions in state hands, such as transporting inmates, classifying inmates' security levels and computing their time served.
