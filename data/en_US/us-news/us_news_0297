O’Neal was reported to have died from complications from the stroke, though it’s not clear what they were. In general, such complications can take many forms, Kennedy said. If a patient is bedridden, they’re more likely to develop infections, including potentially fatal ones. Often, he added, strokes lead to difficulty swallowing – and if contents go down the wrong pipe, they can lead to a life-threatening form of pneumonia called aspiration pneumonia. Scarring in the brain tissue caused by the stroke can also be a trigger for seizures.

What is your idea of a perfect weather day in Cleveland?
Don't expect help from midnight to 8 a.m. The response time for any emergency will be slow because of fewer police (deputies) on the street at that time. I'm concerned that by outsourcing, we have created a situation that can never be repaired. It will still cost us (Pacificans) money to receive adequate coverage at an acceptable level that we are accustomed to.

Danijel protects Ajla from his men, though not from other forms of brutality that the soldiers mete out -- he can't afford to give their secret away. When she is summoned to his quarters, they begin a sexual relationship, despite their differences. This is a political conflict, he argues. You are killing my people, she responds. Yet the relationship continues. Whether he's exercising a sick sort of power or she is simply trying to stay alive isn't clear, maybe not even to them at first. It's certainly a twisted relationship. Jolie goes to great lengths to show that everything is twisted, that the war has perverted everything about normal life, destroyed any semblance of sanity.

It wasn't surprising that these sentences jumped out at me. For two weeks I had been captivated by extraordinary sights -- the Great Wall near Beijing, the terra cotta warriors of Xi'an, the other-worldly karst pinnacles of Guilin and the dazzling 21st-century skyline of Shanghai -- but I also had been fascinated by the people of this dynamic, rapidly changing society, by their warmth and friendliness toward Americans and by the way they used language, not so much their own language (though I loved hearing its rapid staccato cadence), but by the way they used ours. The Chinese, I discovered, are hungry for English.

After the moment of silence, a small group walked through crunching leaves to gather around the large shrub where the boy's body was discovered.
Conservatives see the interlock research as liberal interventionism, imposing extra costs on consumers to protect them from themselves. But that's pretty much the way they felt about Ralph Nader's pioneering investigations into automotive safety in the mid-1960s, which led to such standard features as seat belts — and that worked out OK. If sensors can thwart drunk drivers, they could save thousands of lives. And if research shows that they fail at an unacceptable rate, or catch drivers who aren't legally drunk, they're unlikely to attract the political support needed for approval.
The House voted 73 to 67 to approve the bill, but Senate leaders delayed action on the measure Tuesday night. A spokesman said it will become part of negotiations with DFL Gov. Mark Dayton that have included the Minnesota Vikings stadium and other capital projects around the state.

But in October 2006, beekeepers nationwide began to report hive losses of 30 to 90 percent. It's not unusual to lose 10 percent of hives in winter, but this was a baffling shutdown. Keepers found live queens but no or very few worker bees. They weren't dead in the hives, which often still contained honey and immature brood. They simply disappeared. Researchers labeled it "Colony Collapse Disorder."

A. Pay attention to people, and make sure the team has a noble purpose, he said. Pay attention to the detail, but don't micromanage. Before anything goes out the door, make sure all the best talent looks at it. The more it's about the work, the less it will focus on the individual. When it is about the team, you can create more efficient and effective programs by utilizing the team's diverse perspectives and skill sets on the project. Effectiveness and efficiency are a result of having diverse perspectives and skill sets. Be a lifelong learner, continue to read and consume. Create a leadership style that fits your organization's reason for being.

Incarceration destroys families and jobs, exactly what people need to have in order to stay away from crime. Incarcerated criminals are more likely to re-offend than similar people given alternative sentences. To break the cycle of crime, people need help.

We are seeing a backlash against all public employees. Part of it is human nature. I understand that part. Public employees have pensions. Fewer and fewer of us in the private sector do. Also, public employees are less likely to be laid off in hard times. So employees in the private sector get jealous and angry. We're taxpayers, we say, as if public employees aren't.

As a newspaperman, I spent a few years covering Penn State football and many more opining on the sport at Ohio State. I "get" the romance of the game. Texas fans get sentimental about a big drum, and Ohio State fans get that way about a grove of buckeye trees. There are "Hook 'em Horns" signs and "O!-HI!-O!" semaphores that are like fraternity handshakes. They signify that the fans are members of the same club.

I can still remember the first time I saw Los Angeles. It was December 1980, I was 9 years old, and the view came from the back seat of my older brother Lee's brown Chevette as we climbed up the Grapevine. My two sisters and I were crammed into the car along with all of Lee's earthly possessions — well, most of them, anyway, since the butterfly chair he had tied to the roof flew off somewhere near Kettleman City — which amounted to stacks of paperback books, three typewriters, every issue of Starlog that had been published to date and whatever pots and pans our mother could do without. In short, the essentials any college student would need for his first apartment, along with three younger siblings to help with the packing and schlepping.

Stafford, Ndamukong Suh and Nate Burleson reworked their deals to get the Lions to the mandatory salary cap. And now Johnson's deal gives president Tom Lewand and general manager Martin Mayhew a far more manageable 2012 salary-cap number than the $21.2 million number had he played out the final year of his rookie contract. There's now more room to re-sign left tackle Jeff Backus (a must ...deal with it, haters) and perhaps middle linebacker Stephen Tulloch, who's possibly seeking a deal three times as large as the $3.2-million "bargain" he gave the Lions last summer.

There may be a physiological reason for the visceral reaction to that figure with its cartoonish skull and gaping mouth. Harvard neurobiology professor Margaret Livingstone found in her research on macaque monkeys that neurons in the brain respond to exaggerated features—huge eyes or tiny noses—more than to common ones. "That's why I think a caricature of an emotion works so well," she says. "It's what our nerve cells are tuned to."

She and her husband Ethan (Joshua Leonard) join a group of Protestant evangelicals. It's the 70s, so there's still a whiff of Jesus-freak patchouli around this corduroy-and-plaid-clad crew, but the film never presents them as objects of ridicule.

Pitching coach Dan Warthen said with Niese, he has focused on grinding through an entire season.
Mike Carrier, the governor's natural resources policy adviser, insists that the original dam removal agreement contained adequate protections against additional liabilities for Oregon ratepayers and that he hadn't seen any viable amendments from ICNU.

At Xi'an, I bypassed tour groups and for $1 took a local bus, No. 306, from the train station to the Terracotta Warriors and Horses museum, an hourlong ride. About 8,000 life-size terracotta warriors stand or kneel in pits at the site, along with their horses. Each warrior is unique, with variations in mustaches, top knots, armor and stance. China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, ordered these soldiers made around 246 B.C. to accompany him to the afterlife.

Being able to relax on a beach without worrying about a child possibly drowning or needing to use a bathroom every hour: Priceless. As part of the child-free weekend, we indulged in a couple's massage and facials at the Serenity by the Sea Spa, stopped by the outlet malls and visited Baytowne Village, across from the hotel property, which is a lively area around a harbor with bars, live music, boutiques and family attractions. But our favorite vacation game is playing fantasy real estate, when we drive through the most scenic parts of town and pick out the homes we would purchase if we won the lottery. Our drive took us through quaint coastal communities along 30-A, including Seaside, the picture-perfect community where "The Truman Show" was filmed.
