Created by composer Damon Intrabartolo and lyricist Jon Hartmere Jr., "bare" enjoys a cult following but not the kind of fame associated with, for example, "Spring Awakening."

All that is long overdue. But Benson's amendment, which could and should have been crafted to command the enthusiastic support of reasonable people across the political spectrum, inexplicably exempts two large classes of donors -- labor unions and individuals, including the billionaires who have single-handedly kept several presidential candidates afloat in the 2012 campaign cycle -- from the rigorous disclosure requirements it would impose on corporations.

New York's attack after halftime was limited to counterattacks, mostly, and was hindered by a lack of patience. Henry and McCarty did well setting the table for Rodgers, who fired just wide on one attempt and was set to finish a Richards cross when Donovan raced back to knock the ball away.
"I think he would be serviceable there and probably eventually move back over to right tackle, but you could play him there," the scout said. "He's athletic enough to do it. Like I said, I think it was a good pick. I don't think anybody really thought that (he) would be there."
"Look, you're a chef and you love food, and consider it a huge contributing factor to the quality of your life. And though your naturopath voted for a vegan diet, that's just not going to happen. So how can you continue to enjoy some of the things you eat and still get healthy? Huh?"

I was stationed at Ft. Bliss, Texas, in 1968 for a year at an Army language school learning Vietnamese. During the breaks in the endless memorization of the endless monosyllabic vocabulary, we would escape over the border to Juarez, Mexico, or out into the wasteland of west Texas to reclaim a bit of sanity. I met a family through a church group that invited me to their ranch on weekends. And I still bless them for their thoughtfulness.

A I've always been very connected to my nose, and every time I would do research on a building or city for work, I would come across an anecdote, a part of the story, where I would think "What did it smell like?"

In the bottom of the inning, the Mets loaded the bases with one out, bringing Nieuwenhuis to the plate with a chance at redemption. All he could manage was a weak ground ball to first baseman Brandon Belt, who threw home in hopes of starting a double play. Catcher Buster Posey earned the force at home, but on the throw back to first, he was clipped by a sliding Scott Hairston and his throw sailed wide into right field. Ruben Tejada came around from second to score, sliding into home.

Mandel's state political filings show that trip was in March.
No. 3 Baylor (29-7) vs. No. 10 Xavier (23-12), 4:15 p.m., Channel 2: A big question for Baylor always is whether its talented frontcourt is going to show up. Quincy Acy, Perry Jones III and Quincy Miller average in double figures, but their lack of consistency is startling. Baylor enjoys a decided height advantage over Xavier, but the Musketeers are more physical. Xavier needs a big game from 7-footer Kenny Frease, who dominated Lehigh in the second round. Frease isn't the most athletic big guy, but he can carve out space with his body and could do some damage. The point guard matchup between Baylor's Pierre Jackson and Xavier's Tu Holloway should be excellent. Both can get into the lane at will and also make the three-pointer. Baylor's Brady Heslip made nine three-pointers in the win over Colorado, and when he is that hot from the outside, Baylor is tremendously difficult to defend. Xavier's perimeter defense has been solid, for the most part. Xavier's Mark Lyons is a three-point threat too, and Baylor's short guards can be exploited on the perimeter.

A life among spider monkeys is an agile leap from the Hamptons, where clients like Calvin Klein depend on von Gal's spatial refinement and planting expertise. While her gardens are artful and modern, they are also highly naturalistic. Von Gal favors English-style meadows and swaths of ornamental grasses that mimic patterns in nature. Klein says he first admired her work when he saw a wall of bamboo she'd planted for the previous owners of a house he bought in Miami. Since then she has worked on several of his projects, including the garden at his new modernist Southampton home and its sculptural swimming pool. "She's a minimalist, and there's serenity about what she does. She doesn't mix a lot of things—maybe a stand of willow or sea grape," Klein explains. "Her look is architectural, but it's soft and has movement at the same time."

Several years ago a brain tumor put an end to David Guerrero's career as a private chef to an NBA basketball player. But that life-threatening episode, in which he had to re-learn certain things that were second nature to him (including tasting), also propelled him to strike out again in the culinary world. He worked hard and landed in the kitchens at Philippe, Hotel ZaZa, Bistro Moderne and eventually Samba Grille where the Quito, Ecuador-born chef has been encouraged to infuse the menu with native Ecuadorian touches and Peruvian flavors. The downtown steakhouse has quickly earned buzz for Guerrero's South American savvy - ceviche of shrimp and calamari; sea bass carpaccio with leche de tigre; scallop tiradito with chicha morada; braised pork arepas; and Peruvian anticuchos of grilled beef heart. Here the rotisserie chicken comes with huacatay sauce (Peruvian "black mint"), the sea bass is glossed in aji Amarillo butter and the suckling pick is served with "dirty" hominy.
Power forward Deshaun Thomas ranks as the most difficult scorer to defend in the Final Four. His unique combination of scoring skills makes him a 3-point threat, adept at mid-range scoring and also a danger in the post. The Buckeyes at last have back the “A” game of Sullinger, the All-American who had a tough February as opponents ganged up on him but was named East Region most outstanding player.
And the feud between Lansing and Detroit? Enough. There is something to be abhorred about relentless, positive action that begins to resemble relentless, negative bulldozing.

Now, seven years after that natural disaster, the New Orleans schools are seen as a gem for urban public school renewal. Several things led to that success, including adopting the right sort of charters, such as the non-profit KIPP schools, which operates nine schools on five campuses serving 2,500 students in New Orleans. KIPP does charters right. It has a school here and inevitably will be a part of the solution.

Eli Manning’s second trip to his hometown was as miserable as his first one, though the blame doesn’t lie with him. (He threw for 406 yards and two touchdowns.) The Giants’ pass rush couldn’t get within a breath of Brees for much of the game, the running game was awful again, the secondary was gashed and the defense on the whole gave up a ton of big plays.

When Buscaino fails — as he does — to outline a plan for dealing with the city's financial problems, or to attempt a redefinition of what city government should be, what it should deliver and how it should pay for it, or to take a stance on taxes or other revenue options, we shudder. Yet we find it easier to give him, as a novice, a bit of slack that we must deny to the veteran Furutani.

Passot still thinks and acts like one of them. His hands are tough and muscular after decades exercising his knife skills, and his black leather loafers - not clogs - are deeply worn. When his fellow cooks drag, he pushes them on with a, "C'mon, guys! Let's move!" He can bicker with an expeditor who can't keep up with the orders as well as he can, and his face reddens as he deftly juggles pots and pans. Other than his gray hair, he fits right in.
Consider the balance of vegetable flavors and the eventual use of your stock. Portobello mushrooms will yield a stock too dark for many vegetable soups, for example; broccoli and other members of the cabbage family produce a stock that would overwhelm a delicate vegetable risotto.

Whitney Houston’s last 10 years have been the object of speculation and curiosity, and quite a bit of rubbernecking, too. Many people who never knew her believe that they understand what happened to Houston during that final decade.

Or picture a criminal hearing at which paperless probation departments, feet planted firmly in the current decade, must revert to the past and print out their electronic reports so courts can physically place the paper versions in their files or scan or retype the data into the local court's computer system because the court can't receive reports electronically. Probation, parole, mental health, police, sheriff, corrections, out-of-state courts — they are linked and can instantaneously share information with one another, but not with a trial court in California. And trial courts can't share information among themselves.

What alters or heightens the meaning and message of these pieces is that they are being performed by eight actors whose varied ethnic backgrounds cannot help but put into sharper relief both the naivete and sentimentality - as well as the idealism and satirical bite - of Western artists writing about places and people perceived as "exotic" or at least different.

Unlike many of today's popular celebrities, Knowles does not use a stylist except for a handful of red carpet events. It's her ability to meld traditional basics in highlighter colors, sporty knits and tribal prints with a refreshingly understated appeal that has drawn attention from the fashion set. When she arrived atJ. Crew's spring 2012 runway presentation last year with her sister, for instance, she wore a sleeveless shocking-pink shell paired with royal blue and gold Jacquard pants — creating quite a contrast with Beyoncé's gold sequin cocktail dress and nude peep-toe heels and showcasing her innate knack for putting together her own outfits.

Rhodes, who grew up in North Carolina, is comfortable not wearing her wig on this day. Her signature red hair is just fuzz for now, but her other signature -- that high-wattage smile -- is in full force, and she mentions only in passing the morphine patch she's wearing to help with a nagging pain in her hip bones. It's clearly not easy for her to sit for long, and she's walking more slowly than her usual ebullient pace.

“Theater A,” she writes, framing a metaphor for these divided feelings, “is where we see goodness in everything, beauty and generosity or, conversely, someone’s need for love.

I've got a hunch they're long-tailed ducks masquerading between winter and summer plumages, but I can't be certain. I huff warm air on the lenses and rub them clear with the hem of my T-shirt. Another look reveals their white eye masks and long black tails before they dive and disappear.
The trip to Hackberry Spring is a good choice for your first secondary-trail trek. It's not too long or too difficult, and most of the way is well marked and easy to follow. Best of all, once you leave the main trail, about two miles into the hike, you'll feel as if you have the world to yourself.
Detractors of the annual exam might write this off as anecdote, but I've found three prostate cancers and several skin cancers this year on routine physicals.

The result is a massive battle sequence—scripted by Martin himself and largely shot in a quarry in Northern Ireland—that, according to Benioff, could run for “at least half an episode.” While most hour-long TV episodes are filmed in less than 10 days, the Blackwater episode took about a month of wet, muddy night shoots.

There are piranhas here, the sexiest and toothiest animal of the Amazon. Most of what you read about piranhas is blatant exaggeration and Hollywood hype, King says. They don't attack people -- well, unless they are already dead or bleeding. And, well, they have been known to attack cattle. And yes, they do gnaw bones until they are bare of flesh.

As Hitchcock alluded to, they have to be better at even strength. The Sharks are making some lineup changes, hoping for more sustained time in the Blues' zone.

Amid the devastating violence of the two world wars, Mr. Eksteins observes, the norms of behavior and belief that had governed social relations for centuries broke down. Critics, reflecting their times, increasingly saw in the fiery canvases of Van Gogh and other "misfit" Modernists not only a new way of perceiving the world but also a spiritual response to an age in which few certitudes had gone unchallenged. "Van Gogh's greatest brilliance may have been his doubt," Mr. Eksteins writes. "That doubt now pervades our entire enterprise."

When the cabbage harvest peaks in autumn, families gather to produce kim-jang, the winter kimchi supply. As Scanlan recalls the ritual, her family would prepare about 80 heads, packing them in large earthenware pots that were buried to insulate them and keep them from freezing. Choe remembers putting a marker in the ground to indicate where the family's pots were buried so they would be possible to locate after the snow fell.
Tervel Dlagnev, Columbus: Trains at ORTC; 2011 world team trials champ; 2009 world bronze medalist.
The engineers who designed the Internet focused on connection and communication, not safety and security. That's one reason hackers have been able to take surreptitious control of Internet-connected devices, cripple websites and steal valuable data. Now, lawmakers are considering whether to vastly expand the government's role in protecting Internet services and corporate computer networks against cyber attack. But while the online security threats are serious, encouraging private industry to funnel information to the government poses its own set of problems.

But to answer the South Florida radio guy’s question, I keep thinking about an incredible tableau I witnessed — as unexpected as it was explanatory.
Notes: Jewsbury was named team captain. …Along with Perlaza and Cooper, the starters against the Sounders were: Perkins (GK), Steve Purdy (RD) and Wallace (LD), along with Brunner and Kevin Goldthwaite (CDs) on the backline. Jeremy Hall (LM) and Sal Zizzo (RM) as outside midfielders, with Jewsbury and Peter Lowry the central midfielders. …Defenders Quavas Kirk and Taylor Mueller were cut this week. Kirk played for the Timbers last season. The Timbers selected Mueller, out of the University of Washington, in the third round of the supplemental draft. …Midfielder
This being Lohan, it's not all about the legal issues. There's also this:
Still, it sounded like Umenyiora was planning to state his case last offseason - until his rocky '09 season resulted in a demotion late in the year. Basically, the rug had been pulled out from under him before he got to the negotiating table, which is why he decided to pipe down and try to reestablish his value by returning to form last season. In case you forgot or missed it, his "Eff it mentality" quotes from last training camp are making much more sense now, huh?
Then he added one large caveat about the Arden Hills industrial eyesore in line to become a roomy mecca for tailgating fans. "It's a great idea," said Cleaver, who lives near the site. "It's just, why are we paying for it?"
The trial is expected to take until the end of the month in Judge Marjorie Koller's courtroom, with the prosecution likely to present its case through the end of next week. Durst's wife and stepdaughter are scheduled to testify today.

Buying dozens of guns at a time is legal in many states, including Arizona and Texas. But lying on a form at a gun shop about who will own the gun is a crime.
"I plan on playing (Monday) but obviously it's concerning. Hopefully, with meds and treatment, it'll settle down the irritation and we can be in a situation at least like the Houston game where they got me ready to go and I can get through a game."
“(Right-hander Kelvin) Herrera has a changeup that lets him get lefties out,” Yost said. “(Aaron) Crow is our All-Star from last year. And we’re not sending (Jonathan) Broxton out at this time. So it was an obvious choice.”
Choir member Anne Waltz, 25 years old at the time, remembers getting on the roof with Schuller and his wife, Arvella, who played the organ, which was also hoisted up there. The members of this first-ever drive-in church listened to the bellowing voice of their pastor through movie loudspeakers hooked on to their car windows.
But the so-called off-price stores, such as T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, often pick up products that have been discontinued and sell them cheaply, says Michael Dart, co-author of the book "The New Rules of Retail." Shoppers probably won't find them for less -- or at all -- online.
The process took time. The Chicago Police Department sent me to the Cook County Traffic Court. When I requested how many tickets for the offense had been written in recent years, they supplied me with data and told me that tickets also go to the city’s Administrative Hearings Department.

Kevin Jonas and Deleasa have been rather low-key about their relationship, and she's made few, if any, red carpet appearances on his arm. We did dig up one photo of Deleasa in our archives -- she was photographed for a story on her school back in 2000 -- but posting a photo of someone from their middle-school years? We're not that devoid of morals.
Criminal history/bankruptcy: Operating vehicle while under the influence, 2002
Q: How do you describe how this season is going for you?
One is the cradle of hippiedom; the other is a major Navy port. (See stories online.) One is four times as densely occupied as the other, yet when it comes to hotels, they're almost dead even -- 226 in one city, 225 in the other.
Others were sick. But that didn't keep volunteers away. So many flocked to the agency, including one woman who drove up from Eugene, that Towers had to turn volunteers away. Hayes showed up and waited -- just like everyone else -- in the lobby. She was eager to take several pets but ended up with two cats and a dog.

"A lot of people kind of expect me to care about all these humanitarian problems, and I don't," he said, laughing. Open source is just "a wonderful way of doing things, and I think it's a lot more fun to do it this way than to be at a company and do programming the old-fashioned way."
"As the head coach, anything that happens within the framework of your team and your program you're responsible for," Payton said, encircled by reporters in the lobby of the posh Breakers hotel. "That's a lesson I learned. . . . It's easy to get carried away in regards to a certain side of the ball, or more involved offensively or defensively. And that's something that I regret."

2010 Ronco del Gnemiz Colli Orientali del Friuli Pinot Grigio ($26, 13.5%): Owner Serena Palazzolo is on an ambitious track in the Colli Orientali. Aged in steel, this is a fine, stately example of a much-maligned grape. Great textural depth bolsters its deep apple flavors, with notes of talc, peach pit, tarragon and sea salt. A very serious Grigio. (Importer: Vignaioli Selection)

Currently, the balance of power on the Clackamas River Water board is lopsided -- four commissioners on one side and Holloway on the other. The split developed not long after Holloway was elected in 2007 and keeps deepening. Bickering and snide comments between Holloway and other commissioners are common at board meetings.
"The Avengers" is essentially an extended action sequence interrupted by an extended soul-search in the middle. On board their invisible flying aircraft carrier known as the Helicarrier, our heroes, the agents of the covert S.H.I.E.L.D. peacekeeping club, keep breaking down into rivaling subgroups at the wily behest of Loki, who's like the most evil gym coach ever. Whedon's narrative task with "The Avengers"? Finding the best, most propulsive ways to pit Thor against Loki; the Hulk (wittily delayed in terms of the characters' Big Entrances) against Black Widow; Black Widow against the evil version of Hawkeye; and so forth.

“In recent years it’s been the toughest place for us to go play in the Pac,” York said. “It’s crazy down there. Any place that tries to throw batteries and Jack Daniel’s bottles at you when you’re coming out of the locker room, that’s kind of an intimidating place to go play sometimes.”

Players didn't appear as rigid as they did after Frank and Jamie McCourt filed for divorce or when the Dodgers were taken into bankruptcy. About the only times they chose their words carefully was when asked how their next boss, a Hall of Fame player for the Lakers, compared with Jordan as a basketball player.
That issues is actually fairly complicated because, at this point, sales taxes on SSBs don't reach some of the poorest and most obesity-prone members of our society: those who rely on SNAP (or food stamps) for their beverage purchases.

It is important to hang the wallpaper plumb. If you fail to do this, most patterns on the wallpaper will scream that you made a mistake when you look at where the wallpaper hits the ceiling. The pattern will run uphill or downhill. The wallpaper needs to be replumbed each time you come out of an inside corner. Always make a faint pencil line about 1/8 inch away from the edge of the wallpaper, and hold the wallpaper consistently away from the line. If you place the edge of the wallpaper on the pencil line and the seam between the two pieces of paper pulls away the slightest amount, you will see the ugly gray line between the two pieces.

A February report blasted the 14-month tenure of Cynthia Stroum, a big Obama donor who became ambassador to Luxembourg. It described her service as fraught with personality conflicts, verbal abuse and questionable expenditures on travel, wine and liquor. Things were so bad in the wealthy European nation that some staff requested transfers to Iraq and Afghanistan, the report said. Stroum resigned effective Jan. 31, just days before the scathing assessment was made public.

In the morning we are in a better frame of mind to assess the hotel and its amenities. We've ended up in a handsome suite with a tiny kitchen facility and a living room decorated with furniture that screams Ikea. The bedroom is similarly appointed, and both rooms have the requisite flat-screen TV. The view includes a large courtyard blessed with a smattering of brilliantly green trees and a bar and restaurant with a spectacular sound system. On this morning, the cleaning crew listens to the disembodied voice of a DJ declaring "Michael Jackson is not dead" as a segue to "Billie Jean."

"We sat down as a department and went through the scenarios," he said. "What if there is a tornado and we have to mobilize 100 officers quickly? Are they going to have to say, 'Sorry, Sarge, I had a drink at dinner a few hours ago so I can't come in'?"

I was doing an internship in Caracas as part of an MBA program, and the six-mile drive to work took anywhere from 15 minutes to more than an hour, depending on traffic. Although the Autopista Francisco Fajardo was built for four lanes, cars managed to form six lanes during rush hour, using every bit of roadway, including the shoulder. The lines painted on the highway were purely decorative and generally ignored.

I loved the idea of a slow-poached chicken breast ($24.50), but it had a thick sauteed crust, rendering the interior flesh too dry. However, I consoled myself with the surrounding pile of gigande and runner beans with pearl onions, a red wine sauce and sauteed escarole. Crispy pork confit ($23) - not as crisp as advertised and also a little dry - was saved by the underlying bed of kale, meaty sauce and roasted fingerling potatoes.

Its much easier to manage a game than manage a 162-game season. Thats why managers have to make calls like Leyland did with Valverde and Benoit and stick with them.

Growing up, I ate my share of frozen and store-bought pizza on Friday nights when we weren't having fish sticks. But my first pizza from a pizzeria came from Angelo's Pizza on Detroit Road in Lakewood, across from the Detroit movie theater. It was 1965, and I had just seen the film "Von Ryan's Express" with my dad. Frank Sinatra plays a World War II prisoner of war who puts together a plan for escape. After the movie, we picked up pizza from Angelo's with Italian sausage on it. I thought I had died and gone to heaven.

Mosaic never claims any affinity for local provision, but it still struck me as a little strange to have honeydew and watermelon, albeit in compressed form, in late autumn. My only other objection to the menu was a lack of imagination shown by offering mundane cheeses as part of a cheese plate and by offering raw ahi tuna at all.

ROSELAND — Essex County officials invite the public to its seventh annual Earth Day Celebration on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Essex County Environmental Center.
At the time, Dwek was already secretly cooperating with the federal government.
Also on display have been Japan's unrelenting politeness and its love for group consensus. Twitter users told stories about the stranded and the homeless sharing rice balls. Travelers heading north reported 10-hour car rides -- with no honking. At a convenience store in one battered coastal prefecture, a store manager used a private electric generator. When it stopped working and the cash register no longer opened, customers waiting in line returned their items to the shelves.
Doolittle will leave Congress in January. The race to replace him was so tight that elections officials aren't sure yet whether the winner is Republican state Sen. Tom McClintock, who vows to keep pushing for a dam, or Democrat and Air Force veteran Charlie Brown, who opposes it.
The Mississippi Avenue Lofts is one of at least a dozen Portland buildings launched since 2005 caught up in the spectacularly messy meltdown of Lake Oswego general contractor Gray Purcell Inc. Developers of buildings from North Portland to Goose Hollow to the Central Eastside saw their projects go grossly over budget and fall months behind schedule under Purcell's oversight.
I agree with those who say Blackmon isn't the prototype No. 1 wideout. But here are the names of the seven wide receivers on the Rams' roster: Danny Amendola, Danario Alexander, Brandon Gibson, Steve Smith, Austin Pettis, Greg Salas and Dominique Curry.

A lot of people want to move past race in this country. Who doesn't? It's a noble idea. But there seems to be this notion that just because we have a black man in the White House, everything is equal now. And maybe that's part of what has happened as Illinois stumbled through the hiring process: Because we're in a ‘‘post-racial'' moment in our history, perhaps the Illini got a little lazy. They took a stab at a black coach or three and gave up. Skin color doesn't matter anymore, right?
The worst place in America right now is the NBA's Southwest Division.
If the court rules that the Constitution does not allow for insurance mandates, will that effectively end the Affordable Care Act?
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- For years, Cuyahoga County Treasurer Jim Rokakis paid eight county employees full-time salaries to open envelopes and scan tax payments -- a practice that his successor calls inefficient.
All-star movie gatherings can be forced and clunky, with filmmakers trying too hard to make everyone relevant. Whedon figured out a way to make this one flow, and it's only the second film he's directed, following "Serenity" in 2005. The dude has a bright future. His script manages to achieve a precarious balance: taming the absurdity of being a superhero, while still embracing the fantasies of possessing superpowers.
'I want to kill him'
Shea, Christina. Larry Agran's chief nemesis on the City Council and Great Park board. If not for her willingness to speak out, he would pretty much go unchallenged on the dais. Kinda cute in a Sandra Dee kinda way.

No one has accused CME of doing anything wrong, although there are victimized traders who will go to their graves insisting the CME, as MF Global's lead regulator, had lax standards for the large trading customer. CME is a for-profit company and a market police officer, and regulators wonder if those roles are in conflict.
Art Spiegelman has been here before. At 63, dressed in black jeans, a denim shirt and that ubiquitous vest, he is talking, again, about his graphic memoir "Maus," the saga of his father Vladek's experiences during the Holocaust and of Spiegelman's efforts to get to know that father — to inhabit his story, if you will.

There is quite a bit of Prague in Portland, however, and tifo organizers here say overseas displays have influenced their own. But it took a breakthrough with club management to unleash the city's tifo potential.
Edwards contends that despite the cuts, improvements in protocol have helped CPS stay on top of cases. The agency uses a decision-making process that requires social workers to answer key questions about an incident, the child and the family. A team of managers and social workers reviews decisions in critical cases.
What's hot: The book is loaded with photos, so you'll never confuse mackerel and minnows -- and you'll wonder how anyone ever decided that sea monster-like monkfish might be worth trying.

For 22 years, the Olathe-based Elves have made the holidays a little brighter for suffering families around Christmas. But summertime is more difficult. The elves talked about pooling their personal frequent travel miles and started calling hotels about discounted rooms for the family.
Now, you might complain that Mr. Limbaugh is a much bigger deal than Hilary Rosen -- and that's true. Mr. Limbaugh is vastly more influential and important than Ms. Rosen. But he's also not a professional Republican like Ms. Rosen is for Democrats (if you actually listened to Mr. Limbaugh's show, you'd know that). She's visited the White House some 35 times and is a business partner with Anita Dunn, the former White House communications director.
"We have no antiques at all in this house," said Pat.

"Those who believe that California is in decline will naturally shrink back from such a strenuous undertaking," the governor said. "I understand that feeling, but I don't share it, because I know this state and the spirit of the people who choose to live here."
That holds true in the Kansas City area, where life expectancies in Johnson County match those of Switzerland and Sweden, while those in Wyandotte County are more like what's found in Libya or Sri Lanka.

The needle will, indeed, function as a broadcast antenna. It is described on the Port Authority's website as an antenna. On the other hand, the structure will have more meat to it than your average antenna, with external cladding encasing the broadcast mast.
Voters will decide.
My two cents on James gaining weight is this: Even if he is a step slower, it was worth it. What stood out to me the most in Arizona wasn't James average yards per carry -- it was the fact that as tacklers were trying to take him down, he made sure they knew how much stronger he was. At one point in the first half, LMJ lowered his head and bulldozed right over a much bigger defender into a crowd of teammates waiting on the sideline. He looked to be a sending a message, and I think Kenjon Barner put it perfectly when we talked afterward: "Anytime the little guy can hit somebody," Barner said, "it definitely excites the team."
Proponents of Christie's plan, like Republican Sen. Jennifer Beck, said the revised target is "an extremely aggressive standard" but still realistic. She said Corzine's target was unattainable.

There is one blatant hole. Isaacson says in a follow-up email, "I didn't get him to talk about China" and the forbidding conditions in which Apple products are produced there. (Near the end of the book, Jobs does urge President Barack Obama to sponsor new training programs for American engineers, saying he employs 700,000 Chinese factory workers because only China can supply the 30,000 engineers he needs to supervise them.)
This insightful and moving documentary, which tells the stories of five victims of school bullying, should be required viewing for everyone ages 8 to 18. In fact, it wouldn't hurt to make it mandatory for parents, teachers and school officials as well. Why are these particular kids under attack? Most are shy or considered somehow different, making them victims of prejudice and ignorance. We get only fleeting glimpses of the bullies themselves, but we get a long and disturbing look at the lack of accountability that surrounds the bullying environment. "Bully" forces audiences to face actions that are unthinkable, inexcusable and excruciatingly sad. Rated PG-13; intense themes, language, disturbing content. 1 hour, 39 minutes. By Claudia Puig, USA Today.
District Attorney Jeff Rosen convinced the jury that Garcia paid $9,500 to arrange the murder because he was jealous that the woman he loved, a bartender at the restaurant, loved Achilli instead.

Place fareki in a large sieve. Place sieve over a bowl of cold water. Swish water around grain and drain well. Heat a heavy-bottomed 8-inch pan about 2 inches deep over medium heat. Add the oil, stir in the fareki, and saute for several minutes. The grain should be toasted, but not burned. Stir in the garlic, shallots and warm stock. Bring to boil and reduce to slow simmer and cover. Simmer covered for 35-45 minutes, adding a little more stock if fareki becomes too dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste and stir in chives before serving.
"You know that if you don't leave this time, perhaps in the short term they won't dare to do anything, but the revenge will be very terrible. It is not as simple as four years' imprisonment or house arrest for 2 1/2 years. Their torture will be very frightening, very unbearable. ... The government hates you. ... We understand very well that you don't want to leave. You would like to stay and try to do something. But you have to understand that you will not be able to do anything if you stayed. ... You've already done so many things and made so many sacrifices for China's human rights and freedom. We all don't want to see you make even more sacrifices."

Korean restaurants generally are not big on desserts, and what they do have require more of an acquired taste. But if you have a hankering for a little something sweet at the end of the meal, get the tropical snow, a shaved coconut ice mountain crowned with red bean paste and jellied fruit.

Investors were cautious ahead of an inflation report in China. Traders speculated that the report, due Thursday, could show that prices are rising quickly as the economy there continues to grow at a fast pace. If prices jump, the Chinese central bank might boost raise interest rates. The concern is that higher rates in China would mean a slowdown in the global recovery.

I'm going to cut a worthy dragon some slack. "Eragon," the screen version of Christopher Paolini's novel, isn't likely to be mistaken for a Lucas-less episode of "Star Wars," even though the teenage dragon rider of the title (played by newcomer Ed Speleers) saves his kingdom in the fashion of Luke Skywalker, and Eragon's mentor, Brom, played with fragrant mournfulness by Jeremy Irons, has filched the wisdom of the ages from Obi-Wan's play book. But the star of this fantasy adventure for young audiences is a charmer from the moment she is hatched (from a huge blue egg that starts to rock like a Mexican jumping bean).

On our first leg, we slogged our way through traffic in Miami to connect with U.S. 1 about 50 miles south. A wiser choice would have been to spend the extra few bucks and cruise toward the islands on Florida's Turnpike.

I think it's a very important pipeline. The output of the oil sands is now equivalent to the Libyan exports before the civil war. It's a big number. It could double by the next decade.
