put together a very entertaining program. No big names? No need; St. Louis performers entertained each other in high style. The show opened with a twist on "Good Morning, Baltimore" from "Hairspray" (which was to emerge as the Muny's big winner).

After a strong workout and soul-jarring church service, I wasn't going to be tempted to eat hot dogs, nachos, popcorn, pretzels or drink pop at the Monsters game that afternoon.

The Newark-based Education Law Center, which brought the lawsuit against the state, argued that the cuts violated the state's constitutional requirement to provide a "thorough and efficient system of free public schools." In response, the Christie administration said the state doesn't have enough money to spend more on schools and argued that the court should not inject itself into the budget-making process. Conservatives including Christie have fiercely criticized the court's actions over the years, saying justices have mistakenly treated more funding as a cure-all for poor districts' education woes.

The Thunder (46-17) shot 53.3 percent, becoming the fourth team in five games to shoot at least 50 percent against the Kings. The team that didn't was the Thunder on April 13 in Oklahoma City. That wasn't a factor as the Thunder won by 26.

Although you can’t offer any solutions that work for your wife, you do see a number of alternatives that work for you: not having kids, having no kids, remaining childless. There is one other alternative: Getting divorced so your wife can try to find a man who’s interested in being a dad…as dim a prospect as that may be for a fertility-challenged 40-year-old woman competing with pert-breasted, fertility-iconish 20-somethings. Obviously, this option is not exactly the fast track to happily ever after. Then again, that’s probably not in the cards here unless you two can somehow find some wiggle room in how she “sees no purpose to life without children” and how you aren’t up for adopting anything you can’t pat on the head and leave tied to a chain-link fence.

There are many ways for schools to revamp their disciplinary rules. To start with, zero-tolerance policies should be reserved for the worst behaviors. For lesser violations, there should be an escalating series of disciplinary measures so that first-time offenders aren't treated like serial troublemakers. Ultimately, in-school suspension and detention make more sense than banning a student from campus. They keep students attending school regularly, prevent them from falling behind academically, keep them off possibly dangerous streets and send a message that misbehavior is not a free ticket to a few days off.

All three may still cling to the unlikely prospect that together they can siphon off enough delegate support in the remaining state contests to keep Mr. Romney from reaching the magic number of 1,144 votes required to be nominated.

Harding of the same state the Republican on the 10th roll call in the storied smoke-filled-room coup.

Despite Romney's optimism, free markets will never solve the problems Joyce faced. Health insurance for someone like Joyce, if obtainable, would cost thousands of dollars a year, and no free-market approach to healthcare will make that affordable to her. If universal coverage is the goal, there is no alternative to subsidies funded by employers and taxpayers. These subsidies — along with an individual mandate designed to bring younger, healthier people into the pool — form the basis for President Obama's healthcare plan. Those who call for "repealing and replacing" it should explain who would be covered by the "replacement" and how the care would be funded.

But reversing the new law's payment changes from one day to the next would be a huge legal and logistical challenge and raise many questions.

A small clarification to Therese Dyer's Letter to the Editor last week: I did not say that I could understand the reason for her recall campaign; I said I could understand the anger and frustration that motivated it. The recall itself seems an irrational, unnecessary, perhaps even vengeful response to those exasperations.

American audiences getting stupider? No, what I’m saying — well, hoping — is that there’s always been an audience for intelligent films, and there always will be. And that "surprise" successes like last year’s "The King’s Speech" or this year’s "Midnight in Paris" are surprises only to people who don’t realize that.

THOMAS: The state statute doesn't specifically require that landlords ask that tenants demonstrate proof of occupancy eligibility. Landlords must also be careful of discriminating against a future tenant under federal law. The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to "refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin." The FHA has been interpreted to prevent landlords from even seeking information about prospective tenants' national origin. A landlord may find it difficult to navigate between lawfully determining an individual's immigration status and discriminating based on national origin status.

NBA and NHL suits pay lip service to your needs. They really don't care about you being "inconvenienced," nor should they. Their fan constituency is much broader than the metropolitan area. And as far as we know, there's never been a study on how many Knicks fans desperately want to see the Rangers play or vice versa.

I've always enjoyed these pizzas and I probably always will. My favorite, if I had to choose, is the sausage, then the pesto and, more than ever, this vegetable extravaganza of zucchini, cauliflower, broccoli, spinach and, yes, the artichoke hearts Zelda Breslin absolutely refused to have at her pizzeria. Linda's also is doing a Canadian bacon and pineapple pizza, which Zelda would never have endorsed.

Derek Jeter 6
Its funny. Watching the game, I didnt for one second think twice about Leylands move. It wasnt "over-managing." If anything, it was "under-managing." It was straight textbook baseball. Your ace goes eight innings and then your closer finishes it out. If Leyland had a game plan before the first pitch, it would have read almost exactly like that.

And here's the thing: Phillip Phillips had what might have been the best performance of his season a little bit before them, with an understated but no less effective rendition of Damien Rice's Volcano.

However, slot manufacturers do produce RNGs that will lead to different long-term percentages on the same type of machine, and it's up to the purchasing casino to choose which they want installed.
Whatever he’s doing, it’s a lot of fun to watch. It helps that Salem doesn’t take himself too seriously, unlike such previous practitioners of his art as Uri Geller. He joyously tosses off bad puns with abandon: Attempting to identify an audience member’s yarmulke while blindfolded, he asks with mock innocence, “Is this a motorcycle? Because I was getting Yamaha.”
A week before his death, Diersen appeared relatively healthy and attended a wedding, his family said. Simonett said family members live with questions about whether they should have taken him for a follow-up doctor visit; they didn't because he showed few signs of illness apart from congestion and coughing.

W.S. Merwin's friendship with late Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz began in the 1960s when Merwin first introduced Milosz and fellow Pole Zbigniew Herbert to an audience at a poetry event in New York City. That early meeting was the start of a relationship that flourished over nearly 40 years. Merwin visited Southern California earlier this month to attend the Milosz Centenary Festival at Claremont McKenna College. Over the years, this festival — organized by the Family of Benjamin Z. Gould Center for Humanistic Studies and its director, professor Robert Faggen, a friend of Milosz's — has brought an array of distinguished writers to campus to discuss the legacy of the poet, who died in 2004. Past participants have included Seamus Heaney and Robert Hass; this year's guests included Robert Pinsky, C.K. Williams, Afar Nafisi, Adam Michnik, Meghan O'Rourke and many others, including Merwin.

According to the Gospel of John, just after Jesus' entrance into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, some Gentiles came to see him. They share no reason for wanting to see him, so we can only imagine. Perhaps they were yearning for a "do over," in life, looking for some way to shake things up and start all over. For whatever reason, they come looking for Jesus. They have connections: someone knows a guy who knows a guy, who knows another guy who happens to know Jesus' disciples Philip and Andrew.
Throughout history, the mentally disabled had been helped by shamans and healers of all kinds, with mixed results. This hospital hoped to offer new promise, symbolizing the new ideas about curing mental illness emerging in the century that produced Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and Founding Father Benjamin Rush, of Philadelphia, called "the father of American psychiatry."

6:12 p.m. -- GIANTS 24, CARDINALS 12. Was that a breastroke by FB Madison Hedgecock in the end zone?! Well, whatever it was, who can blame him for being pretty darn excited after he scored his first NFL TD on a 2-yard catch. Last week, he joked he was pretty jealous when TE Darcy Johnson got his first score, so Hedgecock countered quickly.
I shared his story a month ago, when he'd just accepted a contract on his home in Lutherville-Timonium after only six days on the market.

What does it take to get a bribery conviction in Maryland? State Sen. Ulysses Currie, who took a quarter-million dollars from a grocery store chain to advocate on its behalf, and who told no one about the arrangement, was just found not guilty on several counts of bribery by a federal jury in Baltimore. Apparently, corrupt public officials need not take paper bags of cash under the table anymore; they can just get their lucre by direct deposit. If this is to become the new standard in Maryland, a lot of lobbyists are about to be out of a job. Why bother hiring them when corporations can simply put lawmakers on the payroll?

Amy Zupanci probably reached too high when she opened Fond a few years ago, and she couldn't have anticipated the duration of the poor economy. But she left behind a lovely space along a quintessential American Main Street.

And by current standards, ideological differences between the presidential candidates were muted in 2000. Al Gore and George W.

Halfway up the road, I killed the ignition and stepped outside. Judging by out-of-state plates in the driveways, most of the homes belonged to summer residents. Although they were upscale, the homes had the rustic touches you wouldn't find in Malibu or Miami Beach: faded shingles, rusty barbecues, orphaned canoe oars.
As part of the renovations, Macy's will create the world's largest shoe department, featuring as many as 300,000 pairs of shoes on any one day, and infuse technology into the shopping experience ranging from interactive store directories to a new mobile app to guide customers as they shop.
