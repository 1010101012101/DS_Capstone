One is an increase in the personal income tax exemption. It now stands at $2,000, which means for every person in a household $2,000 is exempt from state taxes. The new legislation would raise that to $2,050 and require it to rise each year with the rate of inflation.

The panels -- called building-integrated photovoltaics, or BIPVs -- could replace boxy solar panels that are made with rigid glass or silicon and mounted on thick metal frames. The flexible solar shingles would be less expensive to install than current panels, and made to last 25 years.
"That's just who we are," Sheik says.
Bowden, like close friend Justin Masterson before him, needed a change of scenery but didn’t really want one. He told me in the spring of 2011 that it would mean more to him to make it with Boston than elsewhere, but amended that in February to say he’d be thrilled to be reunited with Epstein. That’s happened, and Dale Sveum says he’ll look to him in the middle innings when he needs out. Jeff Samardzija was in that role for the Cubs last season and elevated his profile significantly. Bowden doesn’t throw as hard as Samardzija but he’s mentally tough and he’s a pro. He’ll also get to sleep in his own bed, which he has not done often while chasing his dream with the Red Sox.
WBBM also is making headway in holding on to more of its lead-in, which was a 7.4 in February. But the station's late news rating still needs to match or beat its lead-in number for management to declare a major victory.

Cherokee also was spearheading the redevelopment of the Cramer Hill development in the city of Camden. Cherokee proposed a $1.2 billion plan centered around a golf course, which would replace an unused municipal landfill, according to Camden After the Fall, a book about development in the city.

“The only thing I can think of, why you're not coming out, is that someone else was involved,” Det. Gary Cortellino tells Neuman on a video played for the jury. “I think it includes someone else,” the detective says, mentioning Rusty Sneiderman’s widow by name.
First and foremost, I feel that the smartest move the Browns can make in free agency this year is retaining Peyton Hillis. That is, as always, if the price is right. It’s true that last season Hillis was plagued by injuries and was generally unproductive. But I’m still not buying into the manufactured controversy. It’s also not worth ignoring the potential that we saw the year before. Even by the end of the season we saw his return to form, at least against the Ravens in Week 16. With a full recovery and without the target on his back coming from the Madden cover, I still think Hillis can be the running back that the Browns' offense needs him to be. He fits the system and if the front office can come to terms, I think he wants to be here.

Reporting from Washington -- The Obama administration is asking the Supreme Court to allow a 43-foot-tall cross that serves as a war memorial to remain atop Mt. Soledad in San Diego, arguing that the cross has been there since 1954 and is not an endorsement of religion.
Normally, Chara is our best player, or the least replaceable, who does many things which never show up in stats. Last night he was not his usual self, maybe because he was positioned wrongly. Marcelin lost the ball leading to the final score. Palmer and Wallace are liabilities defensively; this is why they became expendable in Houston and DC. But I do believe that they are useful outside midfielders.

“It’s encouraging,” James Swanson, who oversees about $250 billion as chief investment strategist at Boston-based MFS Investment Management, said in a phone interview. “The earnings season shows that companies can have good profitability in a low growth environment. In a yield starved world, with the Fed keeping rates on hold, the stock market is the place for people to find earnings and dividend yields. As long as these earnings hold up, I’d say that’s a bright sign for the market.”

This was unfinished business that gave Gary Pinkel his first coaching victory over Texas after five previous losses. This was a great bounce back after last week's embarrassing loss at Baylor in which the Mizzou defense gave up nearly 700 yards and 42 points. It was a big deal because the Tigers defense limited Texas (6-3, 3-3 in the Big 12) to 76 yards rushing and 171 yards passing and no touchdowns.
Apodaca isn't the one falling behind in counts or failing to execute breaking pitches. It's hardly his fault that Jeremy Guthrie popped a chain on his bike, creating a gaping hole in the staff. And Apodaca would look a lot smarter if Jorge De La Rosa were anchoring the staff.

Think carefully before choosing the 16 gigabyte model, though. Magazines, picture books, movies and apps that take advantage of the Retina display require visual elements with four times as many pixels. This fact doesn't kill the entry-level model, I should stress. But it does redefine it. A 16 gig iPad can carry just the stuff you've decided you immediately need. With 64 or 32 gigabytes of available storage, you'll have greater agility.

The most decadent event was the tasting/pairing of nine wines, from unoaked Chardonnay to raspberry wine and icewine with mounds of French milk and dark chocolates.

It was an election that failed to hint at the turmoil to come. Once inaugurated, Walker almost immediately joined with Republicans who had also retaken control of the Legislature to strip most state workers of their collective bargaining rights.

"Players are responsible for what they put in their bodies," Mota's agent, Adam Katz, said in a statement.

After a day at the temples, I like to head to Nishiki Market, a wonderful little world of inexpensive thrills in an expensive city. The narrow, covered arcade with stalls that sell everything - a variety of seaweed, dried fish with the heads still on, soy doughnuts, octopus balls, dozens of varieties of saki (the very best are cold), roasted coarse green tea, incense, candles, Hello Kitty dolls, kimonos, some kind of huge vegetable slathered in a brown paste, the traditional Kyoto gelatinous Warabi mochi bean cakes, kitchen utensils and daito, a kind of pickled radish.

Because the organization gives several awards in two movie categories -- drama and musical or comedy -- its batting average is deceptively high.

Notes: Based on The Greatest Gift, a short story by Philip Van Doren Stern, the movie is among the most popular of all time. But it was a box-office bust and fizzled at the Oscars.

You can sow crimson clover and Austrian field peas throughout fall, but they perform best if sown by the end of October -- late September to early October is ideal -- so they get off to an earlier start before the real cold of winter sets in. Then just dig the crop into the soil in spring before the plants set seed. I like to cut them down when the stems are still crisp so they're easier to cut and dig in. My cover crops are usually about 24 inches tall by then.

P.S.: The evening's showstopper came at the reception, when electronic music began playing and four people, then eight, then more and more, until finally 65 participants from Rhythm & Motion were dancing in a flash mob.

Mackie is the mastermind behind the elaborate finale, in which all 85 performers appear in his costumes. Among a medley of songs is Cole Porter's "Begin the Beguine," which was introduced 75 years ago on Broadway in a musical about European royalty. Its name, coincidentally, is "Jubilee."
I believe part of your problem is European bureaucracy, under which everyone has a carefully defined role to play. The loyalty desk couldn't help you because they can only help with award redemption. Accor's help desk must defer to the hotel because it's a nonrefundable, pre-paid rate -- and so forth. Having spent the first 16 years of my life in Europe, I can certainly understand the hotel's point of view. But it makes no sense for the customer.

Among the more interesting tales of Kenilworth’s movie days are those offered by the late Michael Wojcio (1912-2010). During a 2009 interview he talked of two incidents where he viewed movie sets here in Kenilworth. Mike said, “A friend said to me, ‘Do you want to see a real Indian?’ I said, ‘Yeah!’” The boys went to Galloping Hill and peered through the brush and saw a teepee. Mike stated, “The flap of the tent opened up and here comes a Indian steppin’ out, then another one and they had beads around their clothes and feathers stickin’ up.” He told how he and his friend left silently only to return another day. Mike told of that second visit. “Nobody was there. So we went up close. You know what? It was a fake tent! It just had a front with a flap in it with some sticks up there. We was fooled. I said, ‘What the heck; what are they doing takin’ movies or sum’tin’?’ That’s what it was. They were takin’ pictures there.”

Fact: Community colleges have low graduation rates. And even when we account for transfer students (which we should), far less than half of full-time degree/certificate seeking-students will complete their programs. Success rates -- including both completion and transfer -- for part-time students are far lower, as are success rates for students with remedial needs. Yes, it is far harder to get a student in a community college across the finish line than it is to get a student at Harvard to graduate, but there is substantial variation across community colleges in how well they succeed with their students -- and far too many community colleges fail with far too many of their students.

At the same time, the neurologists acknowledged that, with parent and volunteer coaches on the sidelines of many games, the decision to bench a potentially injured athlete is left in inexpert hands. Even where there is a strong desire to protect youthful players, there are few tools available to help identify which kids need to be sent to the bench, they noted. Though the military's screening tool is considered quite reliable, it's too long and complex to be a practical guide on the sidelines.

Before becoming vegan, I was a big fan of Greek orzo salad because of the tanginess that feta cheese brought as a finishing touch. So I got excited last year when I discovered a new Portland company called Heidi Ho Organics, which makes a soy-based feta-style crumble that gets its zing from white wine vinegar and a splash of balsamic. It's great sprinkled on garden salads or as an addition to sandwiches, but it's perfect for veganized orzo salad loaded with enough kalamata olives, pine nuts and tomatoes to take you on a virtual trip to Athens.

March 8 -- Ohio State announces at a news conference that it discovered Tressel's major NCAA violations while checking his emails in January on another matter and is self-reporting them to the NCAA. The news conference with Tressel, Smith and OSU President Gordon Gee is generally viewed as poorly handled, with Gee's joke about Tressel's job status -- "I'm just hoping the coach doesn't dismiss me" -- serving to hover over the rest of this situation. Tressel is fined $250,000 and suspended for two games by Ohio State.

(2) He signed a $240 million deal with the Angels, and the free-agent defection only intensified the scrutiny. At the time Pujols signed, many wondered if the Angels screwed up in giving him a 10-year contract. That means Pujols will be monitored more closely than other players. It happens to all superstars that sign a mega deal. (3) In St. Louis and beyond, there's interest in how Pujols would do after leaving a place where he was happy and comfortable and thriving in an ideal setting for him, on and off the field.

Written over a period of 50 years, these stories reveal a great deal about a writer best known for her novels. Organized chronologically by publication year, from 1964 to 2000, the 14 stories describe (clearly without Margaret Drabble's intention to do so) three phases of a woman's life: youth, middle age and old age. In the first few stories, like "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" (written when the author was at Cambridge, but not published until 1968 after her reputation was established), we see young characters on the outside of social situations looking in — a position every writer must establish early in his or her writing life. We see Drabble honing her powerful eye for details and their meanings. A narrator regards a newlywed couple on their honeymoon in "Hassan's Tower" with painstaking attention — every decision, every pause, every trace of emptiness.

I'll admit, I wasn't entirely impressed with the drink selection. Although Ivy is certainly well-stocked, the variety is weighted toward the average club-goer, so you see the expected wealth of flavored vodkas and rums, as well as some premium tequilas and the odd scotch or gin. The beer menu is also comprised of the usual suspects: popular domestics and a few green-bottled Dutch and German imports. This is not at all a bad thing — if you're heading to the Kennedy for a night of dancing and reverie, you're probably not in a hurry to fill up on imperial IPAs or Rob Roys.

State and federal laws ban the sale of marijuana, but Oregon allows medical marijuana growers to recoup the costs of supplies and utilities. But no one in authority checks those prices. Many law enforcement officials readily acknowledge they don't have a clear idea of what's taking place inside the state's marijuana resource centers, collectives, co-ops, clubs and cafes. They don't know how much marijuana or cash moves through these businesses. They aren't subject to regulation or inspection. The pot doesn't have to be checked for quality and it's not taxed.

As a parent and ex-teacher, I am dismayed how complacent other parents seem to be with Parkway's budget cuts. The Parkway School Board is like our U.S. Congress, taking the easy way out by cutting staff. Why not cut two choices of the five or six lunch offers at the high school? Why not condense some of the half-empty school buses? Instead, there will not be a specialist for every school next year - just schools with the greatest needs. They plan to establish instructional coach positions to replace specialists. Their plan to eliminate class-size limits is frightening. I believe parents should have a right to contribute to these discussions. We may not be in the meeting room; however, we can call, we can write, we can help find better solutions other than cutting our educators. That will only hurt our children.

Despite his message of fiscal restraint, the senator’s long record in Trenton carries at least one potential liability. In 1997, he voted in favor of Gov. Christie Whitman’s proposal to issue $2.75 billion in pension bonds, which many analysts say led to the state’s huge pension debt.

The problem was, the whole thing was fake, according to the FTC.

Deputy District Attorney Alex Karkanen, who works with the auto-theft task force, said the county has prosecuted scores of similar bait-car cases and never encountered such problems.

By embracing the treasure hunt, dollar stores have been able to keep the middle-income shoppers they attracted during the recession.

Counter to the stereotypical image of private colleges, Oregon's independent institutions are not reserved for the privileged. Nor do they exist solely to serve the majority. Quite to the contrary, an education at one of Oregon's independent colleges or universities is available to all those with the ability to benefit from the experience -- not just to an elite few. Twenty-eight percent of the students at independent institutions are from low-income households (eligible for Pell Grants), and 90 percent of their degree-seeking undergraduates receive financial aid. The average debt load for graduating students (a major concern for all of us) is comparable to that of students graduating from our public institutions.

The annual budget debate in Congress plays out on an arcane battlefield of numbers and assumptions, often difficult to understand even by Capitol Hill veterans. Basically, however, the so-called budget resolution sets broad parameters for follow-up legislation. Sometimes that is just a round of agency budget bills; other times lawmakers take on taxes and benefit programs like Medicare whose budgets otherwise run on autopilot.
It's a patently bad idea. The state would be hard-pressed to achieve the efficiencies and flexibility offered by the highly competent regional administration of these taxes in Northeast Ohio. And if the real intent is to make this the first prong of a state assault on the ability of Ohio municipalities to levy income taxes at all, or to force smaller towns and villages out of existence, then it's a nonstarter.

It denigrates the efforts of thousands of men and women who are dedicating their lives to protecting that border. It facilitates very much an anti-immigrant fervor that again is not helpful. We know that the underlying immigration law needs to be updated. And it's hard to address that rationally and logically when what everybody's hearing that somehow or other we've gone backward on the border as opposed to we've made significant progress and are building on the efforts of those who came before us.
