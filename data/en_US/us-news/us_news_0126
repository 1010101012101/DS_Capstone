The questions about Coples arose his senior year at North Carolina, when he was moved to right defensive end after exploding at left defensive tackle as a junior. His production dipped to 7.5 sacks, and the knock on him was that he lacked a consistent motor. Before the draft, Coples said the most common question he was asked was, “Do you love football?”
Kadafi himself blamed his government for corruption but it was largely seen as posturing.
Tayeh told jurors he knew Sowell well. He knew his behaviors, his patterns, his girlfriends – even the brand of beer he preferred. And he recognized when Sowell’s behavior and personality had taken a dark turn.

"There were complaints about corruption amongst senior officials in the military. There were some complaints about favoritism in the army and the way soldiers were chosen to go to fight in the north."
Indeed, the list of Islamophobic acts is long and getting longer. In August, a mosque construction site in Tennessee was torched and shot at, as was a small-town mosque in western New York. Also in August, a Muslim New York City cab driver was knifed in what police are calling a hate crime. A Florida church plans to burn Qurans on Sept. 11.

And the billions the state has spent on property tax rebate checks this decade would have been freed up for other needs if the cap had been in place. Money could have gone to schools and municipalities — two areas Christie also wants to cut this year, which could lead to layoffs of teachers, police officers and other public employees.

There have always been conflicting laws, customs and practices in Afghanistan regarding the treatment of women. But after the Taliban regime was routed by the United States in 2001, the country adopted a constitution that prohibits discrimination against women. In 2002, it also ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women -- the primary international treaty safeguarding women's rights -- agreeing to repeal or reform laws that discriminate against them. These commitments to equality seemed to bring Afghanistan into the 21st century; the new law is a contradiction of them and a repudiation of progress.
The president's allies are locked in a power struggle with even more conservative factions that question Ahmadinejad's loyalty to Iran's clerical leadership. Each side hoped to triumph Friday and be well-positioned for the presidential election scheduled for 2013, when Ahmadinejad's second and final term ends.

Maybe the arena obsession is what allowed city leaders to emerge from an Orlando hotel conference room a month ago proclaiming an arena deal with just a few I's to dot and T's to cross.
Talk-show hosts get famous by loudly expressing their opinions, and Internet technology enables anybody with a computer to write their own spin of the news and pass it off as truth. Even traditional media venues are changing to allow more news analysis (opinions) to augment the reporting of facts, and all sorts of polls and comment lines encourage people to "Sound Off!" As I recently heard it said, Americans today want affirmation, not information.

South Korea is agreeing to allow the U.S. to lift a 2.5 percent tariff on Korean cars in five years, instead of cutting the tariff immediately. The agreement also allows each U.S. automaker to export 25,000 cars to South Korea as long as they meet U.S. federal safety standards and allows the U.S. to continue a 25 percent tariff on trucks for eight years and then phase it out by the 10th year. South Korea would be required to eliminate its 10 percent tariff on U.S. trucks immediately.

Second, did you say you'd gone off-roading in your rental? Most car rental agreements forbid drivers from taking their cars on an unpaved road. Even if they don't, it's a good idea to stay away from dirt roads in a rental car. The most common kind of car rental damage -- the chipped window -- can happen too easily when a car or truck in front of you kicks a pebble at you.

Grant, from an anti-slavery family in Ohio, rose to command the army that defeated the Confederacy. Julia Grant eventually embraced abolition.

“The main reason is that no one of the three entries received a majority, and thus after lengthy consideration, no prize was awarded,” said Sig Gissler, administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes. “There were multiple factors involved in these decisions, and we don't discuss in detail why a prize is given or not given.”
A. Christie, for starters. The governor is comfortable making decisions that may be unpopular, and he is not afraid of taking on giant unions like the New Jersey Education Association and the Communications Workers of America. Also on the winning side are Republican legislators who view this as the first step toward their goals. New Jersey residents would be winners if Christie’s cuts work without generating higher property taxes.
With Gibbs now securely in the fold, the next step for head coach Kevin Willard and his staff will be trying to get the point guard eligible for next season. Gibbs will reportedly try to seek a hardship waiver, which would allow him to not have to sit out a year, as per NCAA regulations. While hardship waivers are sparse and often times hard to come by, a member of the Gibbs family is reportedly dealing with an illness, which also was a reason he sought a transfer from Austin.

As Day 5 opened, I didn't want to get carried away, but I definitely felt lighter than I had four days' previous. And the waist seemed a bit smaller. I did 50 minutes of cardio, then 10 minutes of light weights. My motivation came from watching a commercial for a button that allows you to adjust your pant size to accommodate more (or less) girth. I focused on the more part and said I never want it to come to that for me. But I'm also the guy who, a couple years ago, bought pants that had extra stretch capability by virtue of a band inside the belt line.

The name of the break, Supertubos, says it all. France and Spain have been southwest Europe's key surfing spots, but Portugal has moved up in events and surfers. Tiago Pieres of Portugal made the World Tour this year, and Peniche was the surprise choice of last year's Rip Curl Search (which is going to Puerto Rico in 2010). Peniche dubs itself Capital da Onda, which means "capital of surf" in Portuguese. The event went so well that Rip Curl decided to return with a regular event this year. The ocean surge comes in directly to the west-facing beaches, creating waves of up to 15 feet when conditions are right. The wave is known to dramatically tube in a way that looks something like the Banzai Pipeline, leading Rip Curl to nickname it "The European Pipe." The event was popular with locals – crowds of up to 20,000 a day came out to watch the unusually large and undulating swells body-slam surfers, snap surfboards and puncture the eardrum of Australian Owen Wright.

We don't know if Molly Brown joined traveling companions John Jacob and Madeleine Astor in the exclusive a la carte restaurant or the larger first-class dining "saloon." But we can assume that after the multi-course dinner, she loosened her corset before lying down to read. "I stretched on the brass bed, at the side of which was a lamp. So completely absorbed in my reading I gave little thought to the crash that struck at my window overhead and threw me to the floor," she told the Newport Herald after the disaster.
Unfortunately, fairness won't determine the outcome of this debate. Politics will. The Missouri Legislature is involved, and the rivalry between Slay and Reed is heating up.
The next Blues event, suggested by someone on Anielski’s mailing list, will be a luncheon buffet at Peppermill Pub and Grille in April. The exact day has not been chosen. After that, Anielski said the group could expand to other businesses such as a florist, dry cleaner or independent hardware store, or other places in Northeast Ohio.
Lions Gate devotes 10-15 percent of its budget to online promotion, he said.

Last Sunday, after a courageous struggle, we lost Keeley Imel to brain cancer. I first came to know of Keeley the fall of 2010, when Karen Brelsford wrote a story about her.

Phones can't do everything well. Their small screens provide a paltry view compared to a PC or a tablet and are not nearly big enough to display an onscreen keyboard suitable for touch typing. Some say the iPad's virtual keyboard is adequate for word processing, but people I know who use it regularly to create documents typically use a case with a built-in physical keyboard. It's hard to know if things will evolve in this direction, but I wonder if hotels will someday all have wireless keyboards and the ability to use the flat-screen TV to view the output of our smartphones.
FitzGerald called in July for MetroHealth to award consulting contracts through competitive bidding and to improve transparency, ethical standards and contracting practices. The health system has made steps toward meeting those recommendations, officials said.

"I have heard mixed stories, not a whole lot of stories," said Gordon, vice chair of a committee that oversees inspections.

Now that Missouri is headed to the SEC next year, Kansas doesn't have to play the Tigers any longer. Obviously, Missouri wants to keep the series -- one that began way back in 1907 when James Naismith first took KU into Columbia -- going because wins against one of the most storied basketball programs will help with credibility and, more importantly, in recruiting.

Then again, and most importantly, Van Noten owns his company, an increasing rarity in luxury fashion today. In the last 20 years, most designer-run luxury brands have either listed on the stock market (like Ralph Lauren) or sold to corporate groups such as LVMH or Gucci Group or to private equity firms. Among the handful that remain independent are Giorgio Armani, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Oscar de la Renta and Sonia Rykiel.

That -- not nukes -- is the chief cause of the friction between the U.S. and Russia. You wouldn't know it to hear Obama in Moscow pledging to halt the "drift" in U.S.-Russian relations. Drift? The decline in relations came from Putin's desire to undo what he considers "the greatest geopolitical catastrophe" of the 20th century -- the collapse of the Soviet empire. Hence his squeezing Ukraine's energy supplies. His overt threats against Poland and the Czech Republic for daring to make sovereign agreements with the United States.

But a full printed score is big and bulky, inconvenient to lug around. And it tends to require constant and rapid page turning, a distraction. Enter the MacBook, whose screen comfortably accommodates all eight parts, and which allows a player to store many such "bulky" scores. The convenience factor is clear: no more page turning and not as much toting of suitcases filled with printed scores while on tour.

For many legislators, the purpose of being in Congress is not to pass laws. It's to create clear contrasts you can take into the next election campaign. It's not to take responsibility for the state of the country and make it better. It's to pass responsibility onto the other party and force them to take as many difficult votes as possible.

In 1958, the court said: "The (Eighth) Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society." Justice Antonin Scalia has warned: "A society that adopts a bill of rights is skeptical that 'evolving standards of decency' always 'mark progress,' and that societies always 'mature,' as opposed to rot." But even the "originalist" Scalia, although disposed to construe the Constitution's terms as they were understood when ratified, would today proscribe some late 18th-century punishments, such as public lashing and branding.

According to Canellos, the Southern District of New York is still the biggest player on the block. In fact, he said, in the last few years, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office has been on a huge run of successful economic-fraud prosecutions, as exemplified by the conviction of Raj Rajaratnam in the Galleon Group case, known widely as the largest insider-trading case in U.S. history.

In the 1960s, civics teachers (including me) had the duty of explaining the logic of redevelopment and the condemnation of private land for a "higher public use."

In a kitchen, Lewin says, "the main thing is to have a floor that will age well. With the black, the more it's scratched up, the more beautiful it looks. Being oak, it'll last 50 to 100 years.
Dessert was much better. Jackson Fillmore is one of the few places that still makes warm zabaglione ($6.25), and it was good, even if contained superfluous berry juice that didn't add anything. Tiramisu ($6.75) was as good as ever, and brought back memories of the better meals I've had there over the past couple of years. But even though dinner ended on a high note, there was no way to mask the low ones.

The beautiful Mabel (silvery voiced, New York-based actress Patricia Noonan), captures Frederic's attention immediately, and they are all set to wed until a discovery about his birthday requires him to return to the pirate ship for many more years.

Marley, whose father was a white Englishman he barely knew, had 11 children by seven women, according to the film. His daughter Cedella talks with insight and anguish about how her mother rationalized, and compartmentalized, Marley's notion of free love. It's soon apparent that the reggae icon was not the best of fathers, and Cedella (named after her grandmother, Marley's mother) speaks with rueful resignation about the lack of attention she received.

"When we started, only one or two other states were active with gourds," Niemeyer said. "Now almost every state has a gourd society and show, so people can stay closer to home."
Chet eventually retired and became part-owner of a soon-to-be-opened (in 1973) Big Sky Resort near Bozeman, Montana, with his birth-roots not far away. One time I was interviewing Chet on my Channel 5 SKI SCENE program and asked him if he missed the news business. He immediately stated, again verbatim, "Not at all. The news is coming in such big chunks these days, I'd be overwhelmed to try to know what to report". That was in early 1973. (Chet sadly passed away just three days before Big Sky opened that year.)
Despite the occasional glitch, I have a soft spot for Short Order's classic burgers (especially Nancy's backyard burger), those irresistible spuds and the fresh salads. The quality ingredients, full bar and short, sweet wine list add up to one classy burger joint. It's not perfect, but Amy Pressman would have been proud.

Public health officials have warned for years about the dangers of unpasteurized milk, which can become contaminated with harmful bacteria, especially E. coli O157:H7. In its most recent study, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said consumers are 150 times more likely to get sick from unpasteurized milk and cheese than pasteurized products. The Food and Drug Administration requires raw milk cheese to be aged 60 days, but it doesn't regulate raw milk. It's banned in 20 states, and 13 others, including Oregon, restrict sales.
"There's no incentive at all to find a place in the middle," Crayton said. "There will be talk of it, and I think the talk will be embraced by one or both sides as progress. But as far as actual policymaking, with the exception of very marginal elements, I suspect there won't be very much happening at all."
Though officials have been planning for the race for months and say they can hold hassles to a minimum, they also say the Grand Prix has been one of the most complicated events ever held in Baltimore. City and Maryland Transit Administration officials emphasize their experience with events that require multiple street closings. Every summer, for example, they cope with Artscape, which blocks off some streets for more than a week — and involves moving light rail trains through the thick of the crowd.
Ford's F-Series truck line was up 9 percent, thanks mainly to V-6 engines built in Brook Park.

Ford plans to add a third shift to the plant next month as it expands the use of the EcoBoost engine into more vehicles.

Consequently, when people with chronic conditions are referred to a physical therapist, there is tremendous variety in what you get. Usually, it's hot packs, ultrasound, manual therapy and a few ineffective exercises you're told to do at home. This approach rarely works for chronic conditions. Physical therapists must do a better job in providing more consistent, high-quality, exercise-based care and working with physicians so that proper referrals can be made.
Next, stare at the sidewalk. Not just because the New Yorkers all around you are doing so, but because there are dozens of bronze plaques with literary quotes set in the sidewalk on 41st Street near Madison Avenue. My favorite is from E.B. White: "I don't know which is more discouraging, literature or chickens."

Any set of tax incentives and disincentives designed to address our health crisis - and there is no question it is a deadly epidemic - would have to be independent of the need to shore up Illinois' budget.

Our next dish, duck confit over a parsnip puree, in a sauce of the duck's own juice and slivered almonds ($14), was less creative but just as tasty as the mozzarella. The salty duck played off the sweetness of the parsnips and almonds, with the nuts adding just a little crunch.

The Castro comments? Quite another matter. Forget about all of Guillen's feuds with Kenny Williams and his baseball-related controversies. This isn't the first time Ozzie has stepped into it politically. He has expressed his support for Hugo Chavez. (He's also been a vocal critic of Chavez.) And as Rick Telander pointed out, this isn't even the first time Guillen has expressed admiration for Castro's cockroach-like ability to stay alive and in power all these years.
Obama was not revisiting the issue of gay marriage either. In his weekly radio and Internet address, the president didn't mention his history-making endorsement. Instead, he repeated his call for congressional lawmakers to take up a "to-do list" of tax breaks, mortgage relief and other initiatives that he insists will create jobs and help middle-class families struggling in the sluggish economy.
A conviction that marriage is for life can be a beautiful, grounding, guiding belief. It can also be a cop-out, a retreat into "principle" to avoid the sheer terror of walking away from the only life you know.
Q: What about other medical conditions for which patients could benefit from medical marijuana?
I’m not a cynic. I’m more than happy to note that 203 of the 439 original Jackson scholars returned to Tri-C for their second year of school this semester. Hopefully, they will continue to take full advantage of the opportunity that so many of their peers have squandered.

I asked her, "Tomorrow, would you be kind enough to try a waltz instead of your broken gait?" She looked amused, as though saying, "I'll do it my way, thank you."
While the sales team defined mothers as those women with children, I saw a larger vision of motherhood as informed by my faith. Maybe a vision that goes beyond the definition as presented by the founder of Mother's Day. And one that escaped a customer in my store who refused my offer of a flower because, as she said, "I don't have children, so I am not a mother." I respected her position, but I felt sad because in my heart of heart I believe she is a mother.

Hewitt, the 1998 Division II Ohio Defensive Player of the Year when he played at Chardon, said Meyer is a motivator, and players did not want to let him down. "But there was also an element of fear with it, too. It was a great combination."
Zuckerman chose a palette of silver, gold, copper and bronze after being inspired by photos in a magazine. The fall wedding was held outdoors by a fireplace, where flickering candlelight and firelight competed to dance across gleaming décor that included gilded flower arrangements, mercury glass and gold, silver and bronze silk throw pillows. “I wanted to create a romantic, ethereal atmosphere,” Zuckerman said.
The Giants announced yesterday that Lawrence Tynes, who missed three field goals in the fourth quarter and overtime of their 23-20 loss in the NFC title game to the Green Bay Packers, would not be re-signed. “We just feel like we need to go in another direction with our kicker,” GM Jerry Reese said.
It lost $256 million in Europe, after breaking even in that region a year ago. The loss was an improvement, however, from the $562 million it lost there in the fourth quarter, though GM's chief financial officer, Daniel Ammann, said it is "too hard to say" whether the worst for Europe has passed.

Then as now, there's not much to Belmont. In November 1861, it was a hamlet across the river from Columbus, Ky. Today, it's a gravel lane to a towboat dock. The battlefield is farmland, unreachable without trespass.
Play is one more piece of the 2011-12 Rialto season clicking to place as up-and-running productions lose steam in the post-holiday slump. "Peter" snatches up its spot from "Relatively Speaking," the trio of one-acts by Woody Allen, Ethan Coen and Elaine May that has recently seen sales dwindle despite healthy early frames.
Springfield Sacred Heart-Griffin and Galesburg each shot 356, with Sacred Heart-Griffin claiming the sectional title on a fifth-score tiebreaker. Althoff shot 362 to finish 20 strokes ahead of Springfield High and Normal University High, which rounded out the top five.
Hoffman made a little history at OSU’s expense Saturday. His catches and yards both were career highs, and his diving, supine, 46-yard catch of a tipped ball – a la Lynn Swann in the Super Bowl – was BYU’s longest pass play of the season.

Right now, that isn’t an issue for Rutgers’ fifth-year senior. After battling through ankle and knee issues the past two seasons — he missed four starts last year because of a severe ankle injury — Jefferson said he’s healed and season-ready after being held out of spring practice. He won’t participate in tomorrow’s Scarlet-White game, either.

For example, one of Rochoux's signature chocolates — the Habanos Cigare, a combination of Cuban, Dominican and Nicaraguan cigar tobacco — was inspired by a customer who said, "I like to smoke cigars, and I like to eat chocolate. Why not combine the two?" "Why not?" thought Rochoux, who then went on to create the popular bonbon, with actual tobacco that gives it an unexpectedly friendly, sweet-smoky flavor and salty aftertaste.
Friends and colleagues (Chris Blackwell from Island Records among them) remember the political naivete, the assassination attempt, the mania for soccer that injured him and set in motion the disease that killed him. Hints about the sort of "career first" advice he was getting sneak in. We hear, from a daughter and son, what a feckless husband and absentee dad he was.

Last week, after hours of testimony, the proposal passed the State, Veterans & Military Affairs Committee on a 3-2 vote and was sent to the Appropriations Committee.

Consider that Illinois' circuit judges are initially elected on a partisan ticket (Crowder was a Democrat) and thereafter run for retention every six years. If at least 60 percent of the voters approve of her, she stays. If not, tough. If somebody wanted to engineer a scandal, generous and ill-timed contributions could help.
The purple continues in the room most people would have made their dining nook. Hadley decided it was the perfect place for a custom sectional, which she had re-covered in denim fabric to be as soft and durable as a favorite pair of jeans.

For those seniors on Medicaid, here too we are going to place the emphasis on care in the community instead of institutions. This is not only more cost-effective, it will provide more dignity and happiness to our senior citizens – who, in most cases, would, of course, prefer to live in their own homes and in their own communities.

This is not a compliment. What this means is that there are too many spaces that are gratuitously and bewilderingly large, odd curvature in the architecture that creates an abundance of blank space — even beyond the blank space that’s only temporary as the resort slowly rolls out venues over the next couple months — and confusing angles.
attacks by Al Qaeda, Taliban, and other radical groups that we've seen in different parts of the world. The news of the murder of youths was so painful that I turned off the TV. I was bracing myself for another onslaught in the media linking Islam and terrorism. Within hours it was reported that the violence was perpetrated by a blond, blue-eyed Norwegian, Anders Behring Breivik. He is a right wing radical who like other terrorists is misguided in invoking his faith as the basis for his actions. Looking at Breivik's image, I could not fathom that someone with the boyish innocence on his face could commit such heinous crimes, but then faces do not tell us about a person's intentions.
"I treat everyone the same. My family comes in here and I make them wait," said Fish. "I've had to turn my dad away a couple of times."
Now, though, pressure is building to do something about it.

Messages seeking comment were left Friday with Braxton and the diocese's St. Louis attorney.
A tame report on consumer prices helped the market. The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose by a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in January. Excluding food and energy, the index actually slipped 0.1 percent, its first monthly drop in 27 years.
Once they come into focus, you see that both bridges are in both diptychs. The one that highlights the Golden Gate was taken from Point Bonita, as far west as he could get and still see the bridge.

"Autism Every Day" has drawn criticism for presenting an overly negative view. But Thierry says that diluting the financial and emotional strain that raising a child with autism can place on a family would have contradicted her own experience. "I had a mandate," she says. "Tell it like it is."
The state's practice of paying for intensive autism therapy for some children, but not others, has come under legislative scrutiny.
(On the whole, girls drank less -- and less often -- than boys, so while drinking patterns changed equally for both boys and girls, they started at different base lines. Also, only heterosexual couples were included in this study, because too few gay or lesbian couples identified themselves to make a representative sample.)

The noise, so deafening you can barely hear yourself think, is not the only thing that overwhelms at Xfinity. The venue is an attack on all senses. There are logos — for Comcast Sportsnet, Pepsi , NBC Sports, 1-800-Gambler — screaming from every corner; TV screens, big, small, gigantic, flashing everywhere; streams of people lurching from one corner to the next; and from outside, the blare of muscular rock music.
Deaths of animals in fiction are usually devastating, but Swift's account would make even Michael Vick cry. The killing of the dog is done with the same shotgun his father later uses to kill himself. It is a sign of the novelist's imaginative skill that he can show both the shattering effect the killing has on Tom and the reasonableness of the father's point of view: For a cattle farmer, animal sickness and death are inescapable facts of life. Bringing a terminal sickness to a quick end is one of the mercies we can show nature.
8:52 -- SAFETY -- One play and the Giants pass rush is already making an impact. Justin Tuck got to Tom Brady quickly in the end zone, forcing Brady to throw it down the field to avoid a safety. Thing was, there was nobody around the ball that landed around midfield so he was called for intentional grounding and the Giants got that safety anyways. It's not a sack, but it's the type of play that the Giants defense has been making over the last five games. What a start for the defense. The Giants lead, 2-0.

Western culture is besotted by animals and a heightened animal awareness these days. I'm not talking about off-leash dog runs and cute pet tricks here. More and more, it seems, people are aching for some Edenic interspecies paradise, a peaceable kingdom (complete with predators) that operates beyond the borders of subway bombings, greenhouse gas fears and soccer carpools. Humans belong here only as chaste observers -- and preferably, from their point of view, in very small numbers.
Duke may not last until the board meeting. It's hard to see how he survives the scandal and the avalanche of investigations - congressional, criminal, civil, Mexican government and a new one by the company's board - that have started up. The feds have been cracking down hard on similar cases. In February, the former CEO of KBR was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison after pleading guilty to bribing Nigerian officials to obtain natural gas contracts in breach of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act - the same law under which Walmart is being investigated.

Frustrated by a chronic lack of progress, business leaders and politicians expect that a stern dose of this sort of competition and incentives will improve education, but they are wrong. No other nation is taking such harsh lessons from the corporate sector and applying them to their schools. No nation with successful schools ignores everything but basic skills and testing. Schools work best when teachers collaborate to help their students and strive together for common goals, not when they compete for higher scores and bonuses.

Veeck the World War II vet, the amputee, in and out of the Mayo Clinic as if it had a revolving door, is also presented in full detail, including the unfathomable pain he must have been in while delivering to the masses so much laughter and joy. Veeck the civil-rights champion, the one who merits much of the credit that Branch Rickey alone tends to get, the one who marched in the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral procession in 1968, is revealed here as well. This is the man of many parts who held court for us in that Bards Room, a one-legged man who marched to war and marched for peace.

After sitting for more than 25 years, it was completely restored, and based on vintage photos I have acquired, I think it looks better today than ever. After all, a beautiful paint job wasn't a priority for a fledgling independent racing team.

Messrs. Coates and Friedman contend that Baltimore's primary response to its declining population and industrial base since the 1950s has been the redevelopment of its tourist centers and athletic complex centered on the Inner Harbor and that those efforts, while successful in providing outsiders with a positive impression of the city, have not resulted in a broader turnaround. Baltimore's population continues to slip, and its unemployment rate and other economic measures are still bad. Even if the race had generated the full economic impact that organizers promised — or even double or triple that much — we can have little doubt that the researchers' main point would remain. Three-day events, or even 81-day-a-year venues like Oriole Park at Camden Yards, do not by themselves catalyze great and widespread prosperity for a city.

The menu carries the expected classics, but many are updated. The carnitas especial ($17) brings a platter of tiny nuggets of fried pork confit, thick house-made tortillas, a seven-layer fundido takeoff on the seven-layer dip, and guacamole. The accompanying casserole includes two kinds of cheeses and salsa, rice and beans. It produces a welcome, satisfying change from the traditional presentation; the chunks of crisp, moist meat are so good I could eat them like popcorn.
"We were outplayed badly," Hitchcock said. "We didn't compete at a high level. It looked like we wanted the game to be easier.

All conversations with mentors are confidential, which frees teachers to discuss concerns and get support from other newbies.
One of the barriers to even greater success  to reaching out to a younger, hipper audience  has been the longevity of the décor. Brass light fixtures that need to be reshaped into trombones and donated to a marching band, textured white walls that need warmth and color, and mirrors that are a reflection of no reasonable decorating scheme I can think of. The framed art  showcased in a room where I enjoyed such exquisite fresh mozzarella and parmegiano reggiano  is just cheesy.

In the past, when I've given advice on stocking the bar, I've generally set $20 to $25 as the standard for "value," that elusive mix of quality and affordability. But my friend who's closest to college age (at 25) told me that, for her, $20 was "very top shelf" and $15 "still feels like a splurge." I think a lot of people feel that way. And a lot more soon will.

That's what I liked about a new magazine I stumbled upon this week, "The Best of Martha Stewart Living Organizing." It assumes you already know how to get organized and that you should.

Take some milk, add a little acid and give the mixture time to do its thing -- who would have thought homemade cheese could be that simple? What with all the equipment and specialized ingredients I'd read about, cheese making sounded like it was better suited to a chemistry lab than my tiny kitchen. That is, until I tried quark.
Still, TD Garden is where the Boston Celtics play. It is where John Havlicek's No. 17 jersey hangs on most winter and spring nights. If no current Buckeyes players laid eyes on that tribute to his great NBA career, only a few felt the vengeance vibe the players on the great OSU teams of the early 1960s could have sent their way.
Dan Smith: "Union Rags is my pick. He's versatile - he has speed to get a position, all important in a 20-horse field, and he's shown he can recover and still finish after encountering traffic, as he did in the Florida Derby. Also, I love his looks - big, strong, strapping horse. He looks like a Derby winner. He also has a tremendous stride. This is an unusually deep field of 3-year-olds and there are six others that would not surprise me if they won - Dullahan, Bodemeister, I'll Have Another, Gemologist, Creative Cause and Alpha."

During spring breaks, the family often piled into their Chevy Caprice to visit relatives in Mississippi. The children never knew why the family left home at 3 a.m. to start the trips.

Listen, I get it. You want to see a show called “Lucky Duck” as much as you want a root canal. But here’s the deal — it’s actually a lot of fun, and it’s even got a Broadway pedigree. Henry Krieger (“Dreamgirls”) and Bill Russell (“Side Show”) collaborated on the songs for this children’s musical from Kansas City’s acclaimed Coterie Theatre, and playwright Jeffrey Hatcher (“Three Viewings”) co-wrote the book.
"The song obviously resonates with peopleÂ of any age who are becoming bewildered by the amazing rate of change that we are currently experiencing.Â Even younger persons who areÂ betterÂ able to adapt, still need something to rely on - something to 'believe' in," Dalton said. "I think thatÂ most of the people who revere this song are attracted to what they perceive as a message of hope and optimism."

Florida State started last season with outside hopes of that, but injuries helped contribute to a 9-4 mark. Only Florida (7-6) and FIU (8-5) posted winning records last season. After an 11-3 mark in 2010, UCF fell to 5-7 last year. USF posted the same record.
