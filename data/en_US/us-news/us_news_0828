Professors at the U of I sometimes work out of what distance education officials affectionately call the octopus room. The classrooms brain is a motion-sensing camera that follows an instructor around the room. Microphones triangulate the location of a voice so that the camera can focus on the person speaking. Six black arms with video monitors are attached to the brain in the center. This allows students in the class and those taking it online to see and hear each other.

Things get more delicate in mainland Europe. The progress of nuclear is more likely to be halted in Turkey and Italy, owing to the awareness that it was an earthquake that caused the Fukushima disaster. Never mind that both have long-term current-account problems and no domestic resources, Istanbul has averaged one earthquake every 17 years for the past two millennia. That means any nuclear plant built in Turkey can expect to experience at least two quakes in its lifetime.

Yet an irony lurked unnoticed. Humankind's unquenchable, sometimes uncontrollable need to communicate is exactly what gives the festival its distinction. In contrast to the familiar studio fare that fills the nation's multiplexes, many entries at Telluride were, as in previous years, the work of artists with an urgent need to express themselves. One small, lovely film from Singapore made human communication its explicit subject -- Eric Khoo's English-language "Be With Me," two of whose characters, young girls in love, use cellphones as tie-lines to their hearts.
At a recent East Yard barbecue in Commerce's Bristow Park, hand-painted signs read "Salud Sí, Diesel No" -- Health Yes, Diesel No -- as a band played Mexican rancheras and trucks roared by on Interstate 5.

The Beach Boys scored more than two dozen Top 40 singles in the ’60s. You won’t find the likes of “Surfin’ U.S.A.,” “Fun, Fun, Fun” or “California Girls.” Their 1966 landmark album “Pet Sounds” is widely regarded as the group’s crowning achievement.

Now, the act - known to its foes as Obamacare, and to the cognoscenti as ObamaRomneycare - isn't easy to love, since it's very much a compromise, dictated by the perceived political need to change existing coverage and challenge entrenched interests as little as possible. But the perfect is the enemy of the good; for all its imperfections, this reform would do an enormous amount of good. And one indicator of just how good it is comes from the apparent inability of its opponents to make an honest case against it.

Enough is enough. The Santa Clara community has an opportunity to save our schools. A "yes" vote for Measure A means an additional $2.3 million per year for five years to benefit the students of our district.

In retrospect, we should have seen this coming -- and, no doubt, some fans did. Springsteen always seems to shine brightest when we need him the most. His ability to speak to the times -- such as on 1984's politically charged "Born in the U.S.A." and the post-9/11 effort "The Rising" -- is, perhaps more than anything else, why he deserves to be called "the Boss."

"That could have hurt us big time, but we came in here, regrouped, talked about staying patient and just let the game come to us," Lundqvist said. "Coming from that Game 7, such an emotional and big win, it was important for us to regroup and start all over. This team doesn't give up much so we have to be smart with pucks. They kind of wait for mistakes, so the key for us is not to make too many."

Met anyone interesting while hooping? I have met so many people through hooping. This summer, I hooped across the country with my brother. We went on an Cross-country road trip to Portland, Ore., and I can't tell you how many people approached me because of my hooping. Hooping makes you a lot of friends, real fast. It brings people together. When people see a hoop, they instantly want to try it.

Smash made its entrance at 10:00 p.m., earning a 3.8 in adults 18-49 and 11.5 million viewers overall during the hour. It makes it the third-highest rated demo debut for a drama this television season, just two tenths of a point behind leader Once Upon a Time (4.0) and Touch (3.9) -- the latter of which was technically a preview.* Though the series did dip over the course of the broadcast (it lost 20 percent from the first to second half hour), it gave NBC its first demo win in the time slot, Olympics excluded, since Saturday Night Live's election special in 2008.

In January 2008, Oregon's Department of Environmental Quality said the proposed mine wouldn't meet water quality standards because it would divert several small creeks. Later that year, Tracy filed for bankruptcy while still waiting for the Forest Service decision. The service finally issued a thick draft environmental report in February 2009, four years after Tracy filed his second plan. It still gave "no time frame" for approval or denial, Tracy's appeal says.

Thefts of new materials are down across the library - more than 50 percent at several locations - since the library launched the system in September. Last year, just one in five patrons used self-checkouts. Now about 63 percent check out their own books. That frees up staff to manage the library’s high volume of customers and materials transfers.

The ugly  the bloggers are right. The show sadly lacks diversity, not just racially, but financially and culturally too. HBO has yet again managed to make New York seem mostly white and privileged. And yeah, there's no mandate that says every show has to reflect the world we live in. But it would be nice if the one black character wasn't a bum and the one Asian girl wasn't the character who went from intern to employee because of her Photoshop skills. It's tokenism and insulting.

But this is a tenuous argument. In United States v. Vasquez Alvarez (1999), the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals noted that federal law "evinces a clear invitation from Congress for state and local agencies to participate in the process of enforcing federal immigration laws" -- and, indeed, affirmed a "preexisting general authority of state or local police officers to investigate and make arrests for violations of federal law, including immigration laws" (emphasis added).

The study urges the UC regents to restore balance to the faculty and to insist on a full airing of ideas. University leaders should "proclaim that the campus ought to be a rigorous marketplace of ideas, and that this essential idea is betrayed when the campus becomes a sanctuary for a narrow ideological segment of the spectrum of political and social ideas," the study says. "They can insist that the students' need for a well rounded education may no longer be sacrificed to the faculty's drive for the comfort of ideological conformity and uniformity."
The typical hotel-park package includes a room for one night, parking for 7 to 14 nights, and shuttle transfer to/from the airport for departing and arriving flights. Although the sites boast "free" parking, the one-night package rate is almost always higher than the hotel's lowest available rate. But the difference in rates is much less than the cost of parking for a week in an airport-area parking lot: I've usually found the premium for a week of parking is well below $5 a day -- much less than you'd pay at most big airports for just the parking. Many packages provide for parking beyond the nominal limit for an extra daily charge, but those charges seem to be creeping up these days.

UMBC faculty and staff have not had even a cost-of-living increase in three years, and students are facing serious tuition increases. As a faculty member at UMBC, I am aware of several highly respected academics who have moved out of Maryland for other positions, and it is a challenge to the school to offer competitive salaries to new faculty replacements. With this doomsday budget, UMBC (and the other University System of Maryland campuses) would be hard-pressed to retain students and faculty despite all the efforts of Mr. Hrabowski and the UMBC faculty.

Dignity, in Happy Valley, is a past tense word right now. And critics were not wrong when they said Paterno was still trying to call his own shot -- finish out a winning season, then retire.

Have the conversation after both of you have given careful, independent thought to why you both approach this issue the way you do. Then, go into the discussion with this goal and no other: understanding each other. If it's just about proving you're right, then you'll forget to listen.

And, California construction is turning the proverbial corner, creating jobs since last September on an annual basis. By February 2012, it added 6,000 jobs — or 1.1 percent — on a year-over-year basis. That's not much, but is better than nothing. If one has a taste for journalistic hyperbole, it's the best performance in over 6 years.

Kean said that under Governor Christie and Republican leadership in the Senate, local governments have been given more tools than ever to confront the state's crushing property tax burden while maintaining services. "Reforms to pension and benefits for public employees, as well the changes we made to interest arbitration, are yielding savings that will only increase over time," Kean stated.

None of these reforms would have been possible without the input and advocacy of New Jersey's Mayors."

Even though most people think that everyone owns a photo ID, the reality is that millions of Americans do not, and a disproportionate number of these are low-income, racial and ethnic minorities and the elderly.

As part of the deal, the Goldman subsidiary said it will stop the practice of robo-signing mortgage paperwork. Robo-signing came to light last fall when it was revealed that the largest banks had outsourced mortgage paperwork to processing companies that, in turn, hired unqualified people to sign thousands of mortgage affidavits without reviewing loan documents.

One of the lyric books that the Springsteen exhibit had was "Glory Days", and that gave me the chance to check for sure that, yes, Springsteen actually wrote "speed ball." Can you, Mr. Miklasz, explain to me why it's "speed ball"? Can anyone? Why not fastball? Why not heater? Why not, as he sang in a video clip that played as we walked around, "screwball"?

Even before the overly enthusiastic Max bursts onto the scene ("I can paint, too, Arthur!"), it's clear that Art with a capital A is going to come in for some ribbing.

"Art & Max" is one of those rare children's books that lends itself simultaneously to literal and figurative reading.

The CBOE's issues are serious because the SEC has been investigating market access. Regulators want to know if high-frequency trading firms and the exchanges that serve them collude in any way so that their orders are entered and executed ahead of others.

The charge stems from a brawl that broke out March 19 during Davito and Lacher's wedding reception in the backyard of her mother's Gilbert home in the 3200 block of South 147th Place.

Swindle Rig: Swindle Rig once was the name of the Sonoma County town, now known as Forestville, where Duncan Arnot Meyers and Nathan Lee Roberts, of the small artisanal winery Arnot-Roberts, are based. They make just two wines for this offshoot brand, a Sauvignon Blanc from 100% Napa Valley fruit, and a rosé of Grenache. Both are fermented with indigenous yeasts in stainless steel tanks and handled minimally. Meyers and Roberts wanted to make a wine that was "crispy" (read: not overripe) and inexpensive. "We wanted to make an easy drinking and low-ish alcohol wine," Meyers says. They sell Swindle Rig for $20 or less. That's for a liter bottle, which gives you an idea of how the wine is meant to be enjoyed — in generous pours, on late-summer afternoons, with friends.

In the opening strains of the first movement, and again in the lyrical slow movement, she played fluidly and with a wonderful insouciance about tempo. But in faster passagework, that insouciance sometimes shaded into carelessness.
Newton grew up as the daughter of a Rhodesian mother and a British father. She spent her early years in Zambia, but political unrest forced the family to relocated to the town of Cornwall, southwest of London, when she was 11.

In Alex's case, Hirsch was everywhere, at the bus stop, on the bus, and at school, his camera becoming simply another part of the background to Alex and his classmates after a couple of weeks.

San Jose played well for long stretches, especially in the second and third period, but once again struggled to score against St. Louis' stingy defense that allowed the fewest goals ever in an 82-game season.

Last summer was one of the worst in recent history in the prevalence of the parvovirus. Not since the late ‘80s had we experienced so many cases of this normally fatal disease. I had hoped it was a fluke, that we wouldn’t see a repeat this season; unfortunately, it’s not looking good. We’ve already been notified of a litter of pups that succumbed to it and one other case in which the pup actually survived. The fact that those cases started in April is a discouraging sign.

The history of popular Christmas toys is full of noteworthy milestones, some of which are Hall of Fame caliber while others are flash-in-the-pan forgettable, and maybe regrettable for the parents who paid for them.

The blood of this series is on him. It was his second-worst series of his career from a stats point of view, The finals in 2007 were worse. But from a reality point of view it was worse. He averaged 26.8 points, 9.3 rebounds, 7.2 assists. But he shot just 44 percent and he committed 27 turnovers in the six games. In the losses, James averaged 22 points on 37 percent shooting and six turnovers Figure in the points all those turnovers cost the team and it was probably like he averaged closer to 12-15 points a game to the good probably.

They're not talking about much -- mostly a chance encounter Lorraine has had with an ex-boyfriend she's not yet over. But Sharonlee McLean so thoroughly embodies Beverly's sweet-and-sour office-matron persona that things are engrossing from the start. The fastidious way she makes the coffee, the thousand inflections she can use to say "Let me put you into his voicemail," the tiny flicker of a facial expression that shows how bored she is with Lorraine's love life, add up to a character at once familiar and distinctive. It's a wonderful performance. Laura Faye Smith makes a great foil, showing both Lorraine's professional-woman veneer and her bubbling emotional turmoil. What goes on between the words is crucial here, too, and director Rose Riordan (who helped Bock workshop one of his earlier plays, "The Thugs") has worked wonders with the timing and little bits of physical business, such as a howlingly funny moment involving Lorraine and a jar of taffy.
So sure are New Orleans officials of the work being done to turn around schools that they think they can become a model for urban education reform, proof that students of any color, income level or social background can achieve if schools do their job. Indeed, Kingsland -- who came here as an undergraduate at Tulane and entered education reform through a (failed, he admits) stint mentoring impoverished students -- argues that the transformation in this city may turn out to be the most significant national development in education since desegregation.

Bryant scored 31 points, but Karl said that wasn't the reason Denver lost. The big reason Denver lost was the L.A. big men — including 6-foot-10 Jordan Hill, who some fans might not have even known was a member of the Lakers. Hill scored 10 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in 24 minutes of playing time. Gasol, like Bynum a 7-footer, flirted with a triple-double (13 points, eight rebounds and eight assists). And Bynum was Bynum, his 10 blocks tying him with Mark Eaton and Hakeem Olajuwon for the most ever in a playoff game.
Nor are the three characters terribly complex. Black is once again a grubby man-child (in pursuit, of course, of a woman decidedly out of his league). And while it’s good to see Steve Martin doing something besides a dopey remake, there’s no real depth or conflict to his character.
