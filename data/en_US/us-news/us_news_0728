Spinning and shouting her "warrants," Adamine "saw and she saw and she couldn't stop seeing." It's a gift and a curse to "always know what is on the other side of Now, to always hear the future coming on its unstoppable hooves." It isn't her fate to remain in Jamaica.

He is a second-semester senior, weeks away from graduation. His loyalty is very much with Cornell. A potential option exists where he can academically withdraw from this semester, forfeiting tons of hard work and apply to the league to play next year for the Big Red. Or he could graduate, take a job in New York and play for the Long Island Lizards of Major League Lacrosse, who made him their No. 1 overall pick in January. He is leaning on the advice of his family and Cornell coach Ben DeLuca.
It’s too bad. Director D.J. Caruso did one wonderfully strange movie (“The Salton Sea”), one successful one (“Disturbia”) and one stupid one (“Eagle Eye”). He never has done one that was this dull before. Or this needlessly loud.

Beth (Taylor Schilling) is a willowy and gorgeous single mom running a kennel with her speaks-her-mind grandma (Blythe Danner). Logan (Zac Efron) is a brooding but chivalrous ex-soldier who tracks her down after finding a photo of her on a battlefield in Iraq. Director Scott Hicks lifts this material above previous Nicholas Sparks-inspired movies ("Dear John," "The Last Song") by holding his revelations in reserve and producing a scene or two of real sexual heat. But Sparks telegraphs his story's every move and underlines every emotion. Rated PG-13; sexuality, violence. 1 hour, 41 minutes. By Roger Moore.

If there's a hint of citrus, it's grapefruit rind.
Is it manly to cut services that single working mothers need for child care, which enables them to stay off welfare and gives their children a chance to succeed in school? Is it manly to cut services for the disabled, who will become a burden to the economy in other ways while suffering? Is it manly to expect older people to live with fewer medical services?

I live in Shaker Heights, where I recently chaired the Shaker Heights Financial Task Force. We reviewed the financial issues facing our community comprehensively. The impact of an estate tax loss would be widespread, hurting many Ohio communities. Cities and townships have become more efficient. They continue to do so. But estate tax repeal would devastate the quality of many communities and force requests for more local taxes throughout Ohio.
The sad part is this: Amar’e Stoudemire really had a chance to be everything we want our star athletes to be in New York City. He is gregarious. He is funny. From his first moments as a Knick he seemed to understand what it meant to be a franchise player making franchise money.

For example, patients can legally be charged a "facility fee," which hospitals and physicians attach to bills to help pay for the cost of providing a place of care.

The anti-pot law, he wrote, first passed Congress in 1937 after a hearing in which marijuana was said to cause "insanity, criminality and death." Some people, he said, took this literally, and before you knew it, there were marijuana-insanity pleas cropping up everywhere.

Immigrants are integrated into communities across Utah. We must adopt a humane approach to this reality, reflecting our unique culture, history and spirit of inclusion.

About 1.4 million Mexicans left the U.S. between 2005 and 2010, double the number who did so a decade earlier. In the meantime, the number of Mexicans who entered the U.S. sharply fell to about 1.4 million, putting net migration from Mexico at a standstill. More recent data suggest that most of the movement is now heading back to Mexico, accounting for the drop in the illegal immigrant population.

Casspi is averaging 7.1 points, 3.5 rebounds and shooting 40.2 percent from the field — the worst totals of his three-year NBA career.

“The players want to win – that’s the first thing," Tomlinson said. "As players, we always want the guy that is going to give us the best opportunity to win. With Peyton Manning, his track record says it all. He’s won a Super Bowl, been to two, a four-time MVP. His resume tells you right now that this guy is going to be able to come in and we’re going to win. When you’re up against that as players, it’s hard to not say you want a guy like Peyton Manning. He’s one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time."

The city is guaranteed to get paid under this arrangement, but it is also guaranteed to get paid less. Gone is the $250,000 fee the city got for hosting the race under the previous contract. And gone is the promise to reimburse the city for its expenses. Instead, the city would get a $3 fee on every ticket sold. Last year, that would have amounted to $330,000, or less than half of the actual cost. City officials are confident that the head of the new race management group, Dale Dillon, will be able to run the event in a way that uses substantially fewer city resources. That's a somewhat dubious assumption, in that he was running Baltimore Racing Development in the final weeks before last year's race. Even the neighborhoods around the race get less in this deal. They were due for $100,000 a year in impact fees under the previous contract but would get 50 cents per ticket sold under this one. Race attendance would have to nearly double for the neighborhoods to come out even.
"We weren't going to come because last year was so bad," said Peyton, joined by best friend Peggy Tennant and Tennant's children, Zachary, 13, and Caitlyn, 10. Last year, Peyton said, the party was "out of control. There were too many fights."

And it's getting worse. In July, the interest rate on U.S. government-sponsored student loans is scheduled to double to 6.8 percent from 3.4 percent. This will add thousands to the debt owed by today's students, and to the cost of repaying that debt over time. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) has prepared legislation that would extend the 3.4 percent rate, paying for it by ending top end tax breaks - including those on corporate jets.
He said the government in Pyongyang suffered "tremendous humiliation" with the failure of the rocket launch that was meant to celebrate the centennial of the birth of the nation's founder, Kim Il Sung.

There's still a dedication to that notion. Local bartenders use old-fashioned building blocks — house-made drinking vinegars called shrub, reconstituted dried fruit, bitters, preserves, local cider and tinctures, among them — to push the envelope and to put Midwestern winter on the run. There's not a sliver of stone fruit in sight, but it's that very absence that drives creativity behind the bar.

Rucker's bold creativity has been chronicled everywhere from Gourmet to People magazine, and yet it can still be striking in a dish like duck breast with chestnuts and duck crepes -- especially after you've watched it assembled inches from your salivary glands. Rucker has a fondness for internal and peripheral ingredients -- foie gras (which surfaces even in desserts) and pig's feet -- and can make the unexpected seem unmissable. Spaghettini with lamb belly? Why, of course.

Tim Brown, Yahoo! Sports: "So, in the matter of Ryan Braun, a test result that inferred he'd been driven to a playoff game in a vat of testosterone, a collector accused of going rogue, a temporarily sullied Most Valuable Player award, and a Major League Baseball PED juggernaut that is no longer undefeated, one must consider the question: Who are you going to believe, science or those big gorgeous eyes?"

If the dozens of Beck fans rhetorically brandishing their weapons at Piven were all CEOs, bankers, hedge fund operators and so forth -- i.e., the kind of people who have the most to lose from mass protests by the unemployed -- all this might make more sense. But somehow, and I may be naive about these things, it's hard to imagine a multimillionaire suggesting that "folks buy battle carbines with folding or collapseable (sic) stocks and 16(-inch) barrels so they can be more easily hidden under jackets and such. Also, buy in NATO-approved calibers (5.56/.223, 7.62/.308) so you can resupply ammo from the bodies of your enemies too." One of Piven's would-be assassins even admits to being out of work, a condition he or she blames, oddly enough, on Piven herself, adding that "we should blowup (her) office and home."

Winter Park 3, Freedom 0
Typically, these songs have titles that play on the similarity between the words "sax" and "sex," bass synthesizers, noises suggesting erotic abandon, a frantic beat and a loop of a squealing saxophone. Juxtaposition between the breathy analog sound of the saxophone and the synthetic feel of canned beats is part of the point, but most of these producers can’t leave the sax signal alone — they’ll subject it to enough computer tricks to let you know that the woodwind player is dancing to a tune programmed on a mainframe.
Starr said it wasn't until he began insisting on transparent policies, including recording board minutes, that William Schatz's corrupt ways came to light. Schatz, the board's part-time lawyer since 1979, pleaded guilty to taking bribes and diverting checks to his own accounts.

If you're a parent, you know how your baby changed your life in ways you never anticipated. You may have envisioned parenthood one way, only to learn how different reality can be.

But with your commitment, time and energy, it will grow and hopefully make you proud.

But come on, what about the extended version of "Do I Do," from 1982 -- it's on the "Original Musiquarium" collection -- which features Dizzy Gillespie on trumpet? On that one, Wonder, shouts like an excited kid: "Ladies and gentlemen, I have the pleasure to present on my album, Mr. Dizzy Gillespie! BLOW!!!"
This is all true. But if kids aren’t going outside every day with their parents because they spend a lot of time in child care, wouldn’t it make sense to figure out how often they play outdoors there? The study doesn’t attempt this. All they note is that “preschoolers rarely achieve 60 minutes of recommended moderate-to-vigorous physical activity during the child care day.” This is according to a review article published last year in the Journal of the American Dietetic Assn., not the authors’ own measurements.

He states the impressive fact that tax breaks to the wealthy drain $11.6 million from the Treasury every hour. That "impressive" rate represents a little more than $100 billion per year. But Social security and Medicare cannot be stabilized by an addition of only $100 billion per year; the problem is much greater than that.

It says a lot that we ended up with positive feelings about Brio. Mostly, we're glad it's there. Brio might not evolve into a dining destination for Baltimoreans, who know where to find better Italian food. But Brio should have no trouble quickly establishing itself as a favorite send-to for concierges and convention planners. The good-energy atmosphere absolutely makes up for some of the menu's failings. So does seeing a small corner of the Inner Harbor restored to vibrant health.

Meckler ran his projections assuming expenses of $4,000 per month before taxes. Assuming $48,000 a year for living expenses and taxes in the range of $10,000 to $13,000 per year, they are currently in excellent shape, Meckler says. Still, he says there are steps they can take to improve the outlook even more.

A stop at Snack Jack's is a good idea for a jumping-off point to the unspoiled charms of Flagler Beach. Compared with its flashier neighbors in St. Augustine and Daytona Beach, this stretch of shops, houses and unspoiled landscape can easily go unnoticed.

To lift some of that burden, Costello requested and has received permission from state Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner to hire the nine municipal court judges for two months — or until some vacancies are filled — to hear temporary restraining order requests in Superior Court.

In 2003, the Baltimore Symphony donated a concert to the Maryland families. At a reception, many of the families met for the first time. A young mother was so thankful to meet the older wife of a fellow naval officer. She knew that her husband was at the side of the more senior officer, and the two women took comfort that their husbands were together in the end. A college student, in the fragile years between girlhood and womanhood, sat quietly on a bench next to her younger brother. Both were lost in their thoughts, unable to mix. When her father tried to engage her, she looked up, not with the glow of youth, but with dark and tear-filled eyes. It seemed as if, since Sept. 11, she had been weeping without end for her mother.

This is a good destination to shoot for if you want to take a walk north from Pass-a-Grille. It's about 20 minutes from the Hurricane Restaurant. Remember, this is a resort, so pretend to be nonchalant when they announce your bill for a vodka and grapefruit juice: $9.40. Gulp! But it's a large to-go cup and lasts all the way back (but you didn't hear that from us, if you know what we mean). Or you can hang out and look at the pretty people living their dream vacation. Don't be afraid to jump in the pool. After all, you'll earn your way in with all that expensive booze. 3400 Gulf Blvd., St. Pete Beach, (727) 360-1881

The $14.5 million average would make him the third-highest-paid center in the world, after Dwight Howard and Andrew Bynum. Comfortable with that? One GM seems to be. And GMs who work under Jim Dolan’s umbrella never really embrace the notion of delayed gratification, not even when the free-agent class is so awful that it demands conservative spending.
And that’s where you come in. At every pivotal plot point, volunteers are enlisted to roll a large foam, six-sided die to dictate what direction the show takes next, including whether George and Rob will kiss.

And health insurance generally won't pay for yoga classes.

Not that Jell-O salad is necessarily out of the realm of possibilities. One holiday party had a "Remember the '50s'' theme, with the aforementioned salad, seven-layer pseudo Mexican dip, California pot roast (the kind with foil-wrapped meat, canned soup and wine) and more. With it, we watched an early Martha Stewart holiday entertaining tape.

As a Republican in a Democratic-leaning state, Ehrlich at least initially was considered a moderate who didn't always hew to strict party lines.

• Newsday's Al Iannazzone sees a few potential lineup changes if Chandler can't play: "He could play Jared Jeffries at center. Jeffries, who is returning from a knee injury, was running plays with the starting unit in practice...

The Knicks have had success with Anthony at power forward, and Stoudemire is comfortable playing center."
In this world with everyone complaining, I would like to say "thank you" to Mayor Slay and Alderman Joe Vaccaro for helping to put a U-Gas convenience store in the 3200 block of Hampton.

So, they're toast? I've been in Denver for 20 years and have seen the Nuggets get out of the first round twice. On the average, they would get out of the first round 10 times in 100 years. Change is what George Karl wanted. He says how much he enjoys coaching this team. But he prepares his team for the playoffs the same way you would prepare a Pop-Tart. Yes, a Pop-Tart. Pop the Nuggets in the playoffs and any foe pops them right out.

Kreider got into the Rangers lineup only because fellow rookie Carl Hagelin was suspended for three games when he elbowed Ottawa captain Daniel Alfredsson in Game 2.

When searching for a new NFL team, was it any surprise the place Manning looked first was Denver? Helton made Colorado seem like home for a veteran quarterback who cherishes simple comfort more than big-city slickness.

The setting's been updated, but in an inconsistent manner that may or may not be on purpose. The Helmers' place looks as if it's from the late 1960s, complete with wood paneling and lots of vinyl records. But some of the costumes seem contemporary, and at the end Nora's IOU goes through a paper shredder.

Crawford was quietly solid in Games 1 and 2, especially if you discount the bad power-play goals the Hawks allowed. While Smith has received attention for his workload and ability to play pucks outside his crease, Crawford has made several top-notch saves at the other end to prevent the Coyotes from pulling away.
Maybe 30 people can sit in the place at once. But it was jammed with take-out business. Guys in green carpenter's union jackets were in line, and behind them guys wearing Philadelphia prison department patches.

In July 2000, my youngest son, Ryan, was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. He was nine. In a 24-hour period, he went from getting ready for his baseball league playoffs to a 10-hour surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, followed by nine months of radiation and chemotherapy treatments, finishing in April 2001 with a clean MRI. All we could do was hope and pray that future check-ups would yield the same result.

He may be a lesson in the reality that rules don't apply equally to everyone. Especially not to people with money, who can afford to post bail, hire lawyers and navigate the loopholes. Money, by the way, is relative. On the sliding scale of rules, I'm a lot better off than some, a lot worse off than others.
D.J. Abnar (5-8, 170) of Tallahassee Lincoln has the most with offers from Illinois, Iowa State, Middle Tennessee and Southern Miss, but he's listed as an athlete and can play defensive back.

Count me as a big fan of Joe's butchering and Buckhorn's grilling. The steaks we had were perfectly cooked, tender and delicious, with a char that pulls together all of the meat's flavors and showcases what this joint is all about.

While it's unlikely to be even whispered aloud, the financial arrangements the state and county governments have with the fire and ambulance companies are an important part of what will drive the public policy discussion on how Harford County's emergency services will be provided. Certainly, the fire and ambulance companies were founded with an altruistic purpose, one that has been proudly at the forefront, though the large sums of money associated with providing emergency medical service have distorted the picture to some extent.
Hansen, a wealthy hedge-fund manager based in San Francisco, was not at Thursday’s news conference but in an interview with The Seattle Times on Wednesday he said a sense of civic pride and his longtime support of the SuperSonics were at the root of his desire to put together one of the largest privately financed arena packages in pro basketball or hockey. City officials say the $290 million in private investment would be the third-most among NBA or NHL arenas, behind only Staples Center in Los Angeles and Madison Square Garden.
On the big day, the appointed hour came and went. Then another. Finally, after several calls with no response, a battered van showed up. A teenage boy glowered behind the wheel.
