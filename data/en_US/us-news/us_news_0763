This is a form of immersion brewing that I think is a great first step for moving beyond the automatic Mr. Coffee-style of brewing. You can tell the difference in flavor. You let it sit for a while, but I tend to think you can't really ever let it sit too long. On the other hand, the solids still in the cup don't let you shed as much light on the real quality of the coffee, and it can be a real pain to clean up.

She wasn't lying. Just before we went on, our monitors - our way of seeing the parade - went on the fritz. They were fixed nine minutes before we hit the air. Moments later, I would learn a truth about parade commentating: The script is no match for reality. No matter the blood, sweat and tears of parade organizers and on-the-street coordinators, participants show up out of order, or not at all. They overstay their welcome in front of the cameras.

#7 Ditto car rentals. The cutthroat world of car hire isn’t for the timid, but with a little savvy, you can go in swinging like a pro. First off, do some price shopping — use a site like carrentals.com to get a sense of how your desired market is behaving — and then go straight to the company and see if their rates are any lower (sometimes they are). Book a rate you like, then check out Autoslash (autoslash.com), which tracks reservations free of charge and automatically rebooks them at lower rates if they pop up. (Caveat: They don’t service all of the majors yet. For example: Hertz, yes, Avis, no.) If Autoslash can’t support your reservation, make sure you keep checking on your own — it’s not impossible to save $100 or more at the last minute, on the same exact reservation. (Yes, that is a thing that has really happened. Many times, actually.)

The cost in Pakistani lives reaches at least into the hundreds, probably the thousands; their judge, jury and executioner was some CIA kid with a joystick.

In the rare instance that someone does actually say something to you, just say, “Look, I’m sure your family has gone through a lot of emotions with the divorce, I get it. But at the same time (insert your boyfriend’s name here) is really happy and that’s all that should matter.” Then drop it. Always take the higher road and be the bigger person. Always be nice — even to the people who you know hate you. In the end, you’re not doing anything wrong. You’re in such a happy place, so try not to let anyone ruin it.
GM typically tries to keep enough cars at dealerships to last about two months. That 60-day supply ensures that shoppers will have wide selections of colors and options. In January and February, Cruze inventories were at about that level, but by March, supplies fell to about 42 days worth of cars, Zapotechne said.

Over the years, my wife, Susie, and I have collected numerous hanukiot, Hanukkah menorahs, some elaborate and artistic, others beautiful for their simplicity or a special memory they evoke. We have always de-emphasized gift-giving because holidays like Hanukkah and Christmas can easily become celebrations of materialism and consumerism and lose their distinctiveness and meaning. Especially in hard times, it is important to affirm what's truly priceless -- family, friends, faith and freedom -- to appreciate what we have rather than bemoan what we lack, and share our blessings generously with those in need.

We are only just now learning the truly remarkable power of an EF-5 tornado. Several days have passed since Joplin, MO was the victim of such incredible destructive power. The many lost lives and untold billions in property damage have been well documented in local and national news coverage. Less well covered is the power of persuasion the storm conveyed. Religious re-awaking is to be expected, but the most startling was the reformation of Roy Blunt.

Roy Kaufmann, Adams' spokesman, initially said the fact that the mayor is missing calendars "appears to have been an administrative oversight." But after consulting the mayor, he said Adams didn't break any rules because the city code doesn't specify how long the calendars must remain online. That's why, Kaufmann said, Adams' calendars from his term as city commissioner are no longer online.

The yogurt in Greece and Turkey is often made with high-fat sheep's milk and is notably thick and rich. The best approximation in the Bay Area is the strained cow's milk yogurt from Greece marketed here under the brand name Fage, or any thinner whole-milk yogurt drained for at least half an hour (see box, F3). "There are some places in Greece where the yogurt is so thick you can cut it with a knife," says Sortun.

A $50 million, once-secret stealth warship built nearly 30 years ago for the U.S. Navy is now set to be auctioned off for scrap. The Sacramento Bee reports ( bit.ly/JSIVzU) that the auction for the 164-foot Sea Shadow will close Friday. The Sea Shadow was built by Lockheed Martin in 1985 in Redwood City as a way to test radar-cloaking technology at sea. Two years before the military deployed the F-117 Nighthawk, a stealth attack jet, and the Navy was interested to see if the technology could work in the ocean. The lessons learned from the vessel, which from the front looks like letter “A,” are used in modern warship design. Navy spokesman Christopher Johnson said a museum home for Sea Shadow was sought, but no one was interested.

ProPublica's website takes an adversarial tone, highlighting doctors who have been "accused of professional misconduct, were disciplined by state boards or lacked credentials." And it's important that the public know about them. But drug makers also pay doctors who do excellent work to help educate other practitioners about pharmaceutical products. Disclosure of those relationships is healthy, too.

Glazunov's 1904 concerto -- the work of a complicated and compassionate ex-prodigy whose students included Dmitri Shostakovich -- is at bottom a romantic display piece, no more searching than that label suggests. But the score brims with inventive touches. And Kwak makes it sing, finding a current of tenderness in the music that trumps the pyrotechnics. In 20 minutes of nearly nonstop fiddling, she never puts a foot wrong; she is sovereign in Glazunov's dark-hued cadenza and even better in his festive finale, where she plays with marvelous freedom. Her performance is a pointed reminder of what we're losing.

But a recent piece by the Daily on the USDA's purchase of meat that included pink slime for school lunches touched a nerve with a Texas blogger who focuses on kids' food.

The offer came three days after CIT sweetened an offer for bondholders to swap out the company's current debt for debt that matures later and some stock. The proposed restructuring is aimed at reducing CIT's near-term debt burden by $5.7 billion.
What all of these numbers really mean is that a JobsOhio deal must be priced and timed just right or taxpayers will have bartered a steady earner for a speculative investment. Determining what's "just right" won't be easy, however, because the JobsOhio law, while prescribing some forms of what might generously be termed openness, explicitly shields JobsOhio from open-records and open-meetings laws.

The Times report informed us that the U.S. State Departmentdecided to cut the U.S. embassy staff by 50 percent from its current 16,000 personnel. This is a good decision; the U.S. embassy in Baghdad is the largest in the world. The reason given for the decision is primarily to reduce the American footprint in Iraq with the hope of reducing Iraqi hostility toward these evident remnants of occupation.
Both grapes and juice were destined primarily to home winemakers, but some also went to commercial wineries. There, an old theme familiar to Suisun Valley growers is being repeated.

In the title poem of Boss' fine second book, a transported piano veers off track, pitches into a field and rings as if being played. Boss' best poems -- in short, energetic lines where rhymes surprise, echo, reappear -- resonate similarly. He writes beautifully about work, as in "Six Fragments" or "Broke": "broke / bread with our thanks, broke / bank accounts, broke our / backs over banks of taters." Elsewhere, other metaphors -- play as work, sex as food -- fall flat. Overall the poems ring clearly; "pitch," they recall, is a way to fall as well as a way to sing. Grade: B+
the 10 or so counter seats so you can watch chef Ryuji "Mike" Kimura and sous chef Tsukasa Endo prepare the meal. The finished dishes are gorgeous, meant to tempt the eye as well as the tongue.

Dinners feature typical diner fare: hamburgers, open-faced sandwiches, steaks, chicken and gravy, and other home-style dishes. Service can be rushed and could be friendlier.

Both Oliver and Sweeney are new to their posts and ascended through a rough battle that saw longtime Senate President Richard Codey (D-Essex) lose control of the caucus he had led for more than a decade.

Knocking her out could threaten that delicate geographic balance and lead to a leadership crisis in the Senate. Such a maneuver could also play badly because Oliver is an African-American woman in a government that has been dominated by white men.

8. Detroit is home to the largest museum devoted to black history, the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, just west of downtown in the city's cultural district. The museum, in its third location, chronicles the journey from prehistoric Africa to contemporary Detroit. Through early April, visitors can see the exhibit "Soul Sanctuary," which features black-and-white images taken inside black churches by photographer Jason Miccolo Johnson.

Coyotes are most worrisome, and now as dark descends, you can hear neighbors calling, "Here kitty, here kitty," rounding up their furry friends.
At times haunting, at times filled with shimmering lyrical passages and at times maddeningly slow, the first opera by the 38-year-old singer-songwriter showed promise and was greeted with an enthusiastic response. It simultaneously delights and disappoints, a melodic throwback to the era when Puccini and Strauss were composing, with arias and duets and quartets. But the pacing is uneven, coming nearly to a standstill in the first act.
Gentz's attorney in the visitation matter, Donald Aubrey of Mt. Clemens, could not be reached for comment Friday. He earlier noted that Gentz was innocent until proved guilty and has not been charged in the Bashara case.
The stories set themselves up with neat swiftness, proceed at a clip, and shut down with equal speed. They're very skillfully done, "mousetrap stories," as Dave Eggers describes them in his foreword, tales to be taken at a single sitting, with a twist or moral pill that comes so quickly at the end the reader scarcely notices it slipping down. The settings are Indianapolis, where Vonnegut grew up; various locales in New York, including Schenectady; and Cape Cod, Mass., his base of freelance operations. The mise-en-scène, the background aura, falls somewhere between "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Mad Men," an effect as American as Ike and IBM — very much of the 1950s. The endings of some of the stories feel glib or rushed, and that's maybe why they were initially rejected or heaved by Vonnegut into his own reject pile. But vibrating through many of them is the ache, the undercurrent of loss and sadness, that we associate with this most impish yet rueful of American writers.

The following is an excerpt from Sun-Times Theater Critic Hedy Weiss' 1990 review of the Robert Falls-directed revival of "The Iceman Cometh," which starred Brian Dennehy as Hickey.
Instead, those consumers can expect to be phished, says Jay Foley, director of the Identity Theft Resource Center. "They'll get calls from someone pretending to be a fraud investigator," says Foley. They'll ask for the card security codes and expiration dates.

Lucarelli is also the longtime president of State Policemen’s Benevolent Association Local 165, responsible for representing the interests of sheriff’s officers. Jim Ryan, spokesman for the state union, said it was disturbing to see Lucarelli implicated in the alleged bribery scheme, given the union is often asked to address complaints about unfair hiring practices involving sheriff’s investigators. Because investigators are not in the civil service system, sheriffs can handpick who they hire and advance through the ranks.

Ramsey County Commissioner Tony Bennett, the Vikings' key stadium ally, said that Wilf isn't looking to build a "major" convention center that would compete with those in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Instead, there might be a "medium-sized convention center/hotel" at the stadium site, Bennett said.

Storing herbs. The new Prepara Herb Savor ($14.95) came highly recommended to us by a Sur La Table manager. But truth be told, we were dubious. Why would a little plastic gizmo that you fill with water preserve your basil and rosemary any better than the old-fashioned method of wrapping them in a wet paper towel?
"Public benefit," properly understood, should mean projects that benefit the whole public: police stations, hospitals, schools, and libraries. Not auto malls or upscale hotels.

The pro football world is struggling to make sense of Junior Seau's apparent suicide. Here was some of the early media response:
Notes: Point guard Andre Miller had seven assists, passing Kevin Johnson for 17th place on the NBA's all-time list with 6,712. ... The Blazers eight-game home win streak is the third-longest active streak in the NBA. ... Camby's eight assists were his most with the Blazers. ... Aldridge's 14 third-quarter points matched the total of points the Rockets scored in the quarter, when the Blazers outscored them 25-14. ... Kevin Martin led the Rockets with 15 points, but made only 6 of 17 field goals.

Ian Frazier calls it his midlife crisis — in 1993, in his early 40s, he makes his first trip to Russia and falls in love with the entire country, but especially with Siberia. He is in awe of Russia, particularly Siberia: Its very name in Russian, he writes, "Siber — is pure onomatopoeia. A shiver begins with the first letter and concludes with the paralyzed r at the end." Frazier carries this tone of childlike wonder and delight throughout this book of his travels, thoughts and research into the history of this region that contains 39 million people and covers one-twelfth of all the land on Earth (the U.S. and Europe could fit inside it, he writes proudly in the early pages).
Howell introduces us to information we never knew was obtainable during the early years of pelagic birding. The 520-page tome includes 975 photographs -- most shot by Howell himself -- and 66 maps.
Bobbi Jo Craft, a 16-year veteran of the sheriffs office, is charged with one count of embezzlement of $1,000-$20,000 by an agent or trustee, a felony punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment.

Taxation may be the clearest portal through which to view these two good pubic servants. Knopp sees profligacy; Telfer sees inefficiency. Telfer would comb the budget to make sure every dime the government gets is used well. Knopp would prefer fewer dimes.
BNSF agent David Anderson said in a deposition that his boss asked him not to visit the scene that night. When asked if it's important to reach accident scenes quickly to preserve evidence, Anderson said, "Yes," according to a transcript of the interview.
Nobody ever was charged in Etan’s disappearance, though Etan’s father, Stanley Patz, and an investigator assigned to the case became convinced that a convicted pedophile named Jose Antonio Ramos was to blame. In 2004, a civil court ruled that Ramos was responsible for Etan’s death – the boy was declared legally dead in 2001 – but Ramos denied involvement. He is serving time in a Pennsylvania prison on an unrelated child molestation charge and is due for release this year.

Just last week manager Manny Acta said the number of strikeouts was unacceptable. They went into the weekend leading the AL with 985 strikeouts. So the stat geeks behind the whirring computers in the executive offices at Progressive Field better find a new template to follow.
Also last week, Holder issued a sternly worded rebuke to allegations that he was misleading Congress. After Republican Rep.

The following week, she called me to say that she was extremely hurt that I did not invite her to this party. I was taken aback. I told her this was a neighborhood thing. (She lives 50 miles away.)
Q: After seeing Sunday's loss, why should anyone believe Miami is any tougher mentally than it was last year? They failed to close out the 76ers last year in the first round and now have done the same with New York. Was it not this same passiveness that cost them a 15-point lead in Game 2 of the Finals? -- Lou.

My editors dispatched me to check in on an organizing meeting of what would on Monday become Occupy Oakland. I pictured a group of middle-aged adults and couples with children from all parts of the city -- the so-called 99 percent. Instead, I found myself sitting in an amphitheater sunk into a corner of Mosswood Park with 100 or more people I recognized from just about every protest I had covered in the past two years since the first Oscar Grant march in 2009.

Rahima Yusufi, a lawyer with the local government department for women's affairs, said her office had 10 cases of this kind in the last six months. "In order to educate men and address the problem, the gender section of the women's affairs department has organized three or four seminars for mullahs and imams, whose views enjoy great respect, because they can inform people about behavior that goes against religious principles."
Reasons for optimism: Paulson is an NFL prospect who could become the Ducks' top receiving target this season. Last year he caught 24 passes for 418 yards and four touchdowns. The top statistical performer returning on the outside is Tuinei, who caught 36 passes for 396 yards. The 6-foot-5 Tuinei is a not a burner but is a matchup nightmare for most defensive backs because of his size. He's also a reliable blocker. Providing speed on the outside will be Huff, who should get a heavy dose of quick screens and down field routes. He caught 19 passes for 303 yards and three touchdowns last year. Hoffman won't frighten defenses deep but he had a strong spring and should be a reliable underneath receiver for quarterback Darron Thomas. Expect to see running back Kenjon Barner on the field in the slot position. Oregon hopes to increase his touches and have him on the field more often with running back LaMichael James.
With a new roof, exterior and freshly painted purple doors, the two-bedroom, one-bathroom dwelling was once in severe disrepair after being foreclosed on. Property records show it was purchased last year for $160,000 by Restore Neighborhoods LA Inc., a nonprofit created by the city’s housing agency to use federal funds for purchasing, rehabilitating, marketing and selling foreclosed homes in hard-hit areas.
A comment posted about the findings went so far as to say: “The way this is being reported in the media is quite disgusting that drinking is bad for you, when the empirical evidence is the complete opposite.”

It's already cold. It will be colder, much colder at, say, about 11 p.m. tonight, late in the fourth quarter, especially if the wind starts blowing off Lake Washington.
We adopted a puppy last year, and ever since we brought him home, he has been nipping and biting. We met with a woman who trains dogs, and she said it could be an issue. She advised us to pinch his lips against his teeth as soon as he nips to show that it hurts. It doesn't faze him at all. He jumps up on us, lunges at us and bites. He is a good dog otherwise.
On the night they were released from jail, Joey, Matt and Corey walked from The Block to a nearby Motel 6. Joey shelled out $43.99 for the room.
"The fly in the ointment is that while BRAC has been a great boon for the state and for Howard County, the next challenge for the county and the state is to provide the improved transportation infrastructure," Segall said. "…It is going to have to be dramatically improved, or you're going to have major gridlock that will essentially choke off further economic growth."
“After I went out with the coach, I talked to the players to see how they liked it,” Jones said. “What they told me kind of clinched it for me. They told me real good things about the coaches.

At his first news conference as Stanford head coach, he said he hadn't planned on becoming a football coach after college. He said he was headed for the financial world until he was offered an aide's job by Western Washington.
Century and Sprague both lost in the first round of last season’s playoffs.
Last month, Apotheker said that business would go up for sale in a badly blundered announcement that hastened his demise. His disclosure likely devalued the business in the eyes of potential buyers. Many analysts now speculate that HP has no choice but to keep the business and work on repairing strained relationships with customers. Whitman says a decision, on whether to keep it or possibly spin it off, should come by the end of the year.

Italy alone has euro1.9 trillion ($2.5 trillion) in debt outstanding, and has euro300 billion in debt to roll over next year. To put that into perspective, Europe's temporary bailout fund is equipped with euro440 billion, part of which is already committed to Greece, Ireland and Portugal. European countries have agreed to loan euro200 billion to the International Monetary Fund to bolster its ability to help save the euro. Still, more financial firepower is needed to calm bond investors, analysts say.
Rivera plans to remain with the team through the weekend.
One of the final issues — if not THE final issue — was the players' wish to add an opt-out clause. They knew that the old collective bargaining agreement, which originally was supposed to run from 2006-12, expired this March because the owners exercised an opt-out clause in 2008. Eventually, though, the players were willing to drop that demand.
The guide, however, is strict and will insist on describing each piece in the five-room exhibit. At tour's end, visitors unwind and check e-mail at the Hermitage Internet Café, enjoying traditional desserts such as yogurt-and-jam cake, bulkhi with chocolate (like croissants, but with thicker, sweeter bread), tea and coffee. Russian bartenders never settle for coffee, demanding what kind: espresso, Americano or cappuccino. It's my advice to get the espresso, because you can make it into the two latte drinks by adding milk.
In the past few years, Indy has become this eclectic vibrant burg. Sure, we're made fun of and kicked to the curb by much bigger cities with ocean views. And yes, some think we're a test market for bad fashion. Who cares? We make it up in the friendly department.
The government contends that the payments constituted campaign contributions in violation of federal limits on donations. The obvious hitch in this charge is that the money didn't go to the Edwards campaign and wasn't used by the Edwards campaign. Paying off your mistress is not a campaign expense, not even in 21st-century America, not even in Louisiana, not even in the John Edwards campaign.
