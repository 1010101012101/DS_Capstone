A good starting place when buying wine as a gift is to figure out what you know about the recipient, says Natalie MacLean, editor of the widely read wine website, NatalieMaclean.com. Even if that's only whether they like a full-bodied wine, a light red or a particular region, a little know-how can help to personalize the gift. (And, of course, you do need to know if they like wine. Splurge on a pricey cab for a teetotaler and you'll miss the boat completely.)

øIt's rare to find such a wholesome, clean and high quality app in the "free" part of the apps marketplace. "Awesome Eats" is a wacky sorting game that makes playing with vegetables fun. But it also teaches kids about healthy eating by introducing them to over 50 vegetables and grains, and delivering cute nuggets of information (such as flavoring drinks by adding frozen fruits) in between the puzzles. Produced by the Whole Kids Foundation (a non-profit associated with the Whole Foods Markets), the game delivers on the mission of engaging "children in making good food choices." Veggies and grains appear on multiple conveyor belts. As they zip by, kids use their fingers to grab hold of the foods so that they can transfer them onto the belt that will drop them into the correct boxes. These belts go in different directions, and some pause and change directions. Plus there are birds flying by trying to steal your food. All of the veggies have be anthropomorphized making them more fun to play with. With 32 levels, which get progressively faster and wilder to control, kids will have to stay on top of their game to sort the "Awesome Eats."

It does use external code modules that aren't part of Prey's core library, but the modules themselves are used by just about everyone, so their behavior and limitations are well understood by the security community. If Prey itself was designed to prey upon its users, that would have been discovered long before now; from that perspective, it's safe.

"Those for whom fear has an attraction; those who are interested in the mysterious life people live in their dreams during sleep; those who believe the dead are not really dead; those who are afraid of the fog and of their own hearts . . . they will perhaps enjoy going back to the early days of this century and entering into the strange house of mist that a young woman, very much like all other women, built for herself at the southern end of South America." So begins this hypnotic and otherworldly novel, written in English by Bombal, who was reworking texts that had been published earlier in Spanish.

"Wuthering Heights" and "Jane Eyre" are both recalled, although the style isn't gothic, but mesmerizingly clear. The jacket of this new edition reworks George Salter's original cover art from 1948 -- appropriately haunting and dream-like.

I think it is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times, we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of Congress. I personally do not agree that American citizens should pay for these social activities. What happened to personal responsibility and accountability? Where do we draw the line?

Against that backdrop, the temporally challenged have become more scientifically relevant than ever. Neuroscientists have come to recognize that patients with devastating brain disorders such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases greatly underestimate the passage of time. Poor timing is a hallmark in several psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, autism and attention deficit disorder. Many of about 5,500 soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with traumatic brain injury will find that faulty timing is one of the invisible wounds that follow them into civilian life. And researchers have confirmed that as we reach senior status, our internal clock grows increasingly unreliable.

The cases show how millions of advertising and marketing dollars can be rendered powerless when a company's product is swept into a big news story. Hostess Brands Inc., which owns Twinkies, says it does not have any archival information on how it handled the popularization of the term "the Twinkie defense."

You have to see the '50s-era musical Life Could Be A Dream at the Laguna Playhouse! The star-crossed love story of a sexy auto mechanic and his boss' daughter is fabulous, but what really makes it work is the music. The intricate doo-wop four-part harmonies sung by Skip, the mechanic, and his new-found singing buddies Denny, Eugene and Wally make the show a delight. With the story line revolving around the guys preparing for an audition for a local radio show contest and the seemingly impossible love story, classic nostalgic songs were performed like "Sh-Boom" (Life Could Be A Dream), "Tears on My Pillow," "Earth Angel," "Stay" (Just a Little Bit Longer), "Runaround Sue," "Fools Fall in Love," Lonely Teardrops," "Duke of Earl," "Pretty Little Angel Eyes" – I could go on and on. It was a '50s love fest! Together with the sharp choreography and talented cast – Jessica Keenan Wynn was Lois, Doug Carpenter was Skip, Ryan Castellino was Wally, Jim Holdridge was Eugene, and Daniel Tatar was Denny – the sold-out audience of 420 ate it up!

(3:35) Miller Jump Shot: Missed
* I'm a little surprised in the Cleveland Browns' interest in Rams offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur as a head-coaching candidate to replace Eric Mangini. A little surprised, but not stunned. After all, Shurmur did improve the Rams' points/yards production in 2010. He also did a nice job in acclimating Bradford to the NFL. As I've written and discussed many times before Shurmur's small-ball approach, though irritating at times, was the way the Rams had to do given the limitations at receiver and the inexperience at QB and at offensive tackle. Playing small ball cut down on interceptions and sacks and got Bradford grounded. We can complain -- and I have -- about the play calling in certain games or series, but overall the small-ball offense fit the Rams' personnel. Can Shurmur take Bradford to the next level? That remains to be seen.

Bodhi Ganguli, an economist who covers Ohio for Moody's Analytics, already sees manufacturing cooling off in the Cleveland and Akron areas.

So Im not a big jinx guy. As a result, I find the Johnson/Madden news to be one of the neatest things to happen to the Lions franchise in a long time. Three years ago, this team made headlines for being the worst team in the long history of the NFL. Now their best player is also the most popular player in the game  at least in terms of fan voting for the Madden cover. The Lions are cool again. And theyre cool thanks largely to Johnson and the guy getting him the ball  Matthew Stafford.

So its in both sides' interest to keep the fans fired up about the draft. The same fans that made the draft's popularity what it is today.
