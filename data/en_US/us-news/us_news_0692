The Public Employees Retirement System does need reform, including the reforms recommended in Gov. Ted Kulongoski's 2010 Reset Cabinet report. That report noted that, if it wasn't reformed, PERS could add more than $1 billion to the general fund costs for state and school employees.

Like Elvis, James Brown started out dirt poor. His father worked in camps harvesting turpentine from pine trees. His parents split up when he was 4, and Joe Brown raised his son in deeply segregated Augusta, Ga. Brown liked to tell people that he was a stillborn child -- that he was literally born dead, and had to fight to enter the world.

Reliance filed a "termination of registration" notice Friday, saying that it has 725 shareholders. A provision of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, which President Barack Obama signed April 5, lets bank holding companies avoid SEC disclosure requirements if they have fewer than 1,200 shareholders. Previously, the disclosure rules applied to all companies with more than 300 shareholders.

I credit Strantz for understanding the dynamic character of the region and not trying to turn it into something else. He was an Ohio native who studied art in college while majoring in turf-grass management. He learned to operate heavy machinery and, even after making his name, loved getting dirty with his work crews.

Luck is considered the most NFL-ready quarterback since Peyton Manning left Tennessee in 1998 for the Colts. Oddly, he will wind up as Manning's replacement in Indy after the four-time MVP was released by the Colts and signed with Denver. Rarely do college quarterbacks call their own plays or have total freedom behind center. Luck did.
"There's only so much that you can see out here when we're not going live, but they're learning how to practice," Schwartz said.

BLT has an Asian calamari salad (the only thing Asian about it is the unseasoned, soggy tempura batter on the squid), Italian pork and veal meatballs (fairly moist, but nothing to write home to Nona about) and a French Dip, (which is American, not French). BLT even inexplicably serves up a full complement of Japanese maki rolls. Whatever the explanation for this anomaly, the coconut-macadamia shrimp roll's buttery nuts, spicy cilantro and sweet shrimp harmonize well.
Mountain View security software company Symantec also dropped substantially Tuesday, after decreasing its expectations for the current quarter and forecast a double-digit decline in revenue next quarter. The stock fell 11.4 percent to close at $16.01.
AT&T, the second biggest U.S. mobile service, said in January that it would tighten its upgrade policies this year to help reduce handset upgrade costs.

Professor Virgil Adams was her teacher and mentor. I met Adams a couple of weeks ago at an evening vigil for Za'Zell held by about 40 students near the campus pond. "She knew all about domestic violence," Adams told the gathering. "But you have to understand: it's hard to say when to leave." The vigil is one of three events the campus Human Services Club and Club LEAD (Ladies Empowered And Determined) planned for this semester as a tribute to Za'Zell. The one that in my mind can make the biggest difference is scheduled for next week.

I wish Byron Scott would take him out of the game immediately following a play in which he tries to create his own offense with at least 10 seconds on the shot clock. If he does that a couple of times, Thompson will start to pass the ball so he can stay on the court."
The Bears usually deliver death blows on special teams. It's one of the things they do best. In fact, the reason the Bears are a viable Super Bowl contender is because they're capable of winning in all three areas. The offense played very well before this game, particularly when it enjoyed plus field position. But Cutler made a couple of bad throws, and there were serious issues trying to get their receivers open against the excellent cornerback tandem of Charles Woodson and Tramon Williams.
So here's the deal: If you want more households in which one parent can stay home with the kids, you need to boost the incomes of average American families -- and especially of poorer families. For millions of American moms and dads, debates about "feminism" or "social conservatism" are irrelevant. It's about money.

What will occur appears murkier. Spring in the Pacific is often a volatile, evolving period, and computer forecast models don't have a high batting average for nailing conditions seasons ahead. Halpert said forecasters currently give slightly better-than-normal odds of neutral conditions occurring in the Pacific, and a marginally better chance of a shift to El Nino. He expects to have clearer picture of what late 2012 holds by early summer.

Trumka would not say how much money the national AFL-CIO office would contribute to the law's repeal. But the labor leaders at Thursday's roundtable made it clear they expect the law's supporters to spend a lot of money to uphold SB 5, which reduces the collective bargaining power of about 360,000 public workers in Ohio. The law also would increase health care costs for some workers and put an emphasis on job performance as opposed to seniority.

Jacobs' criteria for the system required that each penetration have a label that could be read by a barcode scanner with a PDA that could display who the installer was, when it was installed, what system was used, and any other pertinent information for that particular installation. She also wanted the system to track that location back to a building plan that could pinpoint exactly where the penetration was. In addition, she wanted photo documentation of the installation that then linked back to the previous records without having to manually enter all the data and link pictures with database files, etc. "I wanted a completely electronic system so that all of the information talked together without a full-time person manually connecting the dots and putting all of the data together to document one penetration or one barrier," she said.
And so we have “The Beaver,” in which Mel Gibson has become such an emotional basket case that he can only to speak to his family through a puppet. Or “Beginners,” with remote Christopher Plummer having to come out of the closet — at age 75 — before he can even begin to relate to his son. Or the recent “Due Date,” in which father-to-be Robert Downey Jr. handles a small annoying boy by punching him in the stomach.
All of the "360" concerts feature a stunning feat of engineering: the four-taloned "Claw" stage. The 390-ton, green cabana stands more than 10 stories above the band as they strut through the crowds on moving bridges and a ring-shaped stage with concertgoers inside and out.

Most of the critics have cited as reasons for their impatience the show's record-breaking preview period and the high cost of tickets, which for a single seat can approach $300. They also worry that producers are deliberately outflanking them by pushing off potential negative write-ups, even as the show enjoys a virtually sold-out run: So far, the musical's 67 preview performances translate into close to 130,000 tickets sold.

Other issues have emerged with the San Bruno line and other older PG&E pipes. The federal safety board concluded that the Sept. 9 blast happened at a weld that was only half as thick as the inferior pipe itself. And California regulators have questioned the company's practice of periodically boosting pressure on older lines to the legal maximum, a strategy that experts said could have weakened San Bruno and other lines.
I have no benchmarks by which to measure Green Boheme, only a sense that it does what it proposes to do and does it admirably. With Preston's determination, it will continue to get better.

I can only hope that Florida follows in Kansas' footsteps and slams the door on late-term abortions. As you know, Kansas became the second state to ban abortions after an unborn child is viable — except in cases where the mother's life is threatened — with its Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The measure correctly contends that "by 20 weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human."
At last count, redevelopment agencies were getting 12 percent of the property taxes paid in the state – more than $5 billion a year. This meant billions less was going to education than otherwise would have been – and the state's costs to “backfill” K-14 districts for the property taxes lost to redevelopment exceeded $2 billion annually, the Legislative Analyst's Office said. Critics argued that cities misused the money for projects favoring developers, or failed to deliver, or hoarded millions in reserve accounts (or all of the above).
"People expected it could go down, but we expected it might be between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. So this was a little earlier than we expected," Crain said.

Unfortunately, service leaves me yearning for a bit of the aloha spirit. I'm not expecting anybody to throw a lei around my neck, but greetings are excessively casual ("Hey") and not particularly warm, while goodbyes are non-existent. After one meal, the waitress simply tosses the check on the table while waving and running over to a customer she's recognized.
A: When I went on a job interview one day with Aleene Jackson, who at the time had the No. 1 television show on the Nashville Network called "Aleene's Creative Living," and I ended up working as a producer for the show. It was my first job in the industry, and one day someone didn't show up for a segment and I went on-air and learned how to use the Indian bead loom and got exposed to the industry. This was in around '02.

Beat the clock: Your lung performance peaks between 4 and 5 p.m., which makes it the best time to do aerobic exercises. But if the only chance you can get to the gym is at noon, you should still go, Medarov said.
The Lions have done nothing wrong. They drafted players who smoke marijuana. Yes, its illegal. Yes, it may constitute a violation of the leagues drug policy. Yes, suspensions may come. And yes, Leshoure, Fairley and Culbreath are most likely part of a large number of professional athletes who smoke marijuana. The other ones just happen to be smart enough not to get caught doing it. Im not excusing the behavior. But Im also not so bull-headed to think that this is a Lions-only problem and they need to rid themselves of the pot smokers.

A. Dear Tina, Not only is your neighbor heartless, but he AND the tree-trimming company have probably violated the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Birds and active nests are protected from any kind of harassment or harm. Honorable landscapers will almost NEVER trim trees in the spring and early summer unless they can ensure there are no nests; but guaranteeing this is tricky. Hawks, owls, and other large birds have nests that are easy to spot. Little songbirds, on the other hand, have tiny nests that are usually well-hidden to keep them safe from predators. This being the case, most law-abiding tree trimmers will recommend waiting until the fall to complete a tree-trim, when the babies have all flown away.

Is all of this enough to freshen a well-known story? Not always. Sometimes the over-familiarity and the play's traditional proscenium staging make the action feel slow.

Hey, Phil: I said from the start I was "uneasy" with the trade and it indeed would look better next year. I will say that sometimes it's better to take one superstar than have four positions filled with average players. Now, if Taylor and Little perform as better-than-average players, the trade obviously tilts further in the Browns' favor. On the other hand, Atlanta could afford to make the trade because the Falcons feel they're one dynamic offensive player from competing for the Super Bowl. Right now, the Browns clearly hold the advantage in this trade. Let the games begin.

Recognizing this challenge, a growing group of business leaders, scientists and economists has settled on a target for increased federal energy R&D: $15 billion, compared to the current level of about $3 billion. The consensus extends from a coalition of business titans including Bill Gates and GE Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Immelt, to dozens of Nobel Prize-winning scientists, to the president's chief technology advisers. This investment, they argue, can drive down the price of low-carbon energy, help regain U.S. clean-tech leadership and spur the development of entirely new industries.

The EPA is applying the policy in West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia and Tennessee. "All the science here and all the data, much of it comes from the state of West Virginia," Jackson said.
However, the court said, because "the passage of time has made it impossible" for Lyon to run against the Democratic nominee, he can not "mandatorily" be installed as freeholder. As a result, the court ordered the county to elect an interim to replace Nordstrom, then hold a special election in November.
He deserves it. Russell is the company that Davis, the most dominant NCAA Tournament player in a generation, is keeping. He needs one more big game, in Monday's final against Kansas, to validate that opinion.
John Carlson had given the Capitals a 2-1 lead in the third period.
It is ironic that luxury products are so prevalent in the world today and yet at the same time, real luxury and real craftsmanship seems to be going down. Everybody knows Edward Green shoes or Hermes ties or Drakes scarves and they're all very well-made products. But there used to be dozens and dozens of good tailors in New York and now there are maybe half a dozen, and maybe only two or three custom shoemakers in the whole country. Everyone thinks about luxury but real craftsmen are dying off.

There are neighborhood places, and then places that make you want to live in the neighborhood. When you have one of the best chefs in town at the helm, it's hard not to have a good meal. Especially when it's a chef like Karen Small, who is as devoted to artful preparations of fresh and local ingredients as she is operating a place that resonates "good times." In a word, dining at Flying Fig can be exhilarating. (Also, loud.)

Dude. Howard Stern's audience needed to hear that. I realize one plug from Howard won't change anyone's mind, but it will probably make a dent in the macho armor. And these little dents, these cracks that let the light in, are why it no longer matters whether "Brokeback Mountain" scores the big awards. It's already made its impact. It's made us laugh and cry and become part of our lexicon. "I wish I knew how to quit you" and "It's nobody's business but ours" are right up there with "Hasta la vista, baby" and "Go ahead, make my day" in the cultural patois.

"Does that make any sense at all?" Evans asked.
No, he does not.
What has happened is America is different. I'm at a different place because the country is at a different place. And I think that in the context of the country changing, what was considered extreme 30 years ago is more central now, and what was central is considered more to the far right now. And I think that once America is different, those they saw as saying something that was radical, they say, well, that's not really that crazy. I'm not really saying anything different than I said 30 years ago, that America ought to work for everybody, it ought to be fair, it ought to be equal. Let me give you an example: If I say today that I support same-sex marriage, well, imagine saying that 30 years ago. So a lot of things that appear more acceptable today were unthinkable 30 years ago.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, on a recent night as she learned to use a chain saw to slice into roofs, she made jokes about being drenched in sweat wearing full regalia, including an oxygen tank, in the spring heat.

"He could be my grandson," quipped the 61-year-old Watson, who needed seven more strokes than his namesake to get around the course. "I just had to smile inside watching him play. I didn't play particularly well myself, but I certainly was impressed by the way he played."

On the trail, enjoy lovely views of the Bay and Golden Gate bridges. You can see Brooks Island, the hills of Point Richmond, Point Isabel and Albany Hill. Paths lead off to the left, but stay on the fire road until you come to the third path (marked by a small, white-capped pipe spattered with red paint sticking up from the ground). Turn left here and you are on what once was a Boy Scout nature trail, complete with marking posts. Past the first marker are two benches, one inscribed with the name of the troop that built it.
Overall, the tweaks drew enough "yes" votes from General Assembly Democrats to declare the redistricting plan an emergency measure, letting it take immediate effect.

Feature writing: Eli Sanders of The Stranger, a Seattle weekly, for his haunting story of a woman who survived a brutal attack that took the life of her partner, using the woman's brave courtroom testimony and the details of the crime to construct a moving narrative. Finalists: John Branch of The New York Times for his deeply reported story of Derek Boogaard, a professional hockey player valued for his brawling, whose tragic story shed light on a popular sport's disturbing embrace of potentially brain-damaging violence, and Corinne Reilly of The Virginian-Pilot, Norfolk, for her inspiring stories that bring the reader side-by-side with the medical professionals seeking to save the lives of gravely injured American soldiers at a combat hospital in Afghanistan.
Amid the darker themes, there are moments of real joy on "Blessed." "Sweet Love" points to the satisfaction of marriage and a settled domestic life. Hearing her softly whisper, "Everything in me and of me is yours forever," some fans may wonder if Williams, known for using her own rough experiences as building blocks for her work, was forever closing the door on years of sass and the paeans to drunken angels. Not to fear: Williams isn't much on being a tortured artist and doesn't need to be heartbroken to write a heartbreak song. "As a songwriter, the more experience you've had with anything helps, but you don't need to be in the experience in order to write about it," she says. "It's equally important to have an imaginative perspective and understand language."
A naturalist explained some of the dynamics of sea lion bulls and the struggle to maintain both weight and a harem - no time to eat when there's females to keep.

"Our guys believed all year that we could compete and beat anybody that we played," Ohio coach John Groce said after the near miss.
Alex Prager's recent work at M+B has the proper look to be taken seriously these days. The photographs, in vivid color, are large, self-consciously contrived and assertively cinematic. They are displayed in groupings, mostly pairs. In each set, one big picture depicts a staged accident or disaster of some sort -- a burning or flooded house, a woman caught in power lines, a man hurt in a car crash. The smaller image, hung alongside, tightly frames a single eye, usually a woman's, elegantly made-up, theatrically lighted and generally impassive.

If you think about it, this episode has all the elements of a classic call story. There is an unlikely hero, and multiple obstacles to be overcome, and a persistent summons that cannot be ignored no matter how many barriers appear to be in the way of answering it.

For the German people, unconditional surrender in spring 1945 meant the end of self-government for the foreseeable future. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower minced no words when he announced that the Allied troops were there as conquerors, not liberators. Of course, they were, in fact, both. But, as Frederick Taylor says at the outset of his enthralling book, "Exorcising Hitler: The Occupation and Denazification of Germany," the country, "as it came under Allied control, resembled a blank object, a clean sheet." As far as government, yes, but the Nazis had fouled that sheet, and "Exorcising Hitler" shows just how much messier — politically, socially and economically — things became before they could be cleaned up sufficiently for a new kind of society to take root.

-- Joel Przybilla in the game for Portland now ... nice to see him out on the court. Both teams are having trouble finishing at the end of this quarter. Even though it hasn't resulted in hoops, you have to like the way Rudy Fernandez is moving with the ball and tipping around loose balls. As the final seconds wind down in the first, Patty Mills is blocked hard at the hoop and the Knicks can't make anything out of the fast break at the other end. At the end of the first quarter, New York leads Portland, 29-23.

Surely, Bryant could've offered more than 18 points on seven-of-12 shooting. But I don't fault Bryant's initial approach. I do fault, however, Andrew Bynum and Pau Gasol, who lacked much aggressivness to really have a significant impact the game. Bynum (17 points, five-of-nine shooting) and Gasol (11 points, four-of-10 shooting) might have seen strong double teams, but Bynum looked tentative on the boards (two) while both Bynum and Gasol looked tentative filling the lane on defense.

Our leaders look back to the 1970s for cheap gas as disincentives for innovation and risky technologies that have put off the inevitable exhaustion of non-renewable energy at the cost of spoiling our deep sea food supplies and fracking that the earth below our communities ("Road to energy independence goes through ANWR, Keystone," March 11).

I know if I could go back to high school right now, I would do theater. Back then, though, I was afraid my friends would make fun of me. If I actually had decided to become an actor by trade, I would have been more proud of what I wanted to do and would have had more fun experiences and more time learning about the craft of acting. The thing is you’re just so carefree back then. You sure don’t appreciate it when it’s going on.”

A. It's funny - I was cast before "Twilight," actually. "Twilight" is this huge phenomenon, but I've yet to get a job from it! (laughs) I was cast in "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" (her next film) for ages before "Twilight" came out. And Jason saw "Rocket Science" and didn't even know what "Twilight" was. He actually texted me after seeing it and said, "Oh, I loved Twilight,' great job, but I prefer when you play a genius." As strange compliments go, that's pretty good!

Despite the isolation, Handley says, she was more comfortable with rural. "One of the reasons I picked winemaking is that I wanted to do something in the country. I never liked cities. It might have to do with getting dressed up and wearing gloves." Straight away she got her hands dirty, studying and working under winemaker Jed Steele at Edmeades, one of the valley's seminal wineries.

He christened the spot with a handmade sign declaring it "Edmeades' Folly.") In her time here she's done a little bit of everything, from driving tractors to fixing broken pumps—"I learned to be mechanical because everything broke"—and she keeps a folding handsaw in her car "because if there's something in the road, you don't always want to wait for the guys with the chain saw." But most of all she's learned the quirks of this place. "It is not a vague valley," she says.
