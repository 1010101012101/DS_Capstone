I had been looking online at different workout classes I could take around the metro and while some of them looked exciting, I wasn't in the mood for an actual workout class. I wanted to get a workout in on Friday but the traditional workout of the gym wasn't going to do. I had been to the gym six of the seven days previous and needed a change of scenery.

Some school districts and states have taken an apathetic, if not defiant, stance in the face of cheating accusations in recent years.
Police arrested more than 100 people during protests in January following the incident in which windows of downtown Oakland businesses were smashed, trash cans and cars were set on fire and police were pelted with bottles.
The Davy: The adorable Davy Jones has been referred to as the band's frontman, but that's mainly because they had to put him in front of the others so you could see him. He was 5-foot-3 (in boots, he said) and originally wanted to be a jockey, but he ended up corralling our hearts with songs like "Daydream Believer" and "Valleri" and the delicate way he smacked that tambourine.
Local studies of climate change impacts are needed to inform management, conservation and adaptation efforts as well as to foster public awareness of the nature of climate change and its consequences, Beier said.
The teachers union president, Joyce Rosenau, said her members aren't happy about the loss of days.

The borders of Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa and Missouri all sit closer to Chicago than much of downstate Illinois -including Metro East. None of those states has a handgun registration law. So even if Mayor Emanuel manages to get Illinois' lawmakers to enact a restriction, what does he propose to do about guns arriving from the other states?
"It was an amazing experience," says Brooks Griffin of his stint with Banana Republic. "I went from a part-time college job styling their windows at the store level to traveling inner Mongolia to source cashmere at the buyer level."

"All the shots were fired by officers," Burris said by telephone Tuesday morning.
And if Kennedy thought abandoning our Cuban allies would save him inconvenience, he was dead wrong. The bungled invasion cemented Castro's ties to the USSR, setting the stage for the nuclear confrontation over missiles on the island the next year -- a crisis fueled by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev's belief that the president who panicked at the Bay of Pigs could be bluffed and rolled.
The protesters entered the building at 888 Turk St. following a late-afternoon rally and march that began in downtown San Francisco on Sunday.
For example, serious attention is now going to “belly fat,” which triggers hormones like insulin and estrogen as well as inflammatory compounds throughout the body: these substances enter the cells and apparently lead to distorted processes that can become cancerous. The fat we carry around our midsection isn’t passive or benign. It could be a major culprit.

In a globalized age, Chinese and American pop culture mix in unexpected ways. Taiwanese singers borrow from hip-hop and R&B. Locked-out NBA players join mainland basketball teams.

I encourage people to come and support the cause, she says. It may sound silly, buying bras for breast cancer.

Krist relies heavily on newspaper accounts, and the storytelling suffers. Quotes abound from Chicago's six daily newspapers, a weekly or two and a couple of out-of-town papers. Krist would have been better off using his own words to carry the story.
Union Rags comes in as the computer's second choice as well as the morning line second choice at 9:2. Union Rags is a visually impressive animal who is bred for the distance, but he is already a twice-beaten favorite in his short career. And Derby horses should not have used up all their excuses in prep races. Despite troubled trips, he had a shot to run down Hansen in the Juvenile last year and Take Charge Indy in the Florida Derby this year. In neither case did he demonstrate the bold late kick of a horse that wants the roses badly. He will benefit from a quick pace on Saturday. He has never missed the board in his career and he likely will be no worse than third on Saturday. Despite his flattering odds of 9:2, he will need to be better on Saturday to hit the line first.
On the way out of the park we passed a glass etching of a mermaid sidling up next to a manatee. "What's that?" my daughter asked pointing to the manatee.
Toast the bread, place some lettuce on two slices, top with the egg salad, then top with tomato slices (if using) and the remaining slices of bread.
A: Your backyard is probably well-compacted. Your best bet will be to rototill it. Water the yard a couple of days before doing this to make it easier for you and the equipment to work the soil. The rototiller should be a rear-tined type with enough horsepower to do the work but not so much that it runs away with you. Avoid front tines. Work the soil to a depth of at least a foot if not more, then add organic matter and some sulfur or gypsum and rototill in. Rough rake until the soil is smooth and then water well to settle the soil. Water a second time. When you can walk on it, do a final smooth raking. You are now ready to lay sod or plant your grass seed. If you decide to xeriscape, the rototilling process still is a good thing to do for a compacted area.
In 1974, Sweeney wrote a letter blasting Ohio's Adult Parole Authority for early shock parole for an armed robber and two heroin peddlers: "It is inconceivable to me that an admitted seller of heroin would ever be considered for parole until the minimum sentence of 10 years is served."

“I started playing the oboe in sixth grade, when my sister and I were living in Texas. Celene started in sixth grade as well, and I was inspired by her playing the oboe. It’s an instrument that a lot of people don’t play, which is also part of why I chose it,” Sophia said.

Davis visited the school Wednesday to talk to the kids, to tell them how he grew what they were eating and answer questions about farming. The kids had lots of questions: "How big is your farm?" (20 acres), "How many people work on it?" (mostly him, with some part-time help), and "How long did it take you to grow what you gave us?" (The lettuce started from seeds in a greenhouse last winter. The apple trees first blossomed in March.)

That would concern me if I were Katz. What if a female juror was not invited to prom and never got over it? She might look at an attractive woman like Katz, and think, "Discrimination? Are you kidding me? What do you know about waiting for the phone to ring?"
For me, I rent cars for getaways when I need something bigger, or when I'm afraid my tires may not last a big road trip. To think I could actually save money, too, is just a bonus.

-- Ben Greene, Special to The Oregonian
I'll give him this: He's tough, he has a quick release, and he's had a few decent playoff games. (He's had a few awful games too, we should point out.) But his accuracy continues to be a problem. He sprays the ball all over the field, and he has been doing it for years. He also doesn't have a big enough arm to let him get away with some of the throws he makes. Sure, he looks great in a GQ spread with his shirt off, but if he wasn't a good-looking guy playing in the media capital of the world, I don't know that people would rave so much about his potential.

"Replenishment might help but it’s barely a Band-Aid when a storm pounds away at the coastal defenses," says Robinson. "Everything is vulnerable. It’s not as if these storms come with any cyclicity or regularity. They’ve come before. They’re going to come again."
Officers also fired "flash-bang" grenades to disperse protesters converging on police as they wrestled people to the ground while trying to make arrests, and used more tear gas Tuesday night to break up the bottle-throwing remnants of what had been a peaceful rally of several thousand.

As for women getting genital cosmetic surgery, while it might sometimes be done when not appropriate or medically necessary, "I don't think that's a common occurrence," she says. "Still, you want to leave the option open for some women who really need it."

The wine also reaffirms that blended as opposed to varietal wines could be the future in California for traditionally French grape varieties such as viognier and roussanne. In addition to the customary suggestions of flowers and stone fruits in the two varieties, the Cuvée Blanc carries a note of intriguing nutmeg. Viognier can be somewhat heavy and viscous on the palate, but in this instance, the acidity and spine of roussanne gives it surprising silkiness.

Taking a negative position doesn't win you many friends in the banking sector. I've worked as a bank analyst for the past 20 years, where my job is to study publicly traded financial firms and decide which ones would make the best investments. This research goes out to institutional investors: mutual fund companies, university endowments, public-employee retirement funds, hedge funds, and other organizations with large amounts of money. But for about the past decade, especially the past five years or so, most big banks haven't been good investments. In fact, they've been terrible investments, down 50%, 60%, 70% or more.

To make matters worse, after over 100 ballots, the council is now deadlocked between two candidates: Pete Smith, a former Marine who emphasized his integrity during the process, and Mike Wagner, a former state senator and businessman whose current claim to fame is to dole out campaign cash, including an attempted donation to one of the current councilmen who would be voting on his appointment. The apparent conflict of interest didn't seem to bother many on council, save Councilman Jerry Walker, but it sure demonstrated the good old boys network is alive and well in Anne Arundel County.

Jefferson County led the state in meth-lab busts in 2009 with 277, which is one reason the county decided to mandate a prescription for pseudoephedrine products, a requirement that applied to its unincorporated areas. But such a piecemeal approach doesn't solve the problem, said Sen. Ryan McKenna, D-Crystal City. McKenna said Jefferson County meth dealers were buying the drugs instead in the county's municipalities or in neighboring counties.
Obama gave his OK after considering available reserves, increased oil production by some countries and global economic conditions.

It's a sprawling, enclosed junkyard littered with secondhand patio furniture and fold-out beach chairs; as a prop, a power boat rests in one corner. It was idyllic. Under the glare of a full moon, I could hardly make out people's faces. All I could see were silhouettes chugging PBRs and clinking cheap cocktails.
Why should we blindly assume the world's top golfer is immune to cheating when top athletes in nearly every other sport (baseball, football, track, swimming, cycling, etc., etc.) have been accused of using performance-enhancers. And, yes, some of these athletes (see Lance Armstrong, Alex Rodriguez, Marion Jones, etc.) were beloved role models just like Tiger.
Newark won the right to host this year, with Boston chosen as the East Regional site next year.

No rate has been set yet, but proposals peg the rate at less than 80 cents per kilowatt hour, which will gradually reduce over time as solar panels get cheaper. In addition, residents will be paid only for the excess electricity they produce, not the amount they consume. The payment will probably show up in their utility bill in the form of a credit.
The "base pavement" on the 2,159-foot-long, 68-foot-wide top deck hasn't been replaced since the bridge opened in 1973. It's tough, but it had to be done.

Early in the testimony at today’s hearing, the topic turned to how to increase the representation of Hispanics in the Legislature — a debate that has shaped much of the process so far.

How do you call an illegal block in the back that never happened (on what should have been a Vikings 96-yard kick return for a TD to make the score 21-10) and then miss Sullivan running downfield illegally on a pass play a few snaps later? DE Dave Tollefson saw Sulluvan from the snap and was pointing him out to referee Jeff Triplette after the whistle. “He was running a route!” an exasperated Tollefson exclaimed after the game. “He was running an out route! Sixty-five!” You couldn’t see this from the Fox replay (the full broadcast is available online, by the way) but Sullivan was very crafty in getting back to the line just as Tollefson was trying to point him out to Triplette. “He was like, ‘Nope, nope, nope,’” Tollefson said while mimicking Triplette’s head shake. It was a very frustrating play for the Giants, who were hit with a personal foul on the sideline when Coughlin tried to plead his case.
I was excited to see last night's premiere of HBO's Game of Thrones for a couple reasons. One, I need a new TV obsession -- until True Blood returns, my viewing lacks a certain pizazz. Two, as you may know, I have a soft spot for fantasy.However, no one told me this fantasy comes with a caveat: It seems to be just for men.

He hoped it would open in four months.

Attempting to shake off a wave of national criticism about his spiritless play two nights before, James ran a backdoor cut and threw down a two-handed dunk on the Cavs' first offensive possession to attempt to set a tone.

"It's improving, but it's nowhere near where we need to be. And that's something we're going to continue to press. It's not just the quarterbacks. It's everybody. It starts with the linemen, the receivers, everybody. That's something the entire offense needs to be more efficient with. You're starting to see glimpses of what it's supposed to look like. The guys are really buying into it. We're trying to play as fast as we can, but what we stress as coaches is not only do we want to be the fastest offense in the country, we want to be the most efficient and the one that executes the best."

Other than a short, chilly run to Macedon Landing the next morning, that was it for our canal adventure. Because I can't say it better, I'll cede the last word to someone named Carol, who had written in the log book that "this trip has surely strengthened our bond with special friends.

Other items, such as the Nepal-style chow mein (vegetable, chicken or lamb, $7.95-$9.95), seemed less remarkable. The difference between Nepali and Chinese chow mein is the addition of ingredients such as curry powder, cilantro, tomato and -- if you really want to be authentic -- buffalo meat. It is practically a national dish in Nepal, but we didn't find our chicken version very distinctive. Certainly it was more refined than the greasy stuff you would find at divey Chinese joints, but we were looking for the herbs and spices to be dialed up a touch.

Oregon's governor, John Kitzhaber, stopped the impending execution of two-time convicted killer Gary Haugen, granting a "temporary reprieve ... for the duration of my term in office." Haugen's death sentence had been the subject of extensive review and the prisoner himself had argued that he should die. The governor should either have allowed execution to proceed or commuted the sentence. He did neither, treating the prisoner, the victims' families, and the dozens of court and prison officials in this case with cruel irresponsibility.
"There will be fair weather fans who are actually Tebow fans and will be trading in their Broncos jerseys for Tebow's No. 15 Jets jerseys," said longtime Jets fans Eric Haug, whose disenchantment is obvious. "What team calls a press conference for a backup quarterback? When does that ever happen?"

Why is this happening, and why now? Obviously, the global financial crisis brought the failures of the economics profession into stark relief.

"The fact that the border hasn't been secured yet raises the question of whether people who want comprehensive reform are holding that hostage," Kyl said. "The sense seems to be that 'If we secured the border, then you all wouldn't have any incentive to compromise with us on comprehensive reform.'

2. When do you take 3-D scans? While a 3-D scan -- called a dental CBCT (for cone-beam computed tomography) -- shows terrific, cross-sectional images of your teeth and jaw, the radiation dose can be four to 67 times higher than conventional X-rays. Two major dental groups recommend CBCT only when regular X-rays won't provide enough information, such as before an implant. Experts disagree about it for planning orthodontia, so discuss it with your dentist.

If you time it right, you can have lunch across the street at Ulupalakua Ranch General Store, where burgers, beef or buffalo, are barbecued on a big outdoor grill from mid-morning to mid-afternoon.

I’d just spent several days preparing a preview feature about the Latin Grammy Awards that highlighted one of the Latin music scene’s premier rivalries — Los Angeles vs. Miami — since the awards had just been moved to the West Coast because of fear of anti-Castro protests over the scheduled appearance of nominees such as Cuban pianist Chucho Valdés.

The native Brittany oyster — biologically singular and sovereign among varieties — fell prey to gluttony as well as disease, hard winters and predators such as starfish even more voracious than humans, it seems. In the late 19th century they were dying out when a couple of good things happened: French scientist Victor Coste found a way to cultivate them by laying beds made out of tiles for the baby oysters to latch onto; the technique did not affect the taste because oysters are sedentary, equally good cultivated or naturally bedded.
Questions aside, Yawger says none of the recent revelations has shaken his view of what happened on Division Street at Dearborn Street around 3 a.m. on April 25, 2004 - nor his conclusion that criminal charges might have been warranted if there had been a positive identification.
Ocean City police treat the area like the boardwalk or Jolly Roger Amusement Park. "There's almost nothing to compare it to in Ocean City or Delmarva," said Mike Levy, a police spokesman.

What the heck is the deal with Pablo Sandoval's hands? He went on the disabled list last year with a broken hamate bone in his right hand, and now it's the same bone on the left - caused by nothing more, apparently, than a really hard swing. The impact of this loss is immeasurable, for Sandoval appeared headed for a .330-plus season, doses of big-time power and a spot on the All-Star team.

The grandfather or his widow could have cleared out the box long ago. Last year, a reader discovered a safe deposit box owned by his late mother almost 20 years after her death. He spent money to get a court order and then, because her key had been lost in the intervening years, spent another $100 or so to drill open the box. When the box was opened, it contained only a paper clip.

If the Cavs decide to go for the playoffs, one of these guys either has to step up or Grant is going to have to try to make a move. That's easier said than done, of course -- and no, Dwight Howard is not an option.
And, Barry, it is not enough to point to all the things pastors are allowed to do to justify the one restriction on their free exercise of religion. As an example, it did not soothe the black community to point to some of the drinking fountains, lunch counters and schools open to them when they were still prohibited by racial segregation laws from equal access to all facilities. Nor does it placate pastors to remind them of all the things they can speak on, except for one issue.

Indeed, all the songs on Let It Die share a palpable melodic sturdiness. "I really feel like the melody is the bones, the marrow in the bones, the cells in the marrow in the bones of a song," Feist notes. "If it's not there, the rest of it has nothing to stick to. I don't understand people who think the studio could do something for you that the shower stall can't. If a song can be sung in the shower and hold its own weight, it's alive, and no amount of studio trickery can take that away. But on the flip side, if you go and sit in a studio and hope that something is going to come jumping out of the machines at you, then that's a way I don't really understand."

Evenings stretched on forever. Cotton-tailed rabbits seemed fearless; lambs with black faces and wobbly legs bleated in chorus as I walked by. Larks swooped; I saw two red foxes loping across freshly tilled fields and a large badger cleaving to the underside of a yew hedge as it ambled toward the wood.

Strengths Benjamin is a good route runner and understands how to get open at the top of routes and use his explosive movements to his advantage. As a returner, he is a "one cut and go" runner who can break for daylight. The key to his game as a receiver is his ability to get open, and he doesn't shy away from contact despite his stature. He will be a true deep threat at the next level who runs crisp intermediate routes, as well, and can be productive if he gets off the line of scrimmage.

Mr. al-Awlaki has been described as a high-ranking figure in al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, an offshoot of the Pakistan-based al-Qaida founded by Osama bin Laden that officials believe poses nearly as grave a threat to the U.S. homeland as the original group. Capturing or killing him had been high on the Obama administration’s list of priorities for at least a year.
Based on the disclosures I've been reading, CEOs are a little clubbier in St. Louis than in the rest of the nation.

That's a visionary notion, and it sits at the center of "The Angel Esmeralda," as it does throughout DeLillo's work. As for the stories, some are more realized than others — "Midnight in Dostoevsky" and "The Starveling," especially, seem a little forced, despite what they have to say about the contradictions of narrative — but that's only to be expected from 30 years of odds and ends. More to the point is that in this collection, as in his novels, DeLillo challenges us to see a world defined by our projections, a world in which the only reality is the one we create. Or, as he asserts here: "In our privatest mind … there is only chaos and blur. We invented logic to beat back our creatural selves."

"The biggest thing we can be is a calming influence," said Langenbrunner, who won Stanley Cups with Dallas in 1999 and New Jersey in 2003. "It is the playoffs, but it is the same game. It's the team that can make the other team crack. For us, it's just staying with that focus. Guys have done a pretty good job of staying on an even keel all year. Some guys might get antsy, and we'll give them a little pat on the back to calm them down. I don't think it will be that big of an adjustment. Once you get through that first shift, you're a playoff veteran."

Ratings note: The film contains gory violence and strong language.
Capital punishment imposes ruinous costs on states, it can't be reversed if an inmate is later exonerated, it's highly questionable whether it can be carried out in a humane manner, and it protects society from killers no better than putting them away for life. As for the possibility of racial bias in sentencing, there probably isn't a reliable way to eliminate it. North Carolina is going through the back door when, with more honesty and fewer complications, it could go through the front.

Even China's emerging eco-activists admit that on paper it has decent environmental laws. But enforcement remains sporadic, and in the pecking order of China's one-party government -- where local and regional officials are essentially junior executives out to impress the home office in Beijing -- nothing makes a career shine like presiding over strong economic growth. Some top officials have suggested using a "green GDP" to evaluate local officials, but the idea has yet to catch fire.

The evening also marked another chapter in the longtime love-hate relationship between Joan Quicksilver, one of our town's leading PR mavens, and a former gossip columnist.

The Tigers are so good that they just whipped the Mud Hens, 8-3, in a statement game for both clubs. The statement: "Can the season start already? Please?"

Dr. Dwyer, leader of the expedition, set out to find help to extricate our truck from the orange grove. Gentry and I set to work on the orange tree with our machetes and rather quickly removed all the branches and threw them out of the way. Then we carefully cut off the trunk at its base, running at the last second as the truck came down with a huge thud. The truck was now resting on the thick trunk of the tree and had to be freed by using a jack.

When I explained all this to my companion for one of these forays into the beating heart of Xfinity Live!, she raised an eyebrow. At that point in the night, she had already been groped by two drunken men and pushed aside at the crowded bar by another drunken guy. She had stood on a floor strewn with broken glass watching a fat, hairy dude ride a mechanical bull. “I don’t think it’s such a bad idea that the people in this bar are lured away from Center City!” she shouted over the din.
Dynamite had been used nationally before -- most notably in the great fire that swept Baltimore just two years before. The results were mixed, but the real problem was that when Baltimore called for help, the hose couplings from other departments did not fit the Baltimore hydrants. The controversy over the couplings obscured any troubles with dynamite.

Finally, for hospital coverage, a combination of funding sources could be employed, primarily member premiums and existing programs to subsidize the costs for the uninsured. Maryland has the "all payer system," whereby the cost of uncompensated care is borne by all payers to a given hospital through higher rates for insured patients at the same institution. In the rest of the country, charity hospitals providing uncompensated care are mostly reimbursed by Medicare. We argue that eligibility for hospital care provided without billing the patient be limited to those with incomes above Medicaid eligibility levels up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level (between $28,000 and $66,000 for a family of four, for example). Further subsidies could be provided by progressive county or state governments in the form of tax credits or the like.

Instead of blaming our city in times of crisis, we need to get involved. First of all, the Public Square location of Club Allure, which has had shootings before, has to be questioned. We as a people can decide what we want or don't want in our city. Violence of this kind has no place in our new residential/mixed-use downtown neighborhoods. As the senior pastor of the Old Stone Church, Allure's next-door neighbor, I hold the right, officially, to oppose the liquor license for that location. At this point, I see no reason to sign anything but "opposed." The recent Warehouse Bar Owners Memorandum of Understanding and forthcoming nightclub legislation will help bar owners care for their patrons, within and beyond their venues, as well.

And it gets worse. A news report Friday said we could see $8 (that's dollars! Eight of them!) per gallon by the end of the year if Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz, disrupting global oil supplies and thereby creating a serious shortage of number 8s at gas stations everywhere. Attendants will have to start gluing 3s together, mirror-image style. And then not only will gravity be broken but, because 3 plus 3 will then equal 8, so will mathematics.

Common problems unite the big-city districts with the most prevalent suspicious scores: Many faced state takeovers if scores didn’t improve quickly. Teachers’ pay or even their continued employment sometimes depended on test performance. And their students — mostly poor, mostly minority — were among those needing the most help.
"What happened to the History Channel? There are virtually no shows about history there anymore. They have converted to just about 100 percent reality shows.

Thankfully, the County's transportation policy board (the Washington County Coordinating Committee) agrees for the most part that the TDT needs to be reined in for small businesses moving into existing buildings.

Edward Coffield, the producer of the awards festivities, is working on getting actual statuettes made for this year's winners and also last year's, who are still waiting.

needs can wait until after the season. How the next 6 weeks play out will determine if the club sees a greater short-term need for a closer or infield help. Both are in play and potentially doable. Franklin's lease on the ninth inning appears over. The organization must now ask whether a contending club is prepared to turn the ninth inning over to a relatively inexperienced closer or even carry a committee arrangement forward.

1:33 p.m. UPDATE I've changed the first paragraph to from "pretty much tore down" to "might have torn down." To be fair to everyone involved, it's too early to close the door on a possible return to the Giants. A lot of variables are involved.

Benjamin Martin, in case you forgot, was the protagonist in the 2000 Hollywood film "The Patriot" played by Mel Gibson. Ginormica would probably win a brawl against any of the other Patriots in this list by default as they are notably respectable and genteel fellows who would never hit a woman.

Cockrell�s Mercantile is a charming country �village� devoted to modern cookware, bakeware, dinnerware and gourmet food. The nooks and crannies of five cottages and barns are filled to the brim. The main building is a 115-year-old general store just off of U.S. 50 between Lee�s Summit and Lone Jack. Other buildings include the Fiesta Cottage, devoted to vivid displays of richly colored Fiesta dinnerware, and the Morton House, with clever bakeware and baking supplies stacked floor to ceiling, including ingredients from King Arthur Flour. The Cockrell Annex displays flowerpots, and the Cockrell Cottage has gift items, including a Vera Bradley room. The mercantile�s original owner was John Perucca of Pryde�s Old Westport fame. Now Becky Glaze, a former Pryde�s employee, and her husband, Chris, stock, run, maintain and live on the property with their two children. Most people learn about the store through word of mouth: �It�s hard to explain what we have here,� says Becky Glaze, who has a terrific eye for detail, so allow plenty of time to work your way through all the buildings. Not sure what to do with the non-cooks of the family? Civil War buffs will also be interested in the history of Cockrell, which was home to traders and frontiersmen. There are plenty of history links on the website, www.cockrellmercantile.com.

Wendell Maxey: Too much money - that's all we heard last summer when Portland made Wes Matthews their marquee free agent acquisition. But not even halfway through the season, Wes showcased his versatility in full and gave good reason why he's worth all that big bank. And for those fans who really didn't know much about Wes before arriving in Rip City, they were left cheering for more as he helped carry the Blazers and represented the team at All-Star weekend in Los Angeles. Okay, so Matthews didn't have the most stellar postseason, but right now it's more about where Matthews is going instead of where he has been. A clear cut mainstay in Nate McMillan's game plan, Matthews might be heading back to coming off the bench next season - Brandon Roy appears dead set on reclaiming a starting job. Now, will Wes embrace a sixth man role? Knowing Matthews, he will take pride and leave his mark on the second unit. No doubt about it.

Wells Fargo and Citigroup acknowledged using outside firms to collect debts owed by the deceased. However, both banks said they don't try to collect from family members who are not responsible for the debts. Citigroup said it prohibits outside collectors from demanding payment from survivors or suggesting that they are liable. A Discover spokesman said the company requires that family members be told up front that they are not liable for a dead relative's unpaid debt. J.P. Morgan declined to comment. At Nordstrom, the retailer uses an outside agency to collect such debts, but asks the agency to contact families only to find out the estate representative's contact information, according to a spokeswoman.

He's right, and that warning applies to much more than dating sites. By its nature, the Internet returns piecemeal glimpses of us -- small slices of our professional life, hobbies or youthful misdeeds, viewed out of context. The problem with potential employers Googling young job candidates and finding pictures of their bravest keg stands isn't so much the behavior itself -- soon enough plenty of folks in HR will have keg-stand snapshots of their own -- as it is that they might not find a record of that person's more-lasting accomplishments. A personal Web page is an opportunity to tell your story and balance out other narratives that you can't control.
