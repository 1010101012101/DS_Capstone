A lot of the bougainvilleas in the Valley are slow to come back and bloom at their previous abundance. If you are fertilizing them, go light on the nitrogen as this will produce abundant vegetative growth and fewer colorful bracts.
Since CARS began on July 24, it has been riddled with problems. The government drastically underestimated demand, so as buyers rushed to get vehicles, a computer system set up to handle applications crashed almost immediately. The initial $1 billion funding that had been expected to last until November was nearly exhausted in a week.

The one element that is relatively subdued is the engine itself. It never really roars, but when you start pushing it, the engine sounds like a blender trying to puree Gilbert Gottfried. Any expected internal combustion noise is dominated by the sounds of forced induction, turbine wail and air being sucked and pumped into the right places. That's not to say it doesn't sound cool, but it's a 21st-century cool better enjoyed by a crowd raised on pixelated racecars in their living room than fans of naturally aspirated power.

Eventually, he'll have to choose between Jaroslav Halak and Brian Elliott to be his starting goalie for the playoffs, and so far, precious little separates the two.

Halak and Elliott - or, if you prefer, Elliott and Halak - keep making a case for themselves.

Bonello also gets too cutesy with quadruple screens, out-of-order scenes, modern music and touches (echoing Sofia Coppola's take on "Marie Antoinette"), and a languid pace that needlessly drags out the proceedings. As with many so-called art films, "House of Pleasures" is visually alluring, sometimes erotic, sometimes captivating, but ultimately tedious, the victim of a director's refusal to say "cut."
A: Not very much, only in the sense that there are new opportunities. I still think that what I learned at the dinner table a long time ago still makes sense. There is an obligation to give back. You can perform it many ways. You don't have to run for office, although that's one way. You can be on the board of your local school district. You can be a member of a private charity.

Ohioans voted in November to nullify the federal insurance mandate, but the practical effect of that vote is in question. The nation's highest court is expected to rule on the federal challenge this summer, with oral arguments in March. The attorney general of Florida, joined by 25 colleagues including Ohio's Mike DeWine, brought the federal challenge.
But Lewis said Hampton's public courses didn't see the sharp decrease in rounds played during the recession because they cater to budget players.

RUFUS Wainwright recently wrote an opera, “Prima Donna,” that played at BAM in February, but he’s returned to more standard pop fare with the new album “Out of the Game,” produced by Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse) and backed by the Dap-Kings. The song “Barbara” has a nice ’70s Philly soul/pop vibe — a mash-up of Todd Rundgren and the Delfonics. You can see Wainwright in bell-bottoms as he sings about “drinking rosé in the rain/Or listening to the same song over and over again.”
And the employment gain for March was revised down 8,000 to 201,000. The report is "surprising, disappointing and is going to fuel speculation that the economy has downshifted," said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers LLC which prepares the report based on ADP payrolls from 344,000 clients. However, he said employment trails economic growth so the lower jobs numbers reflect the lower-than-expected 2.2 percent growth in the first quarter gross domestic product.

Summer has become a movie season with traditions as customary as Mardi Gras. Now is the time movie theaters dial up the air conditioning and dial down the originality. Sequels, remakes, reboots and adaptations are the norm for warm-weather viewing, and never more so than now. Several films opening in the next three months boast titles ending in 3 ("Madagascar 3"), III ("Men in Black III") or even 3DD (a nod to the abundantly voluptuous actresses in the latest installment of the "Piranha" franchise). If you count the previous Bourne movies, "The Bourne Legacy" is a 4. Add up the Marvel superheroes' earlier appearances and "The Avengers" is a 7.
The Wild West Picture Show Productions company will also produce the movie.

An entire movement has grown up around the factoid that American women make about 80 percent of the pay of men. It is a reliable talking point of Democrats who insist the country is racked by a "War on Women." A raft of proposed legislation purports to remedy the discrimination exposed by the damning number. It is the only bad statistic with a day devoted to it, "Equal Pay Day," which falls in April to signify how much longer women have to work into the new year to make what men earned in the previous year. Tradition says that the day must be marked with wailing and gnashing of teeth, and lots of press releases from advocacy organizations.

In growing numbers, people with Alzheimer's, migraines, autism, epilepsy and more are picking up paintbrushes or putting drawing pencils to paper. Some are artists like Sherwood who continue to produce prolific portfolios after brain damage and find their work dramatically changed. Others turn to art only after a disease has set in, and they may even be inspired by it. Both groups are helping researchers unravel the complicated and intertwined ways that biology produces creativity — including the contributions of inhibition, obsession and other personality traits. "There are virtually no situations where brain damage makes things better," says Anjan Chatterjee, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, who is working on a book about art and the brain. But art is, he adds, one of the few complex aspects of human cognition that doesn't necessarily get worse.

What is one of the most important issues facing your generation? How to combat the negative aspects of a highly technologically developed society. Yes, Internet and cellphones can be used for great things and can be extremely useful.

*AL Central: Outscored by 64 runs in April, this is the one division without a strong team. The Tigers looked to be a force until they lost eight of the last 10 games, falling to 11-11. Their lineup was better at the end of 2011 with Victor Martinez and Delmon Young supporting Miguel Cabrera than it has been with Fielder there, and the defense has allowed 10 unearned runs, the second most in the AL. The starting rotation could be better when Doug Fister returns but Max Scherzer and Rick Porcello have been as inconsistent as always. The White Sox have had stronger starting pitching than expected, thanks to Jake Peavy, Chris Sale and Philip Humber, and could stick around for the long haul. This week’s series with the equally ambitious Indians will be interesting.

When the stressful situation is resolved, blood pressure comes back down.

I ordered the mahi mahi, which was described as extremely fresh. Indeed, it was fresh before it was frozen somewhere between the time it was pulled out of the ocean and delivered to Dutch Flat. The fish was small and dull, but the biggest distraction on the plate was the salsa topping the fish  a mix of chopped pineapple and minced raw white onions.

Toughest back-to-back: There are a couple of candidates. A road game at Philadelphia followed by a home game against New England is no picnic. The games against the two Texas teams – the Cowboys (Oct.14) and Texans (Oct.21) – won’t be an easy two-game stretch either. But the vote here goes to the back-to-back road games against the Steelers (Nov.18) and San Diego Chargers (Nov.25). Those are two tough matchups to begin with but when you take into account that the Ravens will get back to Baltimore from Pittsburgh very early Monday morning and then have to make the West Coast trip out to California early for a Sunday afternoon game, it gets even more challenging.

Or does he (try to) include you in the banter?
Actually, that’s wrong. The case of Lochner vs. New York was decided in 1905, and the Supreme Court continued to strike down laws that sought to regulate economic conditions until the mid-1930s.

The prosecution is a naked exercise in attempting to punish a loathsome man for his loathsomeness. As such it is an offense against the rule of law, which depends on clear rules and dispassionate judgments. Every wrong -- even flagrant wrongs, played out in public and involving mind-boggling deceit -- is not a crime. By stretching the laws to try to reach Edwards, the government is creating the predicate for future ambiguous, politicized prosecutions, perhaps of figures much less blameworthy than the reviled man currently in the dock.

After renting a car in the bustling capital of Lisbon, we headed north to the seaside hamlet of Baleal. Except among surfers, Baleal isn't nearly as well known as the nearby town of Óbidos, a must-see medieval enclave that's several miles inland. For us, however, Baleal's lure was Casa das Marés, a welcoming outpost perched on a narrow spit of land between the craggy Atlantic coast a few steps to the west and a tranquil beach and bay a few steps to the east.

Ohio State and Michigan State clearly distanced themselves from the rest of the Big Ten. They are the conference's upper echelon this season.

2. The Avengers (1998): Ralph Fiennes is a good fit as John Steed, but who decided Uma Thurman -- and not a handful of other British actresses -- was best for Emma Peel? And even though Fiennes seems right, he acts as if his limo is double-parked. A mess of a film that could have been fun.
Mike Acker: There's probably no figure more polarizing in the Blazer organization than Nate McMillan. Fans seem to either love him or hate him. I trend towards the former. He is a bit stubborn on his rotations, and has a tendency to take hot shooters out of the game. I like the extension Nate was given, and I expect (insert new GM here) will give him a least a couple of years to make good before handing him his walking papers. Nate is the foundation of this team. If guys can stay healthy, we may finally get the chance to see Sarge work his magic with a roster full of experienced, un-injured players.

Similarly, Congress has repeatedly altered benefits. From 1950 to 1972, it increased them nine times, including a doubling in the early 1950s. In 1972, it indexed benefits to inflation. People didn't complain when benefits rose, but possible cuts now trigger howls that a "contract" is being broken. Not so. In a 1960 decision (Flemming v. Nestor), the Supreme Court expressly rejected the argument that people have a contractual right to Social Security. It cited the 1935 Social Security Act: "The right to alter, amend or repeal any provision of this Act is hereby reserved to Congress." Congress can change the program whenever it wants.
