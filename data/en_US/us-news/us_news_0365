"This is very frustrating," said Hardis, who singled out other districts such as Orange and Shaker Heights that also did not make the list.
In fact, Pazani may be a pasta-lovers find. The restaurant bills itself a trattoria but it looks like a suburban strip mall sub shop. You place your order at the counter and take a number to your table. It's as informal as a pizza-sub joint, feels like an after-the-soccer-game, bring-the-kids kind of place. But it tastes like a white tablecloth place.
In November 2009, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood released a plan for issuing regulations that address many of the NTSB recommendations. The only recommendation that has been fully implemented is a ban on texting by bus and truck drivers. The department also has proposed rules requiring seatbelts for all bus passengers and electric onboard recorders, and a ban on handheld cellphone use by bus and truck drivers while driving. Those rules have not been made final.
The speaker at the PHL's concussion training, Dr. Tom Martin, a neuropsychologist from the University of Missouri, reminded the coaches that younger athletes are particularly at risk of brain injuries.

I had less than overwhelming service at brunch on the patio last spring myself. Perhaps someone took those comments to heart, or perhaps owners or managers decided a change was needed. Whatever the reasons, on my three December visits, servers were accommodating, charming and reasonably efficient, even during a weekend brunch when the 60-seat restaurant was packed.

Both of these recipes call for the removal of exterior leaves -- the very ones that are so fun to eat when enjoying a whole artichoke. But they don't go to waste. I toss them into a bowl of cold water with some lemon juice, and the leaves keep nicely until lunch the next day, when I'll steam the loose leaves and dunk them in sauce.

"(The questions were) if we're going to do this on our terms, what's the experience that is going to be worth our time and energy, and what can we contribute to the community that isn't already out there?" Yarbrough recalls. "We were really trying to figure out a communal identity, both in work ethic and in our taste in material, chiseling away what was extraneous or wasn't of interest to all of us."

Icebergs aren't the only draw. East along Route 510, the Labrador Coastal Drive, a gorgeously spare landscape unfolds. The winding road from L'Anse-au-Clair to Red Bay takes you past dwarf conifers and salmon-rich rivers, aboriginal burial mounds and hulking boulders. This pristine glacial field saw the retreat of the continental ice sheet a mere 10,000 to 15,000 years ago.

It's not just the news itself, which can vary from hopeful to horrific and back again in just a couple of days. It's that investors have been inconsistent in how they react, sometimes shrugging off what seems like significant developments and at other times seizing on what seems piecemeal.
Several years ago, three street cameras were installed in the Central Neighborhood. The federally funded Weed and Seed program paid for the cameras, at a cost of several thousand dollars. One camera was placed less than twenty yards from Jackson's shop.

Policies created to achieve greater levels of homeownership, like the mortgage interest deduction, have had devastating effects on the housing market as a whole, artificially inflating demand and driving up prices. It's good Governor O'Malley is finally taking these policies on.
Many legislators do serious work. But many others spend too little time trying to fix the state and too much time crowing about bills that are little more than press releases intended to grab attention.
I work all year long on just trying to make sure I talk casually with all the players I think can win the Masters sometime in their lives. Not for just this coming April, but I can file it away for six or seven years later and when they are going to walk up that 72nd hole at Augusta, I can actually take that moment and document it the way it should be.
Word later came that the same fence had made Jones an offer he couldn't refuse, this time regarding a perfume warehouse in Carlstadt,: If he and his cohorts could "get four trucks of perfumes, he will give them $500,000."
While state, county and city governments are struggling with budget problems, most of the blame for those problems has been laid at the feet of the regular, usually union, employees for their pay, benefits and pensions.

A: Yeah, but this Heat team has to be bigger than such concerns. The Pacers are in their glad-to-be-here phase.
But garnering four stars isn't about performing perfectly. Things happen. I once gave a great review to a restaurant that accidentally knocked a glass of red wine in my lap. You could pour a magnum of Cabernet in my lap if you serve me Nugent's cheese course. The scrim of nutty/funky Pleasant Ridge Reserve (a Wisconsin cheese made in the style of Gruyere) propped up on a billowing spinnaker of a tapioca crisp enriched with a drizzle of celery truffle caponata and dollop of mascarpone cream is the best composed cheese course I've had since Dale Levitski's "Grilled Cheese" at Sprout.

So how McMillan handles these options, particularly at the close of games, will likely go a long way to how long the Blazers season lasts.
A few other quotes from Reese from the interview:
Here are both spots:
"We joked that it only seems right that the world's most famous wolf makes an appearance in California and the paparazzi come out," said Rob Klavins of the conservation group Oregon Wild, which held a contest for children around the world to name the wolf and came up with Journey.
“In a couple days,” Taylor said, “I might look back and say this was a great year; we had a great year, but right now it’s just a bad feeling. A bad feeling being so close, working so hard for four years to get to this one game, and we’re finally there and we just came up short.”
Indeed Barack Obama, the "peace president," has greatly escalated George W. Bush's wars in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, earning him the approving epithet "warrior president" from a New York Times columnist who remarked that he is "one of the most militarily aggressive American leaders in decades."

Many European leaders agree. Hollande will not start printing money right away, because the euro means he cannot, but he is certainly going to argue for "quantitative easing" (as we now call reflation).
øThe sedan's cosmetic changes include new window trim and rocker panels and modified front and rear ends with new lighting.
University City residents have been disenfranchised in the entire planning process for the Loop trolley. A final plan needs to be developed and put to University City voters. They should have the final say on a project that would have such a significant impact on the city.

“So instead of being centered over their foot, they moved it further backward and further toward the opposite side of their body, giving them a more extended stance compared to the low-friction surface. Those results suggest that these changes could lead to the higher incidents of ACL injuries seen on the high-friction surface.”
As far as the "multiple" championships go that the abdicated "King" thinks will ratify greatness, is that really so? Until the rise of Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson in the 1980s and '90s, Jerry West and Oscar Robertson were commonly considered the best guards in NBA history. They won two championships between them. Years of excellence established their reputations, despite the obstacles the Bill Russell dynasty presented.
A landline would likely remain available as long as it is bundled with other services as part of a more expensive package, Smalz said.

Jim Lentz, president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc., acknowledged at a congressional hearing this week that Toyota had a weakness in handling information. "We didn't do a very good job of sharing information across the globe. Most of the information was one-way.

Siu mai ($1.50/3) are a bit misshapen, but have a well-seasoned filling of chopped pork. Don't miss a very good version of egg custard tarts (60 cents each), large with a dark and rich custard and flaky pastry.
Operating on a tip, The New York Times reported that "60 Minutes" planned to excise Wigand's interview from its tobacco expose.

The Durango Herald reported Tuesday (http://bit.ly/KoBmh9) that Louie Albert Lucero was convicted of 14 counts, including assault and false imprisonment.
The fourth contest, the Feb. 28 primary in South Carolina, is potentially decisive. Earlier this year, the state's Republican Party raised a legal challenge to the traditional open primary, seeking to limit participation to registered Republicans. Although a federal judge ruled that the primary must remain open, state Republicans are appealing, and pointing out that courts have generally permitted parties to regulate their own internal processes. In 2000, of course, moderate Republicans and independents flocked to Sen. John McCain in the South Carolina primary, almost derailing George W. Bush's campaign. If South Carolina Republicans prevail in closing their primary, Texas Gov. Rick Perry is likely to have a big advantage over seemingly more moderate Mitt Romney.
Hill had pleaded guilty to robbing the Country Club Bank in Leavenworth with co-defendant Donnique H. Kelley, 22, of Kansas City. They were arrested shortly after the robbery when they lead police on a high-speed chase that ended in downtown Kansas City.
Here the individual elements — tender pork shank, wild boar sausage, duck confit — sat atop the aforementioned heirloom beans, which on this night were underseasoned and undercooked. They also lacked the creaminess of an old-school cassoulet. Too bad. Despite the excellent meats, the dish never exceeded its individual parts.
"It's a pretty unique boot," Williams said. "A few companies have dabbled with this interchangeable traction but they were more on the lines of screwing spikes onto your golf shoes."
"We're a contract city at this point," said City Manager Laura Snideman, using the term for municipalities that pay others for services. "The transformation has been really hard, and it can be very emotional, but I believe Half Moon Bay is better for it."
Best Quote to Summarize the Series: Elena asks Damon why he doesn’t let people see the good in him. He responds: “Because when people see good, they expect good. And I don’t want to have to live up to anyone’s expectations.”
There is also the strange and bizarre on the schedule, including the Chicago-produced film "Sci Fi Sol," a musical about a lonely video game designer who creates a rock star character who comes to life and takes over the world (10:30 p.m. Saturday), plus the stoner comedy "High Road" (7 p.m. Friday), a mostly improvised film from former Chicagoan and Upright Citizens Brigade founder Matt Walsh (who comes to town for the screening), about a failed drummer-turned-idiot-pot-dealer, co-starring "Saturday Night Live's" Abby Elliott. "I think it's very common," Walsh said when I rang him up last week, "that group art, like a band or an improv group, inevitably some people quit and get real jobs, and there's always someone in the group who struggles longer with that. And I think the main character in our movie suffers from that, calling his friends sell-outs." And be sure to check out "Parallax Sounds" (5:30 p.m. Saturday) an abstract music documentary conceived by Italian experimental filmmaker Augusto Contento, who explores "Chicago's singular urban landscape through the prism of its adventurous '90s music scene," as the fest's website puts it, "part sonic history, part tone poem, and 100 percent paean to the rhythm and energy of a great American city."

I was shocked to learn that the majority of chemicals produced in the United States are virtually unregulated for their effects on our health. And the law intended to protect us from harmful chemicals hasn't been updated since the 1970s. As a result, cancer clusters appear across the country and the products we use every day contain notable levels of toxins.
The joke was the only time all day that Romney directly acknowledged his GOP rivals. Instead, he delivered a version of his closing argument speech railing against Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. Biden criticized Romney in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Friday.

One of the early job-related Xtranormal videos was "iPhone4 vs. HTC Evo," in which a salesman unsuccessfully tries to convince a stubborn customer desperate for a sold-out iPhone to consider a different phone. As the salesman lists the benefits, such as a bigger screen, faster Internet speeds, cheaper monthly bill — it "prints money, it can grant up to three wishes, even if one of those wishes is for an iPhone" — the customer just replies, "I don't care." Posted last June on YouTube, it has racked up almost 13 million hits.
4. Use a deep fryer or oversize pot on the stovetop. Fill one-third with canola oil -- the empty upper portion of the pot will allow for foaming and splattering. Heat oil to 350 degrees, or use this method to tell when the oil is hot enough: Drop a potato slice into the cold oil, and when the potato turns brown, the oil is ready. Drop potato slices into the heated oil. Do not overcrowd the pot, and watch closely while cooking. Remove slices with a slotted spoon or spatula when they turn light brown, about 3 minutes. Drain in a metal basket or colander. Continue cooking in batches.

GB is, as a rule, preceded by a mild respiratory or digestive-tract illness three weeks before its symptoms appear. The assumption is that the preceding illness primes the immune system to make antibodies, the immune system's ammunition, against nerve insulation. The first signs of trouble are peculiar sensations in the toes or feet. Then muscle weakness sets in, starting in the feet and legs, and ascending up the body. GB can paralyze the breathing muscles. When that happens, the patient must be put on a ventilator.

At the beginning, Palin was given plenty of reasons for grievance. After her selection as John McCain's running mate, some in the press focused unkind attention on her family and faith. From a human perspective, her defensive reaction was understandable. In a memorable convention speech, Palin returned a volley of fist-shaking populism. On the campaign trail, huge Republican crowds -- far larger than McCain generally drew -- rewarded Palin's feistiness. It was the heartland (including the tundra) against the coasts; real Americans against the elites. Following the election, a procession of radio and cable appearances further simplified and purified Palin's persona. Positive reinforcement had done its predictable work. The candidate became a caricature. The caricature became a celebrity.

If memory serves, in years past, pro football players used to form a circle and say a prayer before or after a game. When some players, past and present, made a good play during a game, they would kneel or point toward the sky to give thanks. No one got upset about those things, so why are people getting so disturbed about Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow praying (“Another victory keeps Tebow in the spotlight,” Jan. 10)?

Nearly two decades and two more volumes later, Mr. Caro has shredded any quaint stereotypes. The Lyndon Johnson he gives us—not as lovable as Fenstemaker but certainly more human—is a crass and visceral political animal half-deranged by the memory of childhood humiliations . . . but also a shrewd, affecting and thoroughly effective standard-bearer for progressive ideals. In the process, Mr. Caro's almost monastic 36-year-long dedication to his subject has succeeded in winning over virtually all of his critics, including almost every Johnson confidant.

The troubles for al-Assad and Ahmadinejad could give ulcers to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who has his hands full with serious problems of his own. A U.N. Special Tribunal has indicted four Hezbollah members in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Nasrallah had desperately tried to prevent this from happening. That's because the indictment rips the veneer off Hezbollah's claim to work only for the protection of Lebanon. Most Lebanese know his militia was created by Iran, armed by Tehran and Damascus, and worked at the behest of the Iranian and Syrian regimes. Hariri's killers sought to protect Syrian control of Lebanon by eliminating its most effective critic.

I looked through the cupboards to see what could be repurposed from crafts past. Always do this before embarking on a craft project; it's often amazing to see what you already own or can reuse. I found tea lights, votive holders and tall candlesticks. Brown and green tapers were purchased, red votives and small white tea lights were leftovers from last year. Pine cones were found in the back yard. They were divided into groups: one pile was painted red, the other silver. There were plenty of acorns, too, but they looked too small to make much of a visual presence so a bag of walnuts was procured at the local farmers market. The walnuts were painted red or silver. (When spray-painting, it is not necessary to completely cover the dried botanical components, it's better to let some of the natural color show through. It gives the pieces more dimension. )

The potentially good news is that the Portland schools are beginning to show signs of waking up. Superintendent Carole Smith, who spent decades running one of the city's better private alternative schools, has indicated that the district will start vetting such schools more stringently for 2011, cutting off contracts to those that don't measure up. She has also said that this fall the district will begin posting data on at-risk freshmen at the traditional high schools who are supposed to be getting extra support and attention under the "academic priority" program. That should make it possible for the public to see how good a job individual schools are doing in helping at-risk freshmen pass their classes and earn sufficient credits to graduate.

How was the Guatemala native killed? And why did his killer leave him in a barn, a few stables away from where I'll Have Another would bask in the glory of winning the Kentucky Derby?
remodel work. They toned down the garish color palette, making twig panels that they hung from the 18-foot ceiling. They also bought scads of the ubiquitous star lights you see all over Mexico and clustered them onto a half-dozen artistic chandeliers.

Hard to believe owner Amalie Roberts can coax such big flavors from such a tiny kitchen. Your closet is bigger. Tender potato gnocchi rest on a bed of asparagus, cheese and pine nuts; or try braised pork with beans and sauteed beet greens.

Yet Gretchen Iliff, the county's park maintenance manager, said that while the tree has been in decline for many years, there were signs of new growth on it this year.

The reunited New Edition roared through versions of old songs from the group's early boy band period ("Mr. Telephone Man," "Popcorn Love," and "Candy Girl," a rewrite of the Jackson 5's "ABC"), harder-edged tracks from the New Jack Swing era ("Crucial" and "You're Not My Kind Of Girl") and hit solo material by each of the singers (Brown's "Roni" and "My Prerogative," Ralph Tresvant's "Sensitivity," Johnny Gill's "My My My," Bell Biv Devoe's "Poison".)

Although Nicholls adapted his own novel for the screen, lost in his translation is the adroitness with which his characters skate from inner thought to outer expression.

"Events like this are designed to give special interest lobbyists access to our elected officials and build up a reservoir of good will that they can call up when they need a favor in the legislature," said Derek Cressman, western states regional director for the Washington D.C.-based government transparency nonprofit Common Cause.

We've just done some really interesting mapping with an expert who breaks down the flavor components of food and wine scientifically. Some things that clearly came out of the analysis: Six Grapes definitely works with chocolate. Twenty-year-old tawny definitely works with crème brulée. And then there were some odd things: Curry powder came out as something that works well with port. I don't think I've ever tried that and I don't think I'm ever going to, but, the fact is, port has weird and wonderful flavors that work with weird and wonderful spices.

One of my best friends back then was (and still is) a master at finding discount deals. If there were a way to save a buck on something you wanted to buy, he'd know where and how to find it. So when he persuasively suggested sharing a big glass jug of root beer cheaply, it sounded like a great plan. We were hooked.

The place was torn down (or maybe fell down on its own) sometime in the 1970s, so if I were to mourn its passing, that should have happened long ago.

The fallout left the Cardinals to contend against the Chicago Cubs' offer, believed to be for four or five years, and two unidentified teams that reportedly had weighed in with 10-year bids worth more than $200 million.

Several rival executives theorized that an interested team might wish to remain anonymous if it would have to move an established first baseman to create space for Pujols. Others thought a so-called mystery team might be introduced to coax the Cardinals into guaranteeing the 10th season to a player who turns 32 before next season.

In correspondence with his senior leaders, Bin Laden lamented the inexperience and poor judgment shown by the rising crop of Al Qaeda leaders. He urged his followers to move out of the tribal areas of Pakistan and to areas that were far from the cameras and missiles of the CIA’s fleet of armed Predator drones, and he said Muslims around the world have “lost their trust” in Al Qaeda, according to U.S. officials who have read the documents.

Rates for "two-party housekeeping accommodations" then started at $10, about $150 less than today.

"One of the highly developed talents of President Barack Obama is the ability to say things that are demonstrably false, and make them sound not only plausible but inspiring," economist Thomas Sowell writes. "On this and on many other issues, you would have to know what the facts are to know that he is lying.

But as a whole, the threat appears diminished, and the majority of those living in the Middle East today have not embraced bin Laden's world outlook.

Really? Here's what New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof (whose politics track Beinart's, but who also visits the places he writes about) had to say on that score in a July 2010 column: "Visiting Gaza persuaded me, to my surprise, that Israel is correct when it denies that there is any full-fledged humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The tunnels have so undermined the Israeli blockade that shops are filled and daily life is considerably easier than when I last visited here two years."
How easily we overlook the math. Money I save today will compound enormously by the time I actually need it, which will be when I retire. We are likely to spend 20 to 30 years in retirement, and as we all know the entitlements system is struggling with rocketing costs.

The first had to do with the headlights, which did not automatically turn on despite being in the "auto" position. The second was the radio.

The casino also agreed to a 1 percent sales tax to cover the center's operating and maintenance costs, Coleman said.

This is the institution that forces us to waste billions on eternally frozen embryos that cannot be destroyed or on the last week of medical vegetables. The only thing more ridiculously anachronistic and more divorced from reality than the American public and its untouchable priests of the Constitution are Swift's intellectuals who spend their life absorbed in solving ethereal problems and have to be gently knocked on the mouth with a special bladder in order to notice that someone is stealing their wives from under their nose. Thus is our country stolen from under our noses.

Hales: You do these things through partnerships with those smart creative people who moved here and started businesses. You do it with partnerships through organizations, and you do it with not a race to the bottom in terms of deeper and deeper subsidies. The state has the subsidy program for film and video, and you certainly want to advocate to keep that. But it's my sense from talking to leaders that we don't have to make Portland the cheapest place to film, we just have to make it a reasonably attractive one from a financial standpoint. Because from a physical and talent standpoint, we're very attractive. So I'm happy about that.
A backyard crop of seasonal fruits and vegetables are reason enough to celebrate with a salad extravaganza. With zero cooking involved, a spring salad bar relies only on the host's own artistry in shopping and styling a table.

Plus you can invite guests to bring and share their homemade salad dressings. A table set in a spring palette, colorful fresh produce and dressings made from scratch lets everyone compose their plates like artists.

More woozy quips from these wry observers of the unrequited side of romance, "Love at the Bottom of the Sea" see-saws between Stephin Merritt's beloved humor and the crucial counterweight of Shirley Simms' and Claudia Gonson's underappreciated, sleepy-Ronettes voices. Merritt's cackle-worthy couplets are usually such gems they've made the accompanying musical dabblings on the last few Magnetic Fields' records (and Merritt's numerous side projects) almost irrelevant. Amid the glitchy digital circus of these tunes, Merritt's lyrics hit the funnybone ("Andrew in Drag," "I'd Go Anywhere With Hugh," "The Machine in Your Hand" that he describes as "a gadget with meat stuck to it") less often than previous outings, but it's refreshing to have Merritt's bored-bass voice more frequently balanced by the female Fields' lighter, winking smirks.

First Face of Eve, Second Face of Eve and Simon Say: This wasn't good for Randy, but he believes whatever Brooke's singing. Paula's at a loss for words. "You must never start and stop." Yes, Paula raved the last time she did it. "This is why I love live TV," Simon says, before calling her on the signs of stress. Brooke claims she forgot the words (for the first time, trying to differentiate between her problems with the key on her first restart) and Simon calls her brave. How many times in seven season have we seen Idol singers restart songs? How many times has Brooke done it this season? What do we make of that, kids?
