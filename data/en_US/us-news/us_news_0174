Initially eschewing racial activism — Brown was hardly a Jackie Robinson-style trailblazer — the musician became a racial lightning rod of sorts. He was accused, Smith compellingly writes, of being an Uncle Tom and a bigotry apologist with "America Is My Home." Then, confounding expectations, Brown turned around a short time later and released "Say It Loud — I'm Black and I'm Proud," a song that was widely read as a black power anthem and set the singer on a more ideological course.
You have no recourse, I told her. The school is not required to test your child or provide extra help if he is profoundly gifted and learns differently from his peers. Getting bored, being unchallenged, becoming disengaged and achieving below potential are expected risks for gifted children. The law requires no safety net for them.

Monday's game, Rodgers said, should be more about earning a trip to Raleigh for the regional semifinals, not reliving or revenging what happened when the two programs last met on the city's RBC Center court.

If the concert had many of the virtues of well-executed athleticism — energy, daring, a sense of risk — it also shared some of the shortcomings of contemporary spectator sports. Often Usher moved so frenetically that it was difficult to access his personality or his emotion. Giant rotating video monitors were spectacular; they were also distracting. All the activity onstage — dancers, musicians, stagehands carrying props — sometimes threatened to tip the show into disorder. Tellingly, the concert’s high point was Usher’s slow read on the aching "Burn," which was one of the few times that the pop singer stood still.
Flushing: In spite of the bongo-banging 99%-ers denouncing the evils of capitalism, something they have never actually seen in their lifetimes, billions are waking up to the empowerment of freedom and capitalism.

China is on a free-market bent, and its people are on the capitalist bandwagon. Ed Konecnik

"As you can see, we got better," forward LaMarcus Aldridge said following the Blazers' runaway 115-86 win at the Rose Garden. "That's what the goal has been and tonight was the first step in the right direction. We just have to keep working at it."
If that sounds like a criticism of Carlisle, the coach suggested that he deserves it. Carlisle has said throughout the series that he is game-planning for Roy as if Roy is still an All-Star-caliber player. But on Saturday, Dallas did not double-team Roy or go a zone defense - something it frequently uses - to counter the Blazers guard's fourth quarter outburst.

He writes: "In this back-and-forth swing of ultra-language to invest a seemingly meaningless activity with urgency, relevance, and even mythology, there is nothing unusual about a player being seen as both great and mediocre simultaneously. The sheer tension of this ambivalence about some players is part of what gives sports their energy and power, their attraction, for fans."
"They bring a lot of energy and the first week of practice was pretty good," he said. "But they still make young guy mistakes."

It's not clear why vaccine storage problems are so common. Federal and state health officials and vaccine makers provide detailed guidelines on how to properly keep the drugs, including clear temperature rules.

Although Brown is wrong about the mandate, her concerns about cost are valid. In their zeal to make sure insurance policies were comprehensive, lawmakers didn't give people enough flexibility to save money by insuring themselves against only the largest risks. Nor have they done enough to rein in the escalating price of medical care. But those are reasons to keep building on the 2010 law, not to repeal it.

A whirring machine about the size and shape of an old hair dryer produced the revitalizing remedy. Such treatments weren't viewed as sexual but as dry, strictly by-the-book medical therapies, an attitude perfectly summed up by the set, the well-appointed home of one Dr. Givings (Jeremiah Wiggins, playing scientific indifference to perfection).
Bonds jumped, with the 10-year Treasury yields falling to near three-month lows below 1.9 percent.
Keller suggests blanching fish bones to remove any trace of spinal-cord blood-"and that," she says, "is after you've rinsed the holy bejeezus out of them." Years ago, as a young chef trying to land a job at Masa's, she learned how perfectionists make fish stock. Showing up for work in her new French chef's jacket, she was shunted off to a small room by the dishwasher with a cleaver and 70 pounds of fish bones. Her task: to split the spines lengthwise and scrape out the bloody contents with a metal brush.

But Greece isn't the only problem. The 17 countries that use the euro -- and nine other European countries -- agreed in March to a fiscal compact that seeks to make countries balance their budgets. But as Europe's economy gets weaker, the public and politicians are growing weary of the budget-cutting that is required to make this fiscal compact work.

Pfirman could probably run for South Williamsport mayor and win in a landslide. It's not a stretch to say she might be the most popular Mountie athlete in school history. Every time Pfirman played at home, it felt like a community celebration with the crowd going wild every time she made a good play. Even in an early-season win at Lewisburg opposing students lined up to receive autographs.
"I wouldn't want to live next to a baseball park," he said.

Thoughts of nightmares and mysterious shapes at the corner of your eye come naturally in considering this batch of stories, which often flirt with horror and the supernatural. In one of the book's most overtly creepy turns, "Patrick Lane, Flabbergasted" finds Chaon constructing what at first seems a fairly typical small-town economic scene around Brandon, a dazed college dropout shuffling around his parents' house after they "made a very difficult decision" and left him behind. Slowly, Chaon ratchets up a feeling of something more sinister with mysterious deaths, forecasts of "dead clouds" on the horizon and a shuttered beauty academy's abandoned hair dryers looking like "dead spacemen": This creeping, hallucinatory dread could easily be in Patrick's head because of "intracerebral myiasis" — maggots on the brain, of course — or it could be an actual descent into some kind of Hell.
"The world has turned a new chapter in history, and I'm so proud," said producer Lawrence Bender, an early and avid supporter of Obama's candidacy.

Voters, including decline-to-state voters, support Gov. Brown, and they know that he's working day and night to continue to fix California. It would help if the GOP would start to pull in the same direction instead of continually throwing up roadblocks.
Author Hyde is also an Academy Award-nominated filmmaker, photographer and entrepreneur who advocates for the environment and philanthropic causes. A few years back, Hyde sought to enhance her green efforts in all aspects of her life.

Shaw, on the other hand, stressed that crayon was a perfect choice for the work. “The artist designed "The Scream" to be a new sort of history painting for the godless age: It's a radically new subject matter for which Munch sought a radically new technique, one with every stroke visible, with no deception, no artifice and total authenticity.”

They split the remaining $12 million among Mike Miller, Udonis Haslem and second-round draft pick Dexter Pittman to reach the $58 million number. Once they did that, they were able to exceed the salary cap to sign players to minimum contracts, which every team can do. That is what Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Juwan Howard, Jamaal Magloire, James Jones (he came back) and Carlos Arroyo did. Then with Anthony's Bird Rights, they exceed the cap to sign him to a five-year, $18 million deal.

But unlike Beldini’s case, where jurors never saw money directly change hands, the jury in Van Pelt’s trial watched a video of the legislator taking an envelope stuffed with cash.
What I've always liked about Thomas Perry is that he respects his readership, and has done so in the nearly 30 years he's been in this business. "The Butcher's Boy" elicits gasps as much for the audacity of his name-shifting hitman, best known by the paterfamilial nickname given to him as a teen, as it does for the level of attention Perry paid to how the "Boy" in question committed his kills. But a protagonist needs a contrapuntal figure who can stand up to him, and in Elizabeth Waring, the young intelligence analyst tasked with mining data points in seeming obscurity, Perry had her. We take strong female characters for granted in this post-Grafton, post-Paretsky, even post-Larsson world, but in 1982, heroines like Waring — great at their jobs, high-spirited yet enigmatic in their personal lives — were rare indeed.

Like a lot of Southern Californians, I've taken Carlsbad in bits and pieces. A stop at the Flower Fields on the way to a Padres game in San Diego. A stroll on the beach while visiting friends in nearby Oceanside. Lunch at the Daily News on a drive down Highway 101.
Visually, the hallway is divided into two distinct "zones" by a graceful barrel-vaulted ceiling that creates a threshold between the front and back entries. There's a traditional painted ceiling in the casual mud room and a slightly lower, cherry-wood paneled arched ceiling over the formal entry. The dining room ceiling got the same treatment.

• Aaron Fentress, The Oregonian: Rose Bowl: Wisconsin Badgers present tough challenge for Oregon Ducks: For the third year in a row, No. 6 Oregon (11-2) will face a dual-threat superstar quarterback in a BCS bowl game. But Wisconsin's Russell Wilson is arguably not the most dangerous player in the Badgers' backfield. He's joined by the equally dangerous running back, Montee Ball, a Heisman Trophy finalist. No. 6 Wisconsin (11-2) is pretty dominant on defense, as well, ranking eighth in the nation in fewest yards allowed (293 per game). It's the best all-around team statistically UO has faced since losing 40-27 to No. 1 LSU in the season opener.
Some sharecroppers became day laborers; others migrated to cities. The federal government built 10 rural villages for the exiles. One was called Cropperville, 10 miles southwest of Poplar Bluff. A stone monument marks the place.

Meo and Becker survived as did Chapman  with a concussion, hearing loss, a compressed back that will give him pain the rest of his life and PTSD that may do the same. He will never forget the leg, the man it belonged to and the fact he was driving and survived.
The reasons for the surge in bipolar diagnoses are complex. Despite advances in neuroscience, the brain, especially the developing brain, is still much of a mystery. More is unknown than known when it comes to effective treatment for children and adolescents with serious mental health problems. But that doesn't stop doctors and parents from desperately wanting to believe there are simple solutions, and what could be simpler than a pill?

I thought it a fine time to take the official Hennessy house tour, which I knew culminated with some samples. Walking around their 18th century stone cellars, I noticed the omnipresent black fungus coating the buildings. I had seen this dark stain on many area farmhouses. Turns out, it's the angels' doing. The spirit of Cognac so infuses the region that the air is saturated with evaporating vapors from tens of thousands of Cognac barrels. This steady alcohol breeze, calculated at 20 million bottles a year, is called the "angel's share."
"The thing is, I do understand the need for scientific data in order to have cancer covered — I really do," he said. "But there are just so much anecdotal evidence of young people who were there getting rare forms of cancer, that has to count for something.

While combined revenue at Detroit's casinos grew 6.3% from 2009 to 2011 (from nearly $1.34 billion to more than $1.42 billion last year), net revenue fell by 0.5% at Greektown, and its market share slipped from 25.8% to 24.8%, Brigade argues in the filings.

As the general election campaign progressed, first Obama and then McCain adjusted their messages to focus more heavily on economic matters. But if Wall Street had collapsed in September 2007 rather than 2008, it's more than reasonable to assume that John Edwards and Mitt Romney would have been their parties' presidential nominees. Both were more reliable and confident advocates of the two conventional brands of economic orthodoxy than Obama and McCain had been, but neither was able to develop the same level of respect from primary voters on foreign policy and national security matters. So both men most likely watched election returns from their homes on Tuesday night.

"Has Germany exorcised Hitler? Perhaps that is up to its people to decide. If it is any indication, Germans certainly feel inclined to continue their cleansing rituals on a regular, precautionary basis. But even if the old demon who died in 1945 has not yet disappeared completely, modern Germans seem to have banished his restless, malevolent ghost to somewhere very, very far away."

-- The Oct. 7 elections in Venezuela. Despite electoral rules written to favor Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and uncontrolled government spending to support his election for a third term in office, which would end in 2019, there is growing discontent with Chavez's chaotic narcissist-Leninist model. Street crime is at record highs, economic growth is one of South America's lowest despite a record oil bonanza in recent years, and a recent ranking by Transparency International placed Venezuela among the world's most corrupt countries. Some polls show that Chavez may lose the 2012 election, but he may win due to a combination of massive government handouts, tighter press censorship and voter intimidation, if not outright fraud.

In the aftermath of a recent shooting in downtown Cleveland, I've been thinking about the thoughts of the late Yale scholar, Letty Russell, who once compared the city to a battered woman: The city is beaten and bruised, isolated, abandoned and then blamed as if she somehow did this to herself.

The offense must be prolific, because it will be expected to carry the pitching staff, particularly early in the season. The Rockies will open the year with a four-man staff. Not one of the pitchers had a winning record last year. Only Jeremy Guthrie, who makes his fourth opening-day start in five years, reached 200 innings. He will be followed by Jamie Moyer, who made his major-league debut two years before home-opening starter Jhoulys Chacin was born.

Chinese made curious by these partial accounts can go online, using circumvention tools to get around government filters to reach oversease sites.

Usually when I leave Dona Tomas, memories of the food don't follow me out the door, where people waited for our seats. But this time, I found myself looking forward to another bowl of the sopa, and the leftover tostada I took home.

That's to our detriment, for, beginning with his first novel, "Flights," in 1983, Shepard has traced his own odd line through contemporary fiction, engaging everything from historical figures to the most outrageous landscapes of the imagination to fuel his work. In "Nosferatu" (1998), he builds a novel around the German Expressionist filmmaker F.W. Murnau; "Project X" (2004) describes a Columbine-like school shooting from the point of view of one of the attackers, a confused eighth-grader who seems as surprised as anyone when the shooters' plan actually takes shape. These are prototypic Shepard characters: adrift, a bit uncertain, with a strangely futile sense of destiny. "At this point," the narrator declares in "The Netherlands Lives With Water," "each of us understands privately that we're operating under the banner of lost control."
Architects and engineers have a project to design. Tradesmen and laborers get something to build. The developer gets a cut, of course, if he makes a profit. And his lawyers bill by the hour whether he makes money or not.

The iconic Oregon company known for its humble beginnings in a tent on Portland's North Vancouver Avenue was swept up in the die-off last year that wiped out retailers large and small. Some returned exclusively online, such as Linens 'n Things and Circuit City, while others like Smith & Hawken became product lines on other stores' shelves. Yet industry experts are hard-pressed to name a retailer resuscitated through reopened stores, rehired employees and restocked shelves, complete with its old lineup of locally made goods.

Buffalo had slogged through just five winning seasons in 20 years when Bill Polian became general manager and hired Marv Levy as coach for the second half of the 1986 season.

That was -- geezer alert -- the Nixon era, which found me living in another city, surrounded by followers of the National Basketball Association who didn't know Mel Daniels from Gerald "Go-Go" Govan. My satisfaction in belonging to a title town would remain as homebound as it was homegrown. The ABA winners would issue challenges to the Celtics and Knicks, but the old money simply outlasted the upstart league and ultimately deigned to absorb four of its teams.
Johnson went deep again in his next at-bat, this one a two-run homer to left center that pushed the lead to 5-0. It was the first career multi-homer game for Johnson and first by an Astro this year.

"There was a time when all of our pay phones produced a little commission, but not anymore," Erickson said.

1. Charlie Wilson's War (2007) Joanne Herring: Not only is this one of the best films of the decade, Roberts' performance as a right-wing Texas socialite and complicated love interest to Tom Hanks adds an excellent charm and grit to the story of a rebel Congressman, whose playboy ways slowly turn to commitment for freedom in Afghanistan and an end to the Cold War.

These days, everyone knows you’re supposed to avoid landing on your heels, and that the safer, more effective way to run is to push off your mid- or forefoot.

And, while many women might have felt embarrassed to give into sexual thoughts, most were comfortable confessing their thoughts about food. While women thought about sex only 10 times a day on average, they thought about food 15 times a day. Maybe instead of starting the latest fad diet on New Year's Day, women can simply revamp their frame of mind. For example, instead of thinking about a slice of chocolate cake when you are bored or frustrated, why not think of an exciting sexual fantasy to brighten up the day?

A: We're in Los Angeles. We spent the last 10 years in New York, and we're finding our footing in L.A.

Mr. Ryan and others of his party claim Mr. Obama is playing politics with the Buffett Rule.
