The Bull & Bush Pub & Brewery is more of a neighborhood hangout. It's modeled after the bar of the same name in London's Hampstead Heath — right down to the warped copper bar and British knickknacks.

The problem facing Carnegie Mellon researchers and U.K. police is one of identification—taking one image and comparing it to a wide set of images, then finding the single correct match. Many tests of facial-recognition software are of verification—whether, given photos of an unidentified person and of someone known, the tools can correctly say whether or not they are the same person. This was the task facing the U.S. government earlier this year when it sought to verify that it had killed Osama bin Laden.

Fister owes a lot to Safeco Field and Franklin Gutierrez, but he did have a 3.71 ERA in 10 road starts this season. For his career, he had a 4.40 ERA in 25 starts away outside of Seattle.

Speaking of the governor and rail, I was impressed with his office's formal response to the legal challenge. Based on Scott's personal history, I just figured anytime he got anywhere near a courtroom, he'd instinctively plead the fifth.

11:40 a.m.: Adams upholds prosecution's objection to a question. Rubin rephrases the question. Marks analyzes Neuman's and Andrea's interactions and the "interpersonal priming, or stoking the fire" of Neuman. "We know that Hemy's hot-button issue is his childhood rejection," she says. Andrea's behavior, "I'm interested in you or I want you but I'm going to stay with my husband, who's not very vested in the children," stoked his behavior, Marks said. "Hemy hears ‘I want you but I must stay with my husband" and that Rusty is doing the same thing to his children that his father did to him. Marks says Andrea's "back in forth, the I want you I don't want you," makes Hemy want her more. It fueled a "twisted attachment" to her, she says. It makes her more attractive to him, like a woman playing hard-to-get. She said the relationship was "very twisted."

“I regard that testimony as hope,” Johnstone said. He said he was concerned about the lack of testimony regarding other buyers of embryos. There was no testimony from other farmers that use helicopters. “I will concede that it might improve the farm,” but the primary purpose of the helistop would be to transport the Johnsons, he said. “That’s not a bad thing but it is not the basis of the application.

The result is neither a year-by-year history of the house nor a comprehensive survey of the presidency with all its political trappings. It is rather an explanation of how the first home reflected developments in domestic design in the world at large, especially among the elite of our society.

Other conservative commentators also have assailed listing the council as a hate group, calling it an affront to protected speech. That is a superficially compelling argument, but it won't withstand scrutiny. It is perfectly possible for a church or an organization associated with a denomination or religious tendency -- as the Family Research Council is with evangelical Protestantism -- to oppose, say, marriage equality as a departure from tradition and traditional notions of civic virtue without defaming gays and lesbians as a group.

øA large part of the film's power lies in the spell cast by Marling as the charismatic Maggie, the leader of a highly secretive cult based in a nondescript house in Southern California.

For a consistent look throughout the interior, Carole used hand-scraped oak in wide planks for a rustic look. She changed all doors to five-panel style and all moldings to flat, painting all of the trim white. She neutralized wall colors when needed, for instance, changing the faux finished terra cotta-colored living room to a soothing tan. Carole collects eclectic furnishings from a variety of sources, including Crate & Barrel, Carol House Furniture and Arhaus. "I went more contemporary with furniture this time." She also mixes dark and light woods for interest. For example, in the dining room she paired six simple dark wood chairs from House of Denmark with a lighter parquet-topped table from Good Works, adding a white leather chair at each end. "I was more 'matchy-matchy' before the renovation."

But this consensus still leaves a lot to be desired.While Messrs. Acemoglu and Robinson are right to reject geography as an explanation for economic development, they are too quick to dismiss culture and mistaken policy ideas as alternative factors driving the rise and fall of nations. It is true, as the authors argue, that "poor countries are poor because those who have power make choices that create poverty." But even if choices over policies and formal rules are guided by purely economic considerations, they are informed by expectations and beliefs of the policy makers, and by the prevailing social norms.

More fundamentally, the presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are going through the process of immigrating legally. Indeed, after years of patchwork fixes and ill-conceived revisions, the legal immigration system is as broken as the borders. Backlogs and bureaucracy means the process can take years. While an applicant waits for approval, he or she is often forbidden from visiting the United States �- which means even husbands and wives may be forced to spend many years apart. High fees and the need for lawyers may exclude worthy applicants. And while we provide students from around the world visas to get engineering and computer science degrees at our top universities, our laws discourage them from using those skills to start a business or power a new industry right here in the United States. Instead of training entrepreneurs to create jobs on our shores, we train our competition.

Party strategists agree that Republicans will gain seats in the Senate, controlled now by Democrats, 59-41, including the two independents who caucus with Democrats.

Simin has beauty on her side, though not always unvarnished truth when she's working her marital stratagems. Nader comes on as a hard case, slow to smile and quick to criticize; only gradually does he reveal warmth and humor, along with a willingness to fudge crucial facts when coming clean might court disaster that he doesn't deserve. The caregiver, Razieh, is a picture of piety—literally so, since she has the face of a Madonna—but the secrets she chooses to keep may destroy lives. The daughter, Termeh, watches and listens while seeking her own truth in what ultimately becomes a chastening story of her coming of age. Razieh's husband, Hodjat, emerges as the film's most frightening presence and yet, at one and the same time, its most compelling figure.

Bailey strives to strike a balance between infusing his menu with unique offerings while at the same time preserving customer favorites. While he loves “to mix it up a bit,” he’s savvy enough to recognize that “people have their favorites” and don’t want to see them dropped from the menu. “As long as they keep coming in, we’ll keep making it,” he said.
Kraft worked with a panel of consumer taste experts from around the world to identify the characteristics of the Oreo — including color, crunchiness, bitterness, color — that were likely to appeal to Chinese tastes. Executives learned through research that the Chinese don't like their treats as big or as sweet as Americans do. So the company rejiggered the recipe to create a cookie that was a tad smaller and a touch less sweet.

Of course, the point of all this was to raise money for SFMOMA's educational programs, which serve students, teachers and families. Watching auction bids rise, education director Dominic Willsdon said he hoped to expand the program. And even during the period when construction necessitates lessened public access, education committee chairwoman Susan Swig envisioned pop-up collaborations with other community institutions. This is the serious business of a gala, and it certainly deserves a respectful nod.

Make no mistake -- I am not arguing for leniency or sympathy. There are no good citizens on death row. These are people who have committed heinous crimes. When a villain murders, he not only ends one life, he irrevocably damages dozens of others. Murder has a ripple effect that consumes all those who loved the victim.

For the purposes of this analysis, both Dempsey and Brek Shea will be considered forwards. Dempsey has proved himself as a striker, as one of the wider forwards in a 4-3-3 and even as a playmaker sitting behind the frontrunners. But he is first and foremost charged with scoring goals, hence his inclusion.
We business owners and employees need to make it clear that we are mad as hell. Don't tell me that I must pay for someone's lifestyle decision (use of "contraceptive pill," sterilization etc). Make no mistake, these drugs and procedures have all to do with lifestyle and nothing to do with health.
Some fans have speculated that Posey continues to be drained by shingles, to which Posey said, "No effect at all. This is just one of those things you go through sometimes. If anything I'm a little too anxious at times swinging at pitches out of the zone and getting myself in a hole. When I'm going good I'm letting that ball travel deeper in the zone."
Why destroy jobs and burden the hardworking families in Baltimore with a plan that is suspect and doesn't fully address the systemic problems with school infrastructure funding? What The Sun and some in City Council refuse to believe is that these jobs matter. This tax threatens a variety of good-paying jobs, including sales representatives, forklift operators, truck drivers, grocery store clerks and warehouse managers.
Nationally, 17 other Planned Parenthood chapters receive Komen grants. In late January, the national Komen foundation announced that it was cutting that funding, because Planned Parenthood also provides birth control and performs abortions.

These are some of the more negative examples I found in a quick Google search -- this and this are examples of toned-down reactions -- but needless to say, Flacco’s national image is taking another hit today. And it’s a shame, too, because the last time we saw Flacco on the football field, he played arguably the most impressive game of his career in Baltimore’s loss in the AFC championship game.

Best game: No. 1 Kentucky vs. No. 4 Indiana, South Region. The first meeting between the teams Bob Knight will not mention by name was arguably the most entertaining regular-season basketball contest all year—Christian Watford drilled a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to send Assembly Hall into absolute pandemonium. That was the game that stamped the Hoosiers’ return to national prominence. And here’s the thing: both teams are much better right now than they were back on Dec. 10. The young Wildcats have grown into their talent, and Anthony Davis has developed into the best player in the nation. For Indiana, freshman Cody Zeller has become a nightmare for opposing coaches and forwards. We can only hope for a repeat of the December drama.

Murder is a vile crime. But not all murders are the same, and we did not mean for all -- or even most -- murderers to be eligible for the death penalty. The law was meant to be employed only when a certain set of aggravating circumstances warranted execution. But over the years, the death penalty has come to be applied more pervasively than we ever intended.

ATCQ broke up in 1998 due, in part, to friction between Phife and frontman Q-Tip. This tension is depicted in the 98-minute documentary, which features footage from the group’s 2008 reunion tour, but the drama didn’t stop there. Q-Tip spoke out against the documentary, and insisted the band members get a producer credit on the film and input in the final edits. Rapaport gave in on the producer credit but not the edits.

Yes, there are three major South Bay piers, and they're all reasonably kid-friendly. But the Manhattan Beach Pier is the one with a little aquarium at the end. The Roundhouse Marine Studies Lab and Aquarium operates inside the eight-sided Roundhouse building (built in 1922, rebuilt in 1991), and it's free (though donations of $5 a family are suggested). It's tiny, but it has just enough to quicken the pulse of a junior oceanographer — sea star touch tanks, eels and fish of various stripes, a leopard shark and more. Less than two blocks away, the Manhattan Beach Creamery (1120 Manhattan Ave.) awaits with ice cream and other sweet treats. And later, when it's time for a proper meal, there's the 11-year-old Rock'n Fish (120 Manhattan Beach Blvd.) restaurant with seafood, steaks and convivial atmosphere. Or there's the Strand House (117 Manhattan Beach Blvd.), a sleek new fine-dining place (the Zislis Group, same owner as Rock'n Fish) that opened across the street in early August. To start, the Strand House was serving only dinner, but staffers say weekend brunches are coming soon.
