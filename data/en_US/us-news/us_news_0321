It's hard to look at Anna Paquin now and remember her as the speechless 11-year-old accepting the supporting actress Oscar for "The Piano." What's less hard to remember this year is what an influence young actors can have in films.

The Supreme Court has invalidated, on average, two laws a year over the last 30 years, each of them duly passed by Congress and each of them deemed out of constitutional bounds. If any of those invalidated laws passed by a thinner margin than Obamacare -- seven votes in the House -- it would be a surprise. And it's guaranteed that none passed with a more partisan tilt, since every single vote for Obamacare came from a Democrat.

Yallop plans to play Englishman Simon Dawkins as a left-side midfielder leaving the biggest question as who will replace Salinas/Chavez on the right.

"For example, a man puts trash outside his house in an open box four or five times each day. So, when a cat or dog passes by, the garbage is scattered everywhere.

As in 1992, it's the economy, with everything else a distant second. The economic numbers explain why Obama's job approval has fallen, why the bin Laden bump disappeared so quickly, and why Mitt Romney is running even with the president. Romney is the candidate least able to carry the ideological attack against Obama -- exhibit A of Obama's hyper-liberalism is Obamacare, and Romney cannot rid himself of the similar plan he gave Massachusetts. But when it comes to being solid on economics, competent in business and highly experienced in governance, Romney is the prohibitive front-runner.

Like so much of “Teenage Dream,” “The One That Got Away” feels like Perry’s attempt to make sense of her unresolved youthful fantasies by indulging in nostalgic misremembering. This is to be expected from an older artist, but it wasn’t so long ago that Perry herself was sitting in a high school classroom.

Juan Pierre led off with a double to right center. Alexei Ramirez tried to bunt him to third, but popped out to catcher Lou Marson. Paul Konerko was intentionally walked to set up the double play, but Perez walked Tyler Flowers to load the bases.

Had either a king or a jack hit, Vedes would have been out, and not the one we're writing about today. But that's poker.

The Israeli government has remained tight-lipped about its precise strategic goals, in part to keep Hamas in the dark and off-balance. But Israel appears to be focusing in northern Gaza on eliminating Hamas rocket launchers to reduce the threat to Israeli border areas and in southern Gaza on destroying tunnel networks that have facilitated the Hamas military buildup.

The menu at Southpark has gone through a lot of iterations over the years, but the bright, brassy big-city feel of the place has endured, the bar is still reliably festive, and the handful of outdoor seats make a prime dining and people-watching spot. Currently, the food is simpler than it's been in some time, which is a good thing, as some previous concepts had overcomplicated things. Straightforward seafood, salads and pastas put the focus on fresh ingredients and simple preparations, and the results -- such as a grilled piece of escolar over an asparagus puree -- can be outstanding.

This isn't a tacky event. I've been to Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May. I've felt the rumble in the grandstand as the horses race past. It's a marvelous experience.

Of course, Missouri (22-2) is playing the role of the big headliner, already up by a half-game over Baylor and Kansas in the more celebrated Big 12 after Monday night's nail-biter at Oklahoma. Mizzou's rather ambitious path is about more than regular-season titles. It's about a shot at a top seed in the conference tournament, a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament and charting a legitimate course to New Orleans for the Final Four and a shot at a national title, too.

Sit down and think about what it is you want your space to do for you."

A fuel tax increase will also severely impact the Port of Baltimore, Maryland's economic engine, which relies greatly on trucks. At a time when the maritime industry is gearing up for unprecedented opportunities with the expansion of the Panama Canal, these actions will dramatically raise the costs of distribution to and from the port, thereby decreasing its attractiveness to shippers. Inevitably, shippers will look to bring their products to ports like Virginia where truckers are not burdened with such massive taxes, tolls and fees.

There are some less-authoritative rankings, such as the annual tabulation "Academic Research and Development Expenditures" from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics. This allows universities to submit figures summed up across all their various campuses. For example, in the National Center's fiscal year 2009 rankings based on total research dollars, the second-ranked "institution" is "University of Michigan-All Campuses." Michigan's funding figure combines the separate campuses in Ann Arbor, Dearborn and Flint. Thus, the University of Maryland could also report only its figures for the entire UM system to the National Center. The resulting fiscal 2009 figure for "University of Maryland-All Campuses" would be around $950 million; this would place Maryland fourth nationally (trailing only Johns Hopkins, University of Michigan-All Campuses, and University of Wisconsin-Madison).

R.C. was born in the Mt. Union section of Alliance, Ohio. His dad was considered a successful farmer in the area and had a keen business sense. By the time R.C. graduated from public high school, one of the most important lessons he had learned from his father was never to ask anybody to do something for him that he was not prepared to do himself. This lesson served him well in the business world as well as in the realm of moral ideas. During his college days at a Methodist school (Mt. Union College), R.C. spent his weekends working as a subscription solicitor for the Alliance Review. This was his first real introduction to newspapering. After teaching school and an assortment of odd jobs, R.C. eventually went to work for his older brother, Frank, who had purchased the Review. He started as a printer's devil at $2 per week.

Spring creep also may be taking a toll on North American caribou herds. Last year, University of Alberta researchers published a study on herd decline. They know pregnant caribou need to eat new leaves when they are the most nutritious. But the leaves are now coming out earlier, and the caribou's migration schedule has not changed, so the herds are arriving after the leaves are past their peak. This may partly explain the declining numbers of caribou.

When I think of the restaurant, I envision myself sitting on its patio at night, with the twinkling lights of the Bay Bridge just over my dinner companion's shoulder. I hear the murmur of conversation from other tables and inhale the scent of garlic rising from my Creole gumbo. It's easy to forget where I am until a meticulously groomed waiter, in tailored black pants and white long-sleeved shirt, approaches to refill my water glass, and I catch a glimpse of a jailhouse tattoo edging out from under his shirt cuff.

We are the only advanced democracy on Earth - the only wealthy nation - that allows such hardships for millions of its people. There are now more than thirty million American citizens who cannot get coverage. In just a two year period, one in every three Americans goes without health care coverage at some point. And every day, 14,000 Americans lose their coverage. In other words, it can happen to anyone.

Scottie Pippen says the Bulls still are the team to beat even without Rose. In an open letter to the team posted Tuesday on the Bulls’ website, Pippen wrote, “You’re still the best team in the NBA until an opponent proves otherwise.” The Hall of Famer also compared the loss of Rose to Michael Jordan’s first retirement and pointed out the 1993-94 team won 55 games.

Eating out while they were evacuated, replacing about $500 worth of food that spoiled and buying a week's worth of clothes for each family member has taken a toll on Pardee's credit cards.
That suggests two things, Silver said. First, a small number of neurons can spark the diaphragm to work again. Second, the spinal cord is somehow able to filter out extraneous signals from all those nonrespiratory nerves, while letting the few important breathing signals through. It's comparable to standing in a noisy room and managing to hear a single conversation above the din.
She prays that the miracle they gave her husband will offer them some peace.

It's not the first time Bauer has found himself embroiled in controversy since taking over the prominent leadership post in 2007. He's been accused of making insensitive statements about homosexuality, and he removed the basilica's artist-in-residence, who planned to create artwork with copies of anti-gay marriage DVDs. Bauer also played a vital role in the reorganization of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, which has left several churches either closed or merged with other parishes.

Romero said the lack of any measurable goals for the program creates the appearance that the Treasury Department is trying to avoid accountability to "Congress and taxpayers who funded TARP." Even though the states deliver the Hardest Hit Fund money, Romero added, "it's not a state program — it's a federal program with Treasury as its overseer."
New York split their eight picks evenly between offense — Hill, running back Terrance Ganaway and guard Robert T.

After a few phone calls among friends and to Caouette's wife, Paula, the devastating news was confirmed Wednesday afternoon: Caouette, 64, was among the victims in Orange County's worst mass slaying.
surprise announcement this week that he will retire after this term leaves his Democratic Party with no incumbent advantage in November 2012, no obvious successor - and, so far, no one rushing to get on the ballot.
Another major check on such an agenda is the council of generals who have run the country since President Hosni Mubarak's ouster in February. The military council, accused by Egypt's protest movement of stalling a transition to civilian and democratic rule, is seeking to limit the powers of the next parliament and maintain close oversight over the drafting of a new constitution.

Branson. My boys love dinosaurs, and we've seen every dino exhibit that's come through St. Louis. This one was bigger and more comprehensive. It had more than 50 dinosaurs, though they did not move.

Case in point: The BMW X1, on display at the New York Auto Show this week, is classed as a subcompact vehicle and will be the smallest luxury brand utility vehicle on the U.S. market. Weighing in at 3,527 pounds and 176.5 inches long—585 pounds lighter and 6.5 inches shorter than the current BMW X3—the X1 will start at $31,545 when it comes to the U.S. in the fall. It is a price well below the brand's 3-series sedans, making the X1 one of the least expensive ways for a young customer to get into luxury brands.
Q: I overhauled my front-yard landscape, and my agaves are not making it. We planted them and they are hooked up to an irrigation system with drippers. We first set it to three times a week for about a month to get established, then reduced it to twice a week. Now it is once a week, but I am not sure whether the yellowing and shriveling are because the agaves are too dry or overwatered. The yellowing plants are on the north side of a west-facing yard that gets morning and evening sun. The agaves turning white are mostly in full sun.

No, she says, he moved out here with his parents nearly 30 years ago, and lived with them until they died. He used to work a little when he was younger, but his money comes from the state these days. He's got some developmental disabilities, but they're not so severe that he can't live on his own.
The thought is that by self-insuring, companies pay for only the health care their employees use, rather than fixed premiums that potentially are more expensive and are certain to rise each year. Self-funding also gives companies some insight and control over their health costs, as they see all claims activity and can to steer certain employees toward wellness programs.
Slattery not only improved throughout the rest of her high school career but emerged as one of the state's best long distance runners ever.

No back was more dazzling in the open field than Detroit's Barry Sanders. None was more tenacious than Chicago's beloved Walter Payton, who amassed more than 16,726 rushing yards against stacked defenses for (mostly) bad Bears teams.

The cancellation of Wednesday's meeting was unusual. After the commission heard public comment on the proposed lease, a Times reporter asked why the agenda had not been posted outside the hearing room three days before the meeting.

He arrived at Damascus International Airport on July 27, according to an email sent by a State Department diplomatic security official involved in the search for Haffar.
If those bets were to go bad, the loss to taxpayers could be immense. That's led some critics to call on the government to ban big commercial banks from trading risky securities -- or shrink them so their collapse wouldn't jeopardize the economy.
Alas, loiterers never pay the bills. Perhaps too many of those thinking sorts scanned the new arrival tables, chatted with friends, then went home and ordered their Booker Prize winners online. Maybe the mah-jongg ladies -- all right, I admit I heard this rumor -- didn't always order meals at the bistro tables they colonized for hours. Maybe when it came time to put money in place of mouths, the makeshift town square, valuable as it was, just wasn't valued enough.
Depp's "Street" was more crime-and-punishment drama, though his brow was slightly arched even then. The reimagined "21" is total comic farce, with Schmidt and Jenko assigned to ferret out the supplier of a new designer drug that is incredibly potent — its crazed effect chronicled by one student YouTube style. Written by the very busy Michael Bacall, the quirky mind who had a hand in the current"Project X" nerd party and co-wrote the inventive"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," "Jump Street" features his peppery sarcasm and his trademark fourth-wall breaking antics with pop-art splashes dropped in as commentary/context for fun.
Repeatedly the Mets were able to get on base against San Francisco starter and two-time Cy Young Award winner, Tim Lincecum (1-2, 8.20 ERA). However, getting runners to cross home plate proved to be a futile endeavor. In total, the Mets lineup stranded 12 runners on the bases and went just 1-for-8 with runners in scoring position.
Galuccio's expertise is in the "upstream" side of the business. Schlumberger handles the entire process of extracting energy for state-owned oil companies around the world, and takes a small percentage of the value of each barrel sold, but doesn't claim the reserves. In other words, it works hard to coax the most oil and gas possible from difficult wells at minimal expense, but leaves the oil's destiny to be determined by its clients, Ellis said.
William Schluter, vice chairman of the State Ethics Commission and a former Republican state senator, said there was a "clear connection between ALEC and the proposed New Jersey legislation." What’s critically missing, he said, is public disclosure about the council’s growing influence.

The results beat analyst expectations. The company also announced it would buy back another $6.1 billion worth of shares in the coming year — on top of the $3.9 billion worth it bought in the last 11 months — a move that should bolster News Corp.'s stock and assuage lingering fears that Murdoch might squander company cash on expensive acquisitions.
Columbus scored six runs in 3 1/3 innings off Durham starter Jeremy Hellickson (11-3, 2.56 ERA), but five were unearned because of a fielding error by first baseman Chris Richard.
Del Borrello said in order to handle the premium deferral in a proactive, fiscally responsible sense, he recommends paying back the hundreds of thousands in savings over the next few years. That way, if the township finds it necessary to come out of the plan, they wouldn’t be stuck with that “sticker shock.” It’s an idea that he’s flexible with, however.

As Margevicius described it, cities' tightening budgets are leaving little room for local water main improvement projects.

The DNR said it added the boars to the Michigan Invasive Species Act in late 2010 because feral hogs that have escaped over the years from hunting ranches have bred and spread, uprooting crops, destroying wildlife habitat and carrying diseases that could spread to the state's pork industry and potentially to humans.
Chanukah, a celebration for all time, is highlighted by the kindling of the Menorah each night of the holiday. “It is a holiday that enriches our lives with the light of tradition,” said Rabbi Eli Kornfeld, director of Chabad of Hunterdon County. “In ancient times our ancestors rededicated the Temple in Jerusalem with the Menorah. Today, we rededicate ourselves to making this world a better and brighter place.” Chanukah also propagates the universal message that ultimately good will prevail over evil, freedom over oppression and light over darkness.

Other boys may have idolized race-car drivers or athletes, but Lachs' hero growing up was his feisty grandfather. Harold Fenster filled an emotional gap that opened wide when Lachs' parents split, and young Mark went to live with his mother.
Much like with the progressive presses, workers thread large rolls of steel onto one end of the machine. The steel is fed through a series of rollers and a pit where it's allowed to drop about two stories before being pulled back through more rollers.

In the know: On Kaua'i, Denise Tjarks has created a cottage industry of sewers trying to keep up with the demand for her handbags of reincarnated fabric and multihued modern totes, which she brings to weekly displays of Hawaiiana in the St. Regis Princeville lobby; her passion is providing new uses for customers' worn treasures. On quiet Lāna'i, Cory Labang makes a steady supply of inexpensive zippered pouches and purses, often lined with contrasting aloha prints, including custom orders. The biggest selection of one-of-a-kind, second-life tropical-print bags — plus dresses, separates and accessories — comes from family-run Mu'umu'u Heaven, founded on O'ahu in 2007.
"We didn't execute very well at all," Bryant said. "We turned the ball over a great deal, took some rushed shots. So it's just about execution in those situations."
"Sometimes you don't want to do anything that gives this guy any more attention," Steinberg told reporters in his office. "The guy has several months left on his term. ...

"Even in the name of research, individuals or groups shouldn't be allowed to pre-empt legal harvest,'' Landwehr said earlier.
