The Taittinger and Mumm wines showed distinct geographic differences, though the house styles were easy to detect. Among Taittinger's generally understated wines, the two best were the 1998 Taittinger Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs, though it revealed few signs of its $150 price tag, and the Domaine Carneros Brut Rosé ($35), which didn't clearly divulge its roots. (My best guess? "French, probably.") Mumm's best showings were its all-Chardonnay NV Mumm de Cramant Champagne ($61), which spoke fluent French with its bready, herbaceous nose, and the NV Mumm Napa Reserve Brut ($26), which offered a Champagne-like minerality.
As its offense tried to find rhythm, MU also was buoyed by punter Trey Barrow, who in his first start averaged 44.7 yards on seven kicks - including a 57-yarder and a 38-yarder that pinned Miami at its 1-yard line in the fourth quarter.

But as John Farrell reminds us in his biography of a titanic American personality, Darrow was no left-wing saint. He was always in need of money and agreed to defend gangsters, bootleggers and crooked politicians for large fees. During his single term in the Illinois state legislature he fought for municipal control of streetcars and other utilities, then turned around and represented two Chicago streetcar companies as a lawyer. Although he was acquitted of bribing jurors during James B. and John J. McNamara's trial for bombing the Los Angeles Times building in 1910, Farrell judges that Darrow was "almost assuredly" guilty — and that wouldn't have been the first time.

Miskell's Evan grows delightfully without losing his beguiling naivete. O'Connor's Jasper is a bundle of nerves and aspirations beneath a static exterior, while Thigpen's becalmed KJ conveys volumes of information in long silent stares.

Thus the Mets rolled the Marlins, who experienced a most-unpleasant three-game set here at Citi Field. Jose Reyes, Miami’s $106 million shortstop, went 1-for-12. Mark Buehrle, the club’s $58 million starter, lost on Wednesday. And Bell, the $27 million closer, blew his third save, lost his third game and appeared helpless during a 46-pitch, four-walk debacle.
Relocating also gives the 7-year-old nonprofit a chance to do more advocacy work, he said.

That’s not just the sentiment from the press box. It’s coming from the head coach. It’s coming from his young players. Rutgers has now won five straight bowl games, the longest streak in the nation, but even a loss on a bigger stage next year would be better than returning to another minor game.

This is the world we live in, or so we keep being reminded — often when we have allowed ourselves to forget, momentarily, the evanescence of the every day. It is all up for grabs all the time, and ahead of us, as Kunzru writes, "lay only a vast emptiness, an absence. There was nothing out there at all." To confront these ideas is like staring into the abyss. Still, there are hints, whispers, not quite promises but (maybe) patterns, suggesting more at work than meets the eye.
Denihan was referring to the crippling funding cuts his agency will absorb in coming weeks. In the budget that Gov.

In the clubhouse after the game, Duda’s surge was still approached with a bit of lighthearted skepticism from teammates, though. His first home run of the afternoon was the first in the new, shorter Citi Field to see the direct benefit of a smaller park.

Confronted with calls for Parks' removal from an unusual coalition of police-reform advocates and the department's rank and file, then-Mayor James K. Hahn chose not to renew Parks' contract in 2002, provoking a firestorm of opposition in black L.A. that contributed to Hahn's ouster in the 2005 mayoral race. Parks, a master of the politics of payback, played his role in Hahn's defeat, running an anti-Hahn campaign in the 2005 primary, then endorsing Hahn's chief rival, Antonio Villaraigosa, in the runoff.

Many of these costs were unnecessary. We chose to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan with a small, all-volunteer force, and we supplemented the military presence with a heavy reliance on civilian contractors. These decisions not only placed enormous strain on the troops but dramatically pushed up costs. Recent congressional investigations have shown that roughly 1 of every 4 dollars spent on wartime contracting was wasted or misspent.

It is on most lists of the top man-made wonders of the world — it boggles the mind to think how workers toted the huge stones that make up the buildings and terraces to the heights, especially because the Incas did not have the wheel.

Milton Inn doesn't seem capable of gaffes, but you might decide, as we did, that there is something intangible that's missing, something that makes a dinner into an evening. Some of this is pacing, which was a beat too fast. We didn't feel rushed, but some more breathing room between courses would be nice.

But for the money involved, you might want the server to take more command of the table.

A molecule derived from two amino acids, L-carnitine occurs naturally in the body, where it's made by the liver and the kidneys. Its job is to carry, or "shuttle," fatty acids into cells, where they're burned for energy. Carnitine deficiencies are rare; most people make enough of the molecule on their own. Carnitine also occurs naturally in a variety of foods, including red meat, tempeh, avocados and asparagus.

The directors of Spielberg's generation who came up in the late '60s and early '70s, many of them film-school-trained, were the first in America to push their encyclopedic passion for movies right into the forefront of their work. Their rebellion against Old Hollywood was essentially a pose, since directors like John Ford, Howard Hawks and Frank Capra were mainstays of their mindscapes. Old movies functioned for these filmmakers as primary experiences -- touchstones of inspiration -- in the same way that poetry or literature might have functioned for an earlier generation of artists.

We're going to pass $1 billion this year. Other companies have found a way to do it. There are all kinds of risks involved, but it's about assessing risk vs. opportunity.

Mitt Romney has a problem. No, not his spotty record as a conservative or his advocacy of a health-care mandate. Not even the fact that he ran a private-investment firm that laid off people. Those are matters he addresses with great fluency, and while his answers may not satisfy many in his own party, they are thoughtfully conceived, the best possible case he can make for himself.
Major health systems already were well on their way to being fully wired, but smaller systems have found the purchases costly, and some have mentioned the expense as an important reason that they sought to merge or affiliate with larger systems -- as ones in Owosso, Petoskey and Marquette have done or are attempting to do.

The books you want to keep on your shelf are the ones that your kids will want to read over and over. But some picture books are particularly good for the experience of one perfect "aha!" moment. A family might not want to spend $16.99 for that one moment, but give that book as a gift to a classroom and multiply that one moment by years and classrooms full of "ahas" — then, it will start to look like a bargain. James Rumford's "Rain School" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: $16.99, ages 3-7) takes place in a village in Chad, where students spend the first weeks of the new school year building their schoolhouse out of mud bricks; only then does the chalkboard come out. Lessons go on until the rainy season comes. The mud wall and mud desks melt away, as the illustrations show the vibrant colors of Africa giving way to the grays of torrential rainfall. But it "doesn't matter," the book concludes, underlining — for a lovely aha! — what is ultimately of value: "The letters have been learned and the knowledge taken away by the children. Come September, school will start over."

After an ugly start to last season — the nearly fatal beating of a Giants fan in the Dodger Stadium parking lot on opening day — the Dodgers earned a lot of respect for their finish. Players bought what manager Don Mattingly was selling, and they finished in third place. The Dodgers have the division's top pitcher (Clayton Kershaw) and top returning player (Matt Kemp). Still, their lineup has arguably four No. 8 hitters. Be warned. This is the year to keep the Dodgers under thumb before they add the likes of Cole Hamels and Josh Hamilton in free agency.

A lawyer for Adams did not return a call seeking comment. But his friends and family defended his reputation. His mother said he never would have jeopardized his dream job. His wife offered stacks of unpaid bills to show they were not living extravagantly. His father-in-law called him "one of the good guys." According to the investigation by state and federal authorities, though, Adams had been using methamphetamine for at least nine months, with a man who became a government informer.

Obama's remarks came as he has been under heavy criticism from the GOP for presiding over a persistently weak economy and high unemployment.

In January 1978, the Somoza regime was seriously weakened when opposition journalist Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, editor of the newspaper La Prensa, was murdered by a hired gunman named Domingo Acevedo and four accomplices. Chamorro's widow, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, blamed the assassination on officials in the former Somoza government, who fled into exile after the dictator was toppled. All five gunmen were later convicted, but Mrs. Chamorro pardoned them after she was elected president in 1990.
Despite often being photographed alone on a field in a way that made him resemble a cross between Ronald Reagan and the Marlboro Man, Stegner was "very liberal," according to his biographer, and marched in anti-Vietnam protests before being turned off by the destructiveness of the New Left.

That's how I was drawn to "Risen 2: Dark Waters," despite never having played the original or knowing little about this sequel. Developer Piranha Bytes had me at "Ahoy matey."

EVANSTON, Ill. -- Ohio State coach Thad Matta showed his team the two-year-old clip Saturday afternoon as a reminder -- John Shurna's 3-pointer with three seconds left that gave Northwestern an upset win over the Buckeyes on Feb. 18, 2009, the last time Ohio State was in Welsh-Ryan Arena.
T-Lish newbies can be easily fooled into ordering too much food. The eight varieties of tacos are $3.95 each, four for $13 and 10 for $31, but at about 4 ounces each, these dwarf your standard taqueria and truck fare. Unless you've got a ridiculous appetite, one snack, two tacos and possibly a side, along with the constant resupply of the freshly made chips from La Palma tortillas and house-made salsa, are more than enough for two to split and feel full.

Perhaps because of the heat, Springsteen starts out with four rousing songs in a row: a taut cover of the Clash’s anthemic “London Calling,” followed by “Badlands,” “Night” and “She the One.” Later highlights, though, come from two moodier, rarely played songs — “Racing In the Street” and “Trapped” — as well as an remarkably buoyant “Johnny 99.”

"The Pentagon has a word for that, too," he went on. "They call it 'bugsplat.' In the opening days of the invasion of Iraq, they ran computer programs, and they called the program the Bugsplat program, estimating how many civilians they would kill with a given bombing raid. On the opening day, the printouts presented to General Tommy Franks indicated that 22 of the projected bombing attacks on Iraq would produce what they defined as heavy bugsplat — that is, more than 30 civilian deaths per raid. Franks said, 'Go ahead. We're doing all 22.'"

I loved Rickey Henderson, loved watching him play, was transfixed by the athleticism and intensity he brought to the game. As I kid I was really tempted to turn him into an idol. He came from Oakland, that crime-ridden underdog of a city where I was born, and there was a tremendous emotional connection between him and his hometown fans. And although he could be cocky, even boastful, he had some great qualities, too, most notably his preternatural level of discipline. In the end, though, the thing to love about him was the way he played baseball; he was fast, smart, joyful, and a thing of beauty as he rounded bases. And that was enough.
Symptoms varied, including headache, vertigo, loss of balance, memory loss and even change in personality. Players lost between zero and 342 days of activity after being injured.

The media no longer cling to the results of the nightly news wars the way they used to. The public's appetite clearly has slackened for a set half-hour of news, at a fixed time early each evening. Viewers now scatter to myriad cable TV and Internet alternatives. Roughly 24 million Americans watch the marquee evening news shows now, compared to more than 40 million who tuned in two decades ago. The remaining viewers, more than one wag has noted, get bombarded with ads for gout treatments, heartburn ills and other products for the older demographic.

It's frustrating to see an almost total lack of top-flight apps for Android tablets. I can't share in the joy that others seem to take in seeing Android gasping for air like this. I think it's almost time for Google to wipe the slate clear, so to speak, and start all over again.

1. The Warriors will tank, but the Lakers have to be careful. With eyes on a possible high lottery pick, the Warriors have lost 17 of their last 22 games since trading away Monta Ellis to Milwaukee for Andrew Bogut. So no need to worry about the standings implications regarding this game. The Lakers will add some cushion to their half-game lead over the Clippers for third place in the Western Conference. With the sidelining of Warriors starters Stephen Curry (right ankle sprain), Bogut (fractured left ankle) and David Lee (strained groin), there's no conceivable way the Lakers can lose this game. Unless they go out of their way and try really really hard to do so just for kicks.

The Ransom Center made its mark by taking the road less traveled; in 1957, when it was founded, that untraveled path led to contemporary 20th century writers. Other more established libraries and museums vied for Gutenberg Bibles, illuminated manuscripts that were hundreds of years old, and original works of the canonical writers of the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1958, the Ransom Center's founder, Harry Huntt Ransom, purchased of the T. Edward Hanley library, rich in literary manuscripts of Samuel Beckett, James Joyce, D. H. Lawrence, George Bernard Shaw and Dylan Thomas, setting the Ransom Center on its collecting path.

Storms were predicted for the area, with these 'thunderheads' beginning to roll into the greater Detroit area at this point. Big John (Boog) Powell had just stepped into the batter's box for Baltimore; Mickey Lolich was hurling for the Tigers.

A: The flowers of melons, cucumbers and squash have male and female flowers on separate plants. If the flowers open and a female flower does not get pollinated, the small undeveloped fruit behind the flower will abort. Lack of pollination can be the result of not having both the male and the female flowers present on the same morning, or if both are present you did not have pollinators working that morning. You can pollinate the female flowers yourself by clipping a male flower from a plant (the flower with a regular stem behind it). Peel the petals from that flower so they are not in the way of your work and gently dab pollen onto your female flowers (the ones that have a bulge at the stem attachment). One male can pollinate four or five female flowers. With pollination, the fruit behind the female flower will further develop into your harvestable fruit.

The chalk spells out dishes of deep roots and deeper flavors. The server urges diners to order appetizers because the entrees are small.

The plant will be able to produce just over a half-million gallons of crude annually, first converting the plastic to gas in four natural gas-fired "reclamation chambers," then condensing the gases into a final product that Ulum says is a high quality crude.

While “Let it Rain” is the most obvious hit on “The Sound of a Million Dreams,” it’s not the best song on the set, or the most effective application of Nail’s narrative skills. “Half Mile Hill” is an examination of small town wanderlust that draws a parallel between a father ditching his family for selfish reasons and a singer abandoning his girlfriend to chase glory. It’s an advanced piece of storytelling, and Nail is up to the task. Even better is “That’s How I’ll Remember You,” a power ballad about a breakup that Nail sells with his earnestness. (Some tasty drum fills help, too.) “Catherine,” the only song on which Nail takes full writing credit, is another winner: a Black Crowes-style dedication to the singer’s wife.

The FDA is pushing manufacturers to design new scanners to minimize radiation exposure for the youngest, smallest patients.

Nicholas J. Cotsonika, Yahoo! Sports: The day the Nashville Predators welcomed back Alexander Radulov, throwing a press conference in his honor, presenting him with his old/new No. 47 sweater, general manager David Poile repeated the line he had been using often. 'We're all in,' Poile said. The Predators were proud to be sitting at the high rollers' table. They were pushing all their chips into the middle, going for the big prize, the Stanley Cup. But the gambling metaphor was apt. When you go all in, that means you're risking everything. Now the Predators are in danger of going bust. It looks like they were dealt a bad hand. Facing a 2-0 deficit in their second-round playoff series with the Phoenix Coyotes, they have suspended Radulov and Andrei Kostitsyn – one of three players Poile added before the trade deadline – for violating team rules."

The tough thing baseball faces is it's such a traditional game. It's in American DNA. But they gotta speed that game up. If you're thinking about baseball long-term, it's too slow of a game.
