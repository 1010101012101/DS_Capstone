In the French drama "Elles," Juliette Binoche plays a multitasking magazine reporter whose mind and marriage are opened wide by a pair of part-time call girls. It's a fine performance in a forthright film, but the notion that a worldly Parisian is so estranged from the erotic universe is hard to swallow.
"We've been steadily, over the last number of years, bringing guys into our situation and been competitive, and they've been young players," general manager Ken Williams said. "We don't promote ourselves well enough on the minor league front, and that's my responsibility.
The Americans had named a pool of 20 finalists in January, but with candidates Chauncey Billups and LaMarcus Aldridge already lost to injuries, they may now be forced to add players just so they have the allowable six alternates.

Say no to anyone who pressures you into having the work done immediately or paying up front. Take a day or so to think about it. Ask two other contractors to come evaluate your problem so you can compare bids. That will clue you in if one estimate is unreasonably low.
Clooney wisely recognized that the triggering action of Willimon's play involving a clandestine meeting wasn't large enough for a big-screen narrative. (Truth be told, the trust-breaking event wasn't substantial enough for the stage either, but in the theater, the piece found momentum through its Machiavellian banter.) The solution to a problematic plot, however, isn't more plot. Clooney and his fellow writers keep adding to the store of incidents in an attempt to magnify Gosling's character's interior journey when they should have reworked the story from scratch. The result is a polished piece of filmmaking that's marred by the unshapliness of its morality tale.

This car might be your worst nightmare. A plug-in hybrid electric luxury sedan that costs more than $100,000, from a California company—Orange County, but still—which has borrowed $169 million from taxpayers as part of the Department of Energy's advanced-vehicle-technology loan program; a car built not in the heartland but the socialist paradise of Finland; a car that, with the arithmetic all in, averages 52 mpg-e (that's the EPA's metric for plug-in hybrid EVs), which means that for all its fancy-dancy lithium-iron-phosphate star drive, it gets about the same fuel economy as a conventional Prius hybrid.
In St. Louis County, about 870 stolen vehicles were reported last year to county police, who cover unincorporated areas and some municipalities. This year, there are 715 reports through November.

Five pastas are equally well executed. Pici ($15), thick, doughy noodles, have a bit of elasticity and enough substance to stand up to a fine dice of pigeon livers balanced with fresh sage and sweet bursts of peas. Wild nettles find a home in many pasta dishes, too; one night the distinctive greens were paired with Gorgonzola dolce latte and lonza, a cured pork loin ($15); another night they were mixed with sunchokes roasted in embers and flavored with bottarga, cured fish roe ($15.50).
Injury update: Safeties Steve Hull (undisclosed) and Supo Sanni (foot), wide receiver Darius Millines (foot) and offensive lineman Corey Lewis (knee) will sit out.
Looking for a meatless entree, I could have ordered the broiled orange roughy ($14.95) with sauteed mixed vegetables. Not being a roughy fan, I picked the crab cakes marinara ($9.95). The two cakes are sauteed until brown and have a light texture and sweetness and little hint of fillers. They were heavily topped with that ubiquitous marinara sauce, which pretty much drowned out the flavor of the delicate crab. Again, a little less would have been better. A generous side of linguine with marinara goes with the crab cakes.

It's the first stop of an American club tour in which Hook and his band the Light will perform "Unknown Pleasures" in its entirety. Hook got the idea after he performed two concerts in the band's native Manchester, England, to mark the 30-year anniversary of the death of Curtis, who hanged himself on May 18, 1980.

Best of all, admission is free. Two exhibits are currently hanging: "Upcycled" features works created from recycled materials and "Honoring My Ancestors" is a collection of words and images. Of course, St. Pete is not a one-horse town when it comes to art. You can spend the entire day in its downtown walking to museums (except maybe the Dali), galleries, shops, pier and restaurants.
The utility is in the midst of checking for records on its pipelines in and around urban areas. PG&E failed to meet a March 15 state deadline to submit a detailed accounting of all its older pipelines that have not undergone high-pressure water testing, the inspection method best-suited for detecting flawed welds.

The wine is best imbibed as a sipper with food that won't bury it.

Two is that Denver is a weather Siberia. Yes, there are snowstorms in March. But it's as likely, if not more likely, to be sunny on Christmas Eve. Denver gets 300 sunny days a year. It's not like playing in a dome half the year, but it's not Buffalo, N.Y., or Foxborough, Mass., either.
Much of the contention was over redrawing District 9, a historically Latino district. Lopez's map split the neighborhoods of Sunnyside, Chaffee Park and Highland into two districts. Herndon's kept those neighborhoods whole.

Harry Parker was vaguely familiar with the term "seismic'' when he moved to San Francisco from Dallas in 1987 to run the city's Fine Arts Museums.

1. The best thing the Rams could do was accumulate as many picks as possible in the first three rounds. And that's even after they picked up three No. 1s and a No. 2 from the Redskins in exchange for moving down four spots in the first round. Why collect premium draft picks? Does that really require an explanation? If this isn't the least talented team in the NFL, it's close. The Rams roster is a disaster area, as one might conclude after noting the team's 15-65 mark since 2007, the worst five-year record in NFL history.

I have liked so many movies in every genre. But when people ask me this question, I always say, "The Grapes of Wrath." If I'm going to pick a favorite movie, I'm going to pick a classic.

This martial, gangland-style of campaigning apparently makes the people in the campaigns feel hardheaded, professional and Machiavellian. But it's not clear that it's actually the best way to win an election. That's because the style is based on a series of dubious assumptions: that the harshest language is the most persuasive to voters; that what feels good to you as a competitive combatant will also look most attractive to detached onlookers; that over the duration of a six-month campaign, daily combat will continue to look compelling rather than cumulatively revolting; that in a campaign dominated by "super PAC" negativity, a presidential candidate is better served by wading into the brawl rather than separating himself from it.

Mary Wescott: I ran for office because I wanted to give back to the community, what you see is what you get, I'm honest in my dealings - I don't lie (it's too hard to try to remember what you've told to whom) so telling the truth is easier. My long range goal is to get a place where the young people can gather - either a pool, or a community center - the kids can hang out a McDonald's or Dairy Queen or the park - but there's nothing to do, you have to drive to go to the movies, we need something in town, even the older people need to have somewhere to meet, to either play cards, have potlucks or just get together.

Voters should be especially watchful and sober-minded as the primary season plays out. What's in a candidate's resume to suggest change? What independent streak or imagination has the White House aspirant shown to deserve the change-agent label? What will likely happen to such pledges should the candidate enter the White House a year from now?

CHICAGO (AP) — Jurors shrugged off Jennifer Hudson's star status and insisted it played no role in their decision to convict her former brother-in-law for slaying the Oscar winner's mother, brother and nephew  a verdict that means the 31-year-old Chicago man will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars.

Though he's barred from accessing Facebook, he is still acutely aware of it, wants it, and can't be the only 24-year-old with such an obsession. He spends part of every day seeing what he can access on YouTube, he is a student of American entertainment and eager to analyze what he sees, as well as his likes and dislikes, a one-man focus group. Oh, and he predicts the Facebook ban will eventually end, within five years he guesses, but he hopes it will come sooner.
As a rule, couture houses are secretive about their clientele. Purchasing a custom-made, five-figure piece of clothing comes with the gift of discretion, a rare commodity in our publicity-crazed world. But executives describe many of their new clients as relatively young working women—doctors, lawyers, executives—who spend their own salaries, often on daywear and not merely for special occasions like weddings and black-tie galas. One of Valentino's recent couture clients, for example, is an equestrian enthusiast who wanted a bespoke jacket to wear with her riding pants.
"Those are the situations you want to be in. You see what you're made of. That feeling is addictive, and I can't wait to get into that kind of environment again."
That's a high-risk strategy, one we hope will be revised in talks with DFL Gov. Mark Dayton that are in progress at this writing. It risks a "lose-lose-lose" outcome, one that concludes with a vetoed tax bill, no bonding or stadium bills, none of the jobs those three measures could bring, and fresh reason for Minnesotans to doubt the governing capacity of their elected leaders.

The case, Chaidez v. United States, is the situation of a legal immigrant who faces deportation because she was involved in an insurance fraud scheme. She arrived in the U.S. in the 1970s from Mexico and became a legal resident in 1977. In 2003 she was charged with mail fraud after being involved in an insurance fraud scheme. The case is based on her claim that her lawyer failed to advise her about the risk of deportation if she pled guilty. The court will consider the case in the term beginning Oct. 1.

Suddes lamented the loss of rebels who he says are being shown the door due to term limits. I would submit that a more likely culprit of legislative ills and fewer rebels is the aggressive actions taken by both the Republican and Democratic parties to handpick candidates and involve themselves in primaries to ensure their guy or gal wins. This practice breeds extreme loyalty to the parties and their leadership, but leaves we the people in the back seat.

A: It makes me laugh when I hear this Def Leppard-sounding record with a guy singing to me about how country he is. I appreciate them wanting to rock as hard as they want, but it's humorous to me that, lyrically, they're screaming about how hot your chick is in your truck.
What's more, Polanski surprisingly gets less than stellar performances from his A-list cast. Reilly and Winslet, both character actors of immense range and depth, somehow fall flat here, while Foster goes so vein-poppingly over-the-top with uptight self-righteousness that it's hard to take her seriously. Only Waltz, playing a corporate attorney with all the moral slipperiness that job implies, inhabits his character in a way that is both convincing and compelling.
The coach must trust his player. Not as deeply as he once did, but far more than eight blasted minutes worth. Roy was right. What was he supposed to do with that kind of time?

"I thought we battled pretty hard and I think we deserved a little bit better than that," Elliott said. "But you've got to work for your chances. We had a lot of stuff from the outside and couldn't really get to the interior of the ice. We know what we need to do - it's just going out there and doing it. It was back-to-back (games) and it was a good team. We have to give them their credit, but next time we play them, we'll definitely be ready."

Construction workers die in accidents on the job — five last year (which the city lauded as a 73 percent improvement over the death toll in 2008). In one incident last November, a building going up in Brighton Beach crumbled, killing one man and injuring several others; the owners had ignored a DOB stop-work order.
Lincoln Center, however, is moving into the 21st century. Most of the original buildings were executed in a compromised "soft" modernism that offended no one. Except the critics, who saw it as a failure of nerve and vision. After one notorious thumbs-down by everyone assigned to cover the opening of the Metropolitan Opera House for the New York Times (myself included), a plaintive inquiry came down from the publisher: "Couldn't any of you have liked anything?"

That should have strengthened Obama's hand when negotiating with Republicans, Van Hollen said.

He demonstrated his stellar skills at the NFL combine, giving teams a better look at what they can expect to see for years to come. Despite his large frame, Kalil ran the 40-yard dash in 4.99 seconds, which ranked second among offensive linemen. His speed and agility allow him to shift up and down the line quickly and pick up defenders in both the running and passing games. Kalil has a quick first step off the snap, allowing him to get into position immediately to either pick up the blitz or control his man on a run. That quickness combined with his size makes him difficult to beat and even more difficult to get away from once he's in control.

I suppose you could say that about all of his plays. But it does seem that globally, economically, there's a lot of questioning going on about how we function.

The promise of the screen version, set in an Oregon town where everyone knows everyone else's business, is a celebration of love in many forms, enlivened by the celebrants' foibles. What passes for the movie's reality is interlocking episodes of ersatz ecstasy and angst -- a Cupid-governed "Crash" -- plus snippets of wisdom dispensed by Mr. Freeman's character, who serves as the town's coffee-shop philosopher. At one point he tells a love-struck friend, "I think I'd proceed with caution." I'd proceed just as cautiously to the movie.
Weatherbeaten: Winslow Homer and Maine: Prouts Neck, Maine, may not spring to mind as a destination for fine art. For one American master, though, this small town by the sea served as the inspirational backdrop for many of his masterpieces. On Sept. 25, the Portland Museum of Art will welcome visitors to the Winslow Homer Studio, where the artist lived and painted from 1883 until his death in 1910. The museum purchased the studio (located 12 miles southeast of Portland) from Homer's great grand-nephew in 2006 and has since restored it to better reflect the time period of Homer's residency. Over 30 oil and watercolor paintings created during the artist's Prouts Neck period will be showcased in Weatherbeaten: Winslow Homer and Maine to commemorate the opening. The show runs Sept. 22 to Dec. 30 at the new Winslow Homer Studio in Prouts Neck, Maine.
But the Buffett rule — which would mandate that anyone making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent — is fiscal reform stuffed with empty calories. It may taste good to Americans with a populist bent, but it contains little nutrition, and could induce unhealthy side effects, too.
Observers agree that the 64-year-old Karadzic's absence from Courtroom One at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal should not overshadow the case's significance. Karadzic's trial is seen as a chance for the tribunal to make amends for Milosevic's ill-fated trial, which dragged on for four years before his fatal heart attack.
Yet Fayyad is undaunted. He is wholly focused on creating "facts on the ground" that have the "transformative power" to convince his own people, and the world, that Palestinian statehood is possible. (He opposes any unilateral declaration of statehood as meaningless.)

Even though you have every right to appear on your tenants' doorstep, it might prove unproductive and not resolve the problem of the unpaid gas bills. You also should write them a letter stating if they don't contact you within a week to resolve the issue or pay the outstanding gas bills, you will be forced to evict them. Writing the letter might give you the results you need, because you are giving them a deadline by which they need to either pay or dispute the gas bills.

I appreciate that the wine list is built around the seafood with whites such as Metaireau's Muscadet Sur Lie, or Assyrtiko from Domaine Sigalas in Santorini. But the list seems awfully small for the subject. There are so many more wines that would be brilliant matches for the menu. I love, though, that the list includes "Boston," a Madeira from the Rare Wine Co.'s historic series.

James "Buck" Duke, a tobacco magnate who founded Duke University, purchased 40 farms near the Raritan River to fulfill his dream of a pastoral estate near New York City. He hired Frederick Olmsted's civil engineer, James Greenleaf, to design what was one of the earliest and most prominent examples of lagoon landscaping, with interconnecting canals and lakes providing the estate's water. Two million trees and shrubs were planted, and 35 fountains modeled after those Mr. Duke saw in Europe were installed.
At the time, PDC officials faced growing pressure to find money for cost overruns on the tram project. With the real estate market on an unprecedented upswing, though, PDC had money. So, the city in 2006 revised its 2003 contract. The city, developers and OHSU all committed to boosting their share of public works projects. The tram was funded and built. The park and streetcar were funded and built, even though both projects -- priorities for developers -- had been scheduled to come after the first low-income apartments.

2005 Querciabella Mongrana Maremma Toscana ($18) Half Sangiovese, with the rest comprising Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, produced by one of the best names in Chianti Classico from its new property in the Maremma near the southern Tuscan coast. A bit rustic at first, with some lingering barnyard hints, but a bit of time - better yet, a brief decanting while you peek under the Christmas tree - smooths it out. Dusty, ribboned cherry, gripping berry and plum , plus licorice and balsam highlights, emerge from the earthy base. Drying tannins give it gusto.

The contraction in Spain's economy is dimming hopes that the government will be able to cut its budget deficit as predicted and raises the specter that the country might be locked into a downward financial spiral.

Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, who had been facing the first significant challenge in years to his seat representing an area outside of Houston, reportedly told allies in the House on Monday night that he would step aside so another Republican could pursue the seat. DeLay, under indictment in Texas in connection with a campaign finance plan and tied to the Abramoff lobbying case, has become the poster boy for ethical scandals surrounding the GOP. Former Democratic Rep. Nick Lampson is running for the seat. Lampson represented more than 20 percent of the district's voters under the old borders that DeLay helped redraw with an unusual mid-decade redistricting, which cost Lampson his seat.

Healthier snacking: Natural products manufacturers want a piece of the grazing market. In place of the traditional NFL Sunday snacks of soda and cheese nachos, they are proffering more exotic flavored waters and chips. Some of our favorite beverages: mint-flavored water by Metromint and Blackwater — yes, it's pitch black and tastes, well, like black water — from Vancouver, Canada-based Blackwater Innovations Corp. The water's infused with fulvic acid, a supposed health-enhancer. (So clearly the miracle-supplement market isn't stone cold dead.)

That led to a series of protracted legal battles and settlements periodically over the next 20 years.

Let's wrap up the other business. At the end of last week's episode, Vinny Guadagnino hooked up with his boss Danny's date. Danny didn't seem to care all that much. Vinny's extended family also shows up and treats the house to some delicious ziti and cold cuts, then Mama Guadagnino cleans the refrigerator. Vinny flirts with The Situation's sister Melissa over the phone, but when she shows up, he thinks she looks too much like The Situation and is turned off. But at the club later (where JWoww is wearing her formal panties again) they seem to hit it off. And The Situation shares with us his holy grail: Gym. Tanning. Laundry. GTL, people. GTL.

Mussels, steamed all over town, are here flecked with rounds of chorizo. The sausage itself provides texture and imprints each mingled mouthful, and also produces a broth at the bottom of the bowl that attracts bread magnetically. A sizable, juicy rib-eye steak, in a deep red wine-peppercorn sauce, has a mouth-filling meatiness and could feed at least two.

Poe was born in Boston in 1809, but left the city at a young age, after his father deserted the family and his mother died in 1811, Kaltenbach notes. Other cities, including Richmond, Philadelphia and New York, have museums dedicated to the author. Of course, Baltimore has as big a claim as anyone -- he lived on the westside as a young man, and died here.

Fast forward to May of 2009.
It was about 1951 when my mother saw an article in a women's magazine with a recipe for pizza, something she had never seen or heard of. She decided to try it for her family. She drove around our small Pennsylvania town and found only one store that sold mozzarella cheese and something called pepperoni. She started making her fresh dough early in the day and kneaded, sliced, grated, chopped and mixed throughout the day to create this new treat. When it was finally out of the oven, we three kids -- ages 14, 10 and 7 --said, "EEEW! What's that? I'm not eating that!" Although I don't remember her reaction, I bet she could have killed us. I only remember our reaction to something so new. She says she doesn't remember that day, but I'm not so sure. However, it did not discourage her from trying new recipes for the next 50 years. --Donna M. Ernst, Cleveland

For example, some have suggested that that the public option go into effect only in those markets where insurance companies are not providing affordable policies. Others propose a co-op or another non-profit entity to administer the plan. These are all constructive ideas worth exploring. But I will not back down on the basic principle that if Americans can't find affordable coverage, we will provide you with a choice. And I will make sure that no government bureaucrat or insurance company bureaucrat gets between you and the care that you need.

Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, asked whether he was too moderate to galvanize Republican voters, responded with unusually strong language as he attacked the lack of trust in Wall Street and the dysfunctional government in Washington.
Few mainline congregations have a robust ministry to college students, and I believe that is too bad. My daughter told me a story of dropping by a Presbyterian Church (USA) congregation one Sunday. Though the church is within walking distance of the school she attends, there were no students in the service. No one welcomed her, and no one spoke to her. The pastor sent a preprinted postcard to our home the following week, and that was the last she heard from them.
The expiring contract simply does not have the appeal it did even two seasons ago, when the Cavaliers dangled the one belonging to Zydrunas Ilgauskas in front of the Washington Wizards in the deal that brought Jamison to Cleveland.
Use store-bought or restaurant pizza dough that's ready to roll out and bake, which will cut out the hardest part of homemade pizza. The key is getting the oven hot enough to cook the flatbread quickly while keeping the outside crisp and the inside a little chewy. I like to bake it with just olive oil, a sprinkling of coarse salt, and, of course, that trusty green garlic.
The makeover will include restoring the store's exterior to re-capture its original grandeur and to fully capitalize on foot traffic along the famous shopping corridor. Windows along Broadway, 34th Street and Seventh Avenue -- which have been covered up over the years -- will be reopened. Windows on the upper floors also will be uncovered to allow more natural light into the building. Sidewalks will be replaced, with Macy's branded paved "welcome mats' added at every entrance.

A council member would forfeit the post if three consecutive meetings are missed without being excused by a council vote. And any council member would be able to place motions, resolutions and ordinances on the council agenda, by a written request.
J Mello describes himself as a rapper, but he sings straight through "Torture," a guitar-pop song about his girlfriend's serial cheating. Get set for a narrative as linear as a bullet train, and where it's heading is nowhere you'd want to be: unable to quit a lover who keeps messing around with your buddies. Give J Mello credit for emotional honesty, and hope that names have been changed to protect the (not so) innocent.
Chris Griesedieck and Zach Schopp all won for Westminster. Lillenberg won the clinching match as he defeated Jake Lee 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5) at No. 2 singles. Lillenberg was behind 5-2 in the tie-breaker before scoring the final five points.

The National Practitioner Data Bank maintains confidential records that state medical boards, hospitals and insurance plans use in granting licenses or staff privileges to doctors.
The sheriff deserves praise for endorsing a sensible plan that will close an aging and notoriously violent jail and free up bed space for more serious defendants awaiting trial.

One day, we went nowhere until we boarded the St. Charles trolley (which went nowhere faster), riding past the Audubon Park and Tulane and the ubiquitous Mardi Gras beads hanging from the power lines, stepping off in Carrollton, home of Jacques-Imo's restaurant and the Maple Leaf Bar.

Gomer Pyle might have been about as competent an equity strategist as he was a marine. While the knee-jerk reaction to a positive earnings surprise is often, well, positive, gains can be fleeting. The reason is that companies and the analysts who cover them typically set the bar low enough that a "beat" has to be substantial, and not marred by unpleasant news about the outlook, to really have an impact.
Mussadi was 4 for 5 to lead the bat attack and went the distance in the circle to lead Westmont to a thrilling 4-3 win over Leigh in nine innings last week. The win pushed her season pitching record to 4-2 and helped the Warriors improve to 8-0 in the Mt. Hamilton Division.
