There, we heard a cannon boom at the Bastion, a fur-trade-era fort. At the Nanaimo Museum, we were fascinated and spooked by a re-creation of a 19th-century coal mine and its list of the infinitely various horrible accidents that killed hundreds of miners. At the Nanaimo Art Museum, I admired the seascapes of painter E.J. Hughes (1913-2007) while my friends sorted through those bright, beautiful, inexpensive murals, painted on banners that had festooned downtown the summer before.

“If the state is subsidizing this, are we actually getting a return on our investment or not?” said Van Horn, who oversaw the authority as state policy director. “The argument is always, ‘We’re different and we need to do these things to be successful,’ but if you’re not successful then you’re accountable to the Legislature and governor.”

Matthew Del Carlo, a Republican businessman, brings an energy and plainspoken style, with a well-articulated fiscal conservatism, that would play well in less solidly Democratic terrain.

From Honolulu to Paris and from Vancouver, Canada, to the Florida Keys, honeybees have taken up residence on hotel ledges, rooftops and balconies and are busy doing what they do best: pollinating plants and making honey.
Bigger gains in hiring and wage gains are needed to sustain household purchases, which increased in the first quarter at the fastest pace in more than a year. Joblessness exceeding 8% for more than three years helps explain why Federal Reserve policy makers are sticking to a plan that holds borrowing costs low through late 2014 to spur growth.

I cut into the center of one of the crisp, cornmeal-cloaked three planks of catfish ($10.99) and discovered a patch of uncooked meat. Our server immediately apologized and whisked the plastic basket away. He returned later with a fresh basket of properly cooked fish that had a mild-clean flavor and deleted the basket's cost from our bill. That's good training and good business. (I'd wager the uncooked part of the fish survived the deep-fryer swim because the fillet may have still been frozen in the thickest sections.)

After sitting out a year with a knee injury, Greg Oden was a promising rookie. Brandon Roy was an All-Star, with LaMarcus Aldridge as the team's third pillar.

The Blues failed to register a shot on goal during the man-advantage, and in fact the only attempt came in the final seconds as Oshie shot high and hit the glass.
For those who cover Tribune and edit those stories, recognizing and dealing with potential conflicts is a daily exercise. In some cases, it means that reporters do not attend "town hall" staff meetings. That way, they avoid hearing internal Tribune Co. information meant only for employees. In other cases, it means making the appropriate editing accommodations. For example, if we quote Tribune Editor Gerould Kern, he would not see that story before publication.
So lawmakers held off while the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative tested two redemption centers, the one in Wood Village and another in Oregon City. The cooperative figured the centers would take in about as many containers as the contributing stores did. They wound up getting more

-- If you don't have expensive prepayments that are nonrefundable or carry a big cancellation penalty, you probably don't need TCI, so buying it is probably a waste of money. As long as you can get your money back, you don't need to insure it -- especially since any insurer will demand you get all available refunds before they pay anything.
"Everything that we’ve been spending to try to build up, to reach parity with other districts, its going to be lost," he said. "I think (the governor) should have said these numbers are going to result in people losing their jobs. That’s exactly what’s going to happen statewide."

It is the first time in years that the number of eligible voters has been close to the number of city residents of voting age -- 523,000 in the last U.S. Census count.

For families staying west of Waikiki in the Ko Olina resort — including Disney's new Aulani resort, opening in August — take a break from the artificially sculpted beaches to walk around the lagoons at the JW Marriott Ihilani, which affords great views of manta rays, hammerhead sharks and tropical fish. You can also pick up the shoreline trail where the paved path ends to explore the natural coves of Ko Olina, home to turtles, scuttling crabs and tidepool creatures. (A paved walk a mile in the opposite direction leads to the Ko Olina Marina, where you have a free view of the ship used in Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean.")

All payouts for specific performances in a game, including interceptions or causing fumbles, are against NFL rules. The NFL warns teams against such practices before each season, although in the aftermath of the revelations about the Saints, current and former players from various teams talked about that sort of thing happening frequently - just not on the same scale as was found in New Orleans.
"At a time when states are struggling, $400 billion is very critical to providing the services that people want whether its for senior services, public health or police and fire," Locke said during an interview.

He finds out there was a Prohibition-era bootlegging tunnel between the bank he didn't rob and a neighboring theater staging "Cherry Orchard." Henry recruits his former cell-mate (James Caan) for help – and they insinuate themselves into the Chekhov production in surprising ways as they try to re-open the tunnel and rob the bank vault from underneath. Henry also meets cute with the play's very actressy star (Vera Farmiga) when she smacks him with her car.

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Clubhouse confidential: Right fielder Shin-Soo Choo will not pick up a bat until at least Tuesday because of a strained left oblique.
Look at Obamacare. Obamacare -- if you get to 50 employees, all of a sudden you get hit with huge tax burdens. There's companies right now -- I know, I've talked to them -- trying to figure out how they can get under 50 employees so they're not gonna have to comply with Obamacare. Why would we do this? But that's what we're doing to the small business. Don't grow -- you're gonna get nailed. And even if you're gonna sit there and we're gonna tell you how to manage your business, that creates a huge disadvantage for the entrepreneur to be able to be successful. We will repeal all of that and change Washington from a place that focuses on compliance and working with businesses -- believing them not to be evil, not to be out to do nefarious things trying to make profits -- but that actually believe that in their own community, in their own state, they too believe in clean air, clean water, and that we can trust states and localities and not have the federal government micromanage what dust farmers put in the air. That, in fact, we can trust ordinary Americans and people at the state and local level to provide for themselves and a good and healthy community more than Washington can.

The mutual fund giant Vanguard is the pioneer in index fund investing for individual investors and it remains a flagship for low-cost, broad-based index funds. I also like comparable products at TIAA-Cref and Fidelity. (Full disclosure: I own index funds at all three companies.) I believe broad-based equity, bond, and other major indexes should form the core of a long-term portfolio, adjusting for age and financial capacity for taking risk.

There are two ways the menu deals with the conundrum of vegan cuisine. The first is by ignoring it. The whole artichoke appetizer is deliciously grilled and accented with a sprightly lemon-herb sauce and a more mellow roasted red pepper puree. And there's a white bean salad with creamy Great Northerns and sweet tomato bits, nestled in a slightly bitter radicchio and romaine lettuce mix. Or the frito misto, assorted fresh vegetable slices, tempura-battered and fried to a delectable crunch.

The department didn't have money to replace them, but last spring, a resident donated money to restart the K-9 program. The donor, a Sherwood man, wished to remain anonymous, so the department last year would only say that he provided at least $9,600, Azi's purchase price.

Chef Philippe Lievre fondly recalls his childhood kick-abouts in France — with a soccer ball constructed of newspapers and duct tape.

Styling and features aside, another element of the Verano's handicap is that the cars it's targeting have gobs more luxury street cred. The competitive Lexus is one of the cheapest cars that company makes; buy one and you have the same brand of car as the guy in the full-size, $113,000 Lexus LS Hybrid. Although it may seem silly on its face, this kind of brand equity matters.
How could these women be missing for so long and nobody knew?

With all the insecticides, pesticides andfertilizers it takes to grow corn to make ethanol, the millions of gallons of diesel fuel used to plant, harvest and transport the product, let alone the natural gas used in the process, there is no way ethanol should be promoted as a green energy source.
The Institute is in the business of developing the complete actor, externally as well as internally. Still, an ongoing critique of Strasberg's pedagogy holds that it's designed more for the magnifying emotional scrutiny of the close-up than the stage. Implicit is the idea that Strasberg wasn't just to a certain extent neglectful of the voice, body and intellect but that he was also somewhat star-struck by the glitzier media. Others, however, appreciate the prescient flexibility of his training, the way it encourages regular commuting between live and mechanical mediums. Evangeline Morphos, a professor in the Film Division at Columbia University’s School of the Arts who edited Strasberg's book “A Dream of Passion: The Development of the Method,” points out that that Strasberg's Method has ultimately made American theater, film and television "more character centric."

At first the film puts us in the intentionally discomfiting position of voyeurs, watching two of the women vie for Legba's affections -- Mr. Cantet is too tactful to dwell on the physical details -- and listening to them as they speak, directly to the camera, of their sexual yearnings. Charlotte Rampling is alternately touching and frightening as Ellen, a professor of French at Wellesley. Brenda, a troubled divorcée from Georgia, is played by Karen Young, whose mercurial performance made me think of Geraldine Page in Tennessee Williams dramas that, in fact, share a certain amount of territory with this one.
It was the largest fourth-quarter playoff comeback in franchise history for the Blazers, who became the third team in the shot clock era to win a playoff game when trailing by at least 18 points in the fourth quarter. And most of the credit goes to Roy, who, as Marcus Camby put it, "pretty much single-handedly won the ballgame for us in the fourth quarter."

Their findings: Lots of time spent in household chores at the end of the day keep both husbands’ and wives’ cortisol levels high—no surprise here. But on closer inspection, the researchers observed that a married mother's cortisol levels will decline most steeply at the end of the day when her husband pitches in with the housework. Unfortunately, a working man's end-of-day cortisol levels won't likely dip to recovery levels unless he spends more of his end-of-the-day time relaxing and his female partner spends less time relaxing.

The outer layer of rib meat was a little chewy but loaded with chile flavors and a hint of pepper heat. Closer to the bone, the veal was tender and succulent. A fine dish on its own, the surprise came when I tasted a well-browned cauliflower floret, with its meaty texture and almost baconlike flavor.

The final critique is that the extension of unemployment insurance benefits is part of a set of stimulus programs that "have not worked." Of course, when a treatment is applied and the patient is not cured, we may have either the medicine wrong or the dose. In fact, the administration's stimulus programs created 3.3 million jobs, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO has also found that because unemployment insurance puts money in the hands of those most likely to spend it; for each dollar put into the extensions, economic activity increases by $1.90. The medicine was effective, it just was not strong enough — and stopping the treatment altogether, when the unemployment rate is still 8.6 percent, makes little sense.

When we reached Malacca the taxi deposited me at the Hotel Puri on Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock, also known as Heeren Street for the Dutch settlers who lined it with snug, gabled row houses, and then Millionaires Row when it became the envied abode of rich Strait-born Chinese — progeny of Chinese immigrants to the region — who decorated the façades with lanterns and traditional see-through tile windows. Made up of several conjoined residences, the Puri has modern air-conditioned rooms above a courtyard restaurant, a heliconia garden and a fish pond. Endearing little swifts squeaked from cool, dark cubbyholes around the rafters where they built nests made of their saliva, a Chinese soup delicacy commercially produced in abandoned houses around town.

Just as poinsettias fade after the Christmas season because of neglect or improper care, Easter lilies can quickly become lackluster if ignored. Keeping that from happening to your plant begins before you even bring it home, says Perrin Verzi, manager of the Rockefeller Park Greenhouse, where the Annual Spring Bulb Flower Show is running until Monday, April 30.

When I entered the Four Queens later that evening, blinded by the black, red, blue and yellow paisley carpeting and the garish, dust-covered train-station chandeliers, it was still a bit of a hunt. But there, in the back row of tables, up against the wall and with a view of a service closet, with no special signs or markings, lurking with a placid, unassuming Zen-like simplicity, was the coveted object of my search. For two hours, I held down the third-base seat, winning a modest but steady amount. A little bit amazed that while the other shakedown tables were packed, I was often the only player at this table. And extremely self-satisfied that I was playing at the very best blackjack table in all of Vegas.

A: Except risking his future. Either he is ready to return or not. For the Knicks, what should matter most is Lin's future and making sure they're not risking it with the knee. If anything, the two-day break between Monday's Game 2 and Thursday's Game 3 would allow them to get a truer read. But with Iman Shumpert out and Baron Davis' back acting up, the Knicks are running out of options. Mike Bibby can't possibly be the answer, although Toney Douglas should be back for Game 2 from his flu. If Lin has anything, he would be an upgrade.

"What the real world is: that is a very difficult problem," a character known as Leader explains in the exact center of the novel. "What it is, is a metaphysical proposition. But this is the real world, there is no doubt about that. The pain one feels in this world is real pain. Deaths caused in this world are real deaths. Blood shed in this world is real blood. This is no imitation world, no imaginary world, no metaphysical world. I guarantee you that."

As Wright himself said during that fateful interview, "That's what I'm struggling for."
The race will be held over the Hudson River between the old rail terminal and Ellis Island. Pilots will race between a series of inflatable air gates consisting of two cones. The cones are made of a fabric, which is inflated to stand 65 feet tall and 32 to 45 feet apart, a tight fit for planes with 24-foot wing spans. If a plane touches a cone, the fabric rips and the cone collapses immediately. If a cone rips during a race, a team can replace it within three minutes.

The largest component of benefits is retirement income. Throughout a person's working life, the Social Security Administration keeps track of income and taxpayers fund the program via payroll taxes, also known as FICA taxes.

The GOP candidate will try to ignore Bush at any cost. But it is very likely the worm will turn in the coming national debates. Just as past successful candidates have been able to remind the electorate of the real source of trouble, so too should Obama eventually fire away at Bush as the main culprit of the American turndown and at Romney as a stand-in for Bush in this same tradition.

If you're having trouble with your boyfriend or girlfriend, you can talk to Harris. He's there to dole out advice on how to manage your money, or what to do when you get homesick. He can talk you through fights with your parents, or frustrations with playing time. James says he plays "messenger to the man in charge" when athletes are too scared to do it themselves. More times than he cares to remember, Harris has had the unfortunate task of guiding an athlete through the death of a family member or close friend. Too many times, he's had to deliver the news himself.

If ever this proposal was a serious effort at finding something palatable to both parties, it has quickly exited that territory and is now a political marker designed to show the contrast between Republicans and Democrats. That's to be expected as we approach an election year, but it does leave unresolved an economic situation that could quickly go from bad to worse. All this is happening at the same time that Federal Reserve Chairman Benjamin Bernanke is warning that the U.S. economic recovery (such as it is) is "close to faltering" and that there is little more that he can accomplish through monetary policy. The onus to do more to prevent a slide back into recession falls on the White House and Congress, he told a joint committee of Congress.

The state has yet to approve the original on-demand, or "open access" idea, citing federal rules that require, for example, a lengthy examination of anyone getting methadone, a Schedule 2 narcotic. The incentive, $20 supplied by a private foundation or other group yet to be named, is a "Plan B," one Williams believes doesn't need any special approvals because the program would be run as a traditional clinic, just at night with no appointments.
It remains to be seen whether the 49ers will be able to sell all their tickets at dizzying prices.

A: My thing is, you should be able to paint a piece of furniture in one day: You paint, wax and treat, and get it back into a room in one day. ... With that whole thing, who wants to take off hardware? One, it's difficult and usually never goes back on the right way. But also, a lot of the pieces I refinish are reproductions.

Chenin Blanc is a retro wine in California. It was a major part of our parents' wine cellars but has been in decline for 25 years, so much so that it's back on the radar for the oenophile who wants a white wine outside the most popular varietals. The 2005 Dry Creek Vineyards Clarksburg Dry Chenin Blanc ($11.50), is one of the best in California; it's racy, with tropical flavors of pineapple and passion fruit.

But any new owner would have to deal with General Growth's massive debts. The company racked up $27 billion in debt by the time it sought shelter from creditors last April, making it the largest real estate bankruptcy case in U.S. history.
The repertoire of plays called always appears better when their maneuvers are working, but Coach Paul did seem to have a certain amount of "go for broke" in his sideline masterminding. He mixed up plays, switched kickoff men during the game, replacing Bobby Franklin with Lou Groza, and for a while had Vince Costello over the middle on defense, Walter Michaels at the right side.

Cleveland Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich, who is of Irish and Croatian extraction, attended the event at Boehner's invitation.
A Portland classic that began as a food cart and went on to international renown. Andy Ricker has emerged as a James Beard Award-winning chef, but his heart and mind remain happily embedded in some nondescript Northern Thai pub -- thus the inspiration for the varied hot-sour-salty-sweet shared plates, grilled delights and from-scratch curries and noodle soups that constitute the novelty-filled menu. You will wait for a table, you won't find your Thai comfort foods, and the service can be a bit, shall we say, audience-unaware. But (or should that be "because"?) there's nothing like Pok Pok -- it is superb.
"Not only myself, but the entire IG Metall negotiating committee, is completely fed up," Hartmut Meine, the lead negotiator for the IG Metall labor union, said in a statement after a meeting with the automaker in Salzgitter, Germany.

Much of the talk in Mexico on Monday was not the attacks, but the bizarre opening of the event. Pieces of paper randomly assigning the speaking order of the debate were handed to candidates by a former nude model in a skintight white evening gown with a dramatic cutout decolletage. The Federal Election Commission, which organized the debate, said an independent producer had hired the model, and acknowledged that her costume choice was a mistake.

The flavors were right on, even though the seafood was a bit translucent and undercooked.
The base option presented at the City Council meeting Tuesday night would move City Hall to the West End Building, as well as accommodate the parks and recreation services currently provided there. A new police, municipal court and emergency communications system would be built on the property in a seismically safe building separate from the main building. The improvements would cost an estimated $19.4 million.

Wellford disagreed with the civil liberties group's conclusions, saying he believed the department is trying in good faith to comply.

There's a three-year statute of limitations for felony hazing but such cases require proof of great bodily harm. There was no evidence of such injuries in the early 2010 case.
Hey, Jonathan: My point on taking Jones was that the franchise owed it to itself to support its young quarterback with an elite wide receiver -- if he were available. Jones qualified. As for free agency, I agree I have changed on that, too. I believe the Browns are so far from their rivals that they have to use every means available to improve the team. They are never going to catch Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati by simply thinking they can outdraft them. They don't need more quantity in free agency. They need more quality. Their record since 1999 in signing offensive playmakers is abysmal.

For McDonald's, the limited-time offer also lets the company adapt more easily to evolving consumer tastes that are leaning more toward fresh, seasonal ingredients. Since McDonald's operates on such a vast scale — it has 14,000 restaurants nationwide — sourcing the fruits for offerings such as the new the Cherry Berry Chiller can be difficult.
The club's willingness to forgo Mr. Einhorn's offer may be a sign of renewed confidence within the organization over its finances. Last year, the Mets borrowed $25 million from Major League Baseball to cover expenses.

I would like to commend the Pacifica City Council for having the courage to not recommend putting the 1/2 cent sales tax on the June ballot. Although the city clearly has serious financial issues to resolve, it is the responsibility of the council to investigate and understand the risks and benefits of all reasonable solutions prior to choosing a plan of attack. With regards to law enforcement services, the council has not yet done its diligence by investigating the potential cost savings and the true advantages and disadvantages of having the County Sheriff provide these services in place of the Pacifica Police. I realize this a politically sensitive topic for many Pacificans, but if we are to ensure we are charting the best course for our city long-term, we need to make sure we know what our options are and evaluate them in an objective fashion. Scare tactics regarding gangs and lawlessness seem unfounded based on the last six-and-a-half years that I have lived here. We should use real data to drive our decision making. What have other cities experienced after having made the switch? Did they really save money? Did their crime rates go up? Was the quality of the service diminished? Right now we don't know the answers to any of these questions, and until we do, we would be at serious risk of making a bad decision. With regards to the 1/2 sales tax, what if the voters don't approve it? Pacificans are unlikely to approve a tax increase without a compelling rationale. How can the council build such a rationale if they have not first investigated all their options? Such as outsourcing the police?

A widescreen television is cleverly installed on a burnt orange floating wall panel. That gives the screen an unobtrusive place in the room and allows the stairway to be open instead of behind a wall. The homeowners opened the staircases in several areas of the home, contracting with artist, furniture designer and fabricator Jason Radcliffe of Cleveland to create contemporary cable railings. A handy closet stores entertainment media, except for the copies of "Mad Men" on the shelf.
But one of the most important decisions is one of the first to make - location. Shortly after we opened Sprout, we decided that we would continue to grow as a company. But where?

"They're very prepared, and they've got a great offensive system with their spread pick and roll attack, which is very difficult to neutralize," he said. "Our guys are really dialed in and focusing on how to guard that, but it's still a big challenge and we've got a lot of work to do."
The Local Government Fund may have started as 40 percent of the state sales tax in 1935, but over the years the pots of money flowing into the current $640 million annual fund have been diversified.

Recall in James Cameron's 1997 film, "Titanic," the fictionalized Thomas Andrews character claims to have wanted to install extra lifeboats but "it was thought by some that the deck would look too cluttered."

The main impression is a very polished palate — malty sweetness quickly dried out by the hops (there are a lot of hops here, but the effect is not challengingly bitter). The very long finish is of sweetness constantly being undermined by hops and a teasing bitterness tickling the tongue.

Having apparently decided that his talents are best suited to comedies with a fantastical twist, Adam Sandler goes the full family-film route with "Bedtime Stories," in which he plays a frustrated handyman who discovers that the stories he tells to his niece and nephew every night are coming true the next day. The handyman tries to skew the stories to his personal advantage, but problems ensue, necessitating much over-the-top CGI effects and clumsy slapstick. And where there's slapstick, there are bound to be outtakes, which feature prominently on the DVD and Blu-ray (along with a handful of deleted scenes and making-of featurettes). Both are available today.

They just want the poo-cha-cha — so give it up! Go out and buy a sexy piece of lingerie. Have the store wrap it up, bring it to dinner and voila! That’s his present. But only give it to him when (or if) he gives you something. When he opens his gift, say, “I thought we could take dessert home with us.”
We are running out of rock stars. What once seemed like an unlimited resource has dwindled to culturally dangerous levels. We always figured we could make more, because we always had.

The restaurant is fashioned from monochromatic patches of black and white. It's stark but not sterile, an approachable, contemporary style that somehow seems instantly familiar. That in part explains Kentro's egalitarian dining room, where gun-toting detectives dissect the details of a case as students review last week's lecture notes and couples share glasses of beer and wine while commuters sip steaming shots of coffee.

The ad features shots of Detroit and auto assembly lines as a narrator says, "When a million jobs were on the line every Republican candidate turned their back."

For many, the season certainly looked promising when the IronBirds won the season opener at home on June 17.

The worry for American and Canadian visitors -- if any -- is the possibility that the European countries will be unable to reach the deals necessary to "save" the euro. I've seen very little about what might happen if the deals fail, other than economies and securities markets on both sides of the Atlantic (as well as the Pacific) are likely to face "chaos." Learned journals are full of such terms as "collapse," "destruction," and even "civil war," with precious few details. As for any U.S. and Canadian visitors who might get caught in a "crisis," I'm pretty sure you could get out reasonably intact -- physically and economically -- but your plans could easily be derailed. For now all I can suggest is that you keep your eye on the economic news and be ready with some sort of Plan B for your vacation if the worst happens.
Even so, he rattled off some Olympic Club history Wednesday in Charlotte. McIlroy knew Lee Janzen (1998) and Scott Simpson (1987) won the previous two Opens at Olympic, and he knew Nathaniel Crosby took the U.S. Amateur there in 1981.
Page, one of Google's co-founders, made analysts even happier by sticking around for the company's hour-long conference call with analysts. That was a contrast to a cursory appearance he made at Google's first-quarter call three months ago, which had fed perceptions that Page considered investor relations to be a waste of his time.
Amid all the analysis after Barack Obama's announcement of supporting gay marriage, many comments have tried to place traditional marriage into the realm of religion. But marriage is not based on religion; it is based on biology.

Donna Smith started running her urban agriculture business, Your Backyard Farmer, from her Milwaukie backyard when she moved to Milwaukie in February from southeast Portland. She lives in a small pink house that, when you pull up to it, seems little more than that. But if you walk past the modest front yard, you are confronted with a back that just keeps going. She started several demonstration gardens and cleared a space for classes. In the midst of building her own space, she planted "Naomi's garden," a couple of rows of berries and vegetables Naomi can visit whenever she wants. The flowers are doing well in their pots, Smith said, but the berries will take some work.

Publishers' relationships with Amazon, which released the Kindle in 2007, have been strained by the company's insistence on charging $9.99 for some best-selling titles.
In his review, Star-Ledger film critic Stephen Whitty said that for this update of the Joan Crawford 1945 noir, HBO stripped the new version from the shadows and "returns it to what it was meant to be -- a serious, wrenching story of a mother who loves too much and the men she misunderstands and the adored daughter who so consistently lets her down."
On New Year's Eve 2009, Johnson, then 14, told police that his father, Leonard Johnson Sr., had tried to strangle him during an argument. Reports say police tried to arrest Johnson Sr. at his job, "which was to no avail."

Ronald Manzo, one of the dozens of public officials and political operatives charged in New Jersey's largest federal corruption sting, was sentenced to three years probation and fined $30,000 for passing a $10,000 bribe from a federal informant to former Secaucus mayor Dennis Elwell.
His answer (and it applies to far more fields than science) is total transparency with the help of the Internet. The more light you shine, the less crime primates commit. Once everybody can see who's reviewing whose papers and grant applications, then not only will spite decline, but so will nepotism and reciprocity. Anonymity alters the cost-benefit balance in favor of competition; transparency alters it in favor of cooperation.
five years and he signed a list of about 20 conditions, which included not posting on any websites used by those younger than 18. He also was not to access the Internet from any cellphone or use a computer without approval from his probation officer.
"We grew up listening to jazz, and the Jazziacs, yeah, we were doing our little thing, trying to play straight-ahead jazz. Just young guys trying to swing," Bell recalled. "It evolved because after that, we got involved with an organization called the Soul Town Revue. We'd do these Motown songs, backing up singers locally in Jersey City. We had to learn these big hits in the '60s - the Temptations, Smokey Robinson, the Supremes, also James Brown. We started to create that sound that became the Kool & the Gang sound, a mix of jazz and R&B. The horn section was key. That took us into the '70s."

Diners will also pay a lot for the optional wine pairings, which adds another $110 to the bill. At some high-end restaurants I've been disappointed with the pairing efforts. However, at Benu, a big part of the experience is not only the artistry of Lee but also the sheer genius of wine director Yoon Ha. His pairings are masterful; I can't think of anyone who does it better.
It's Westfeldt's first spin as a director. As a writer, she's quite fond of vagina jokes. Sex talk in general drives the film's tone. And although it runs a bit stodgy-stagy at times, and not all of the characters are fully drawn, "Friends With Kids" still offers plenty of winning moments, a charming cast and a nice 21st-century rebooting of what it means to be in love and create a "family."
Hundreds of e-mails have been received by Gilbert Public Schools, mostly in support of the principal's decision. Many have said the principal is being "attacked" by negative comments and that students and parents are embarrassed by the negative attention.

Well, M's parents reacted very strongly and differently than K and I suspected. They suggested an abortion and I was shocked. I'd never heard of a late-term abortion and I resisted. K was less resistant, more supportive and helpful, and the threesome began to drift.
Child advocates in the Kansas City area first pushed to strengthen Missouri's Safe Haven Law in 2009 after a 25-year-old woman in nearby Overland Park, Kan., delivered her child alone and hid the baby girl in an unused refrigerator in her parents' basement, where the baby died.

We asked around and as it turns out, string cheese affection (er, addiction?) is common in the early years of childhood. And the later years. And, fine, into adulthood. Which may explain why there are roughly 734 brands in your grocer's dairy case. Here, we tackle four.
The markets will not have it any other way, and they have France in a corner. In order to cover the interest on its existing debt plus this year's budget deficit, France must borrow almost one-fifth of its entire gross domestic product this year, and the same again next year. Most of that enormous sum must be borrowed from foreign lenders, so Hollande cannot afford to frighten them by radically changing the austerity policy he inherits from Sarkozy.
But a yearning for the region that flourished under the Ottoman Empire runs throughout, a hymn for a world and a time not without tumult but far more civil, gracious and ordered than the blood-dimmed chaos of the present-day Middle East.
The traps are reusable — as long as they don’t get wet — and disposable. For a more permanent version, he thinks corrugated plastic might work and is wondering about multiple-layer traps. In his single-layer versions, bugs also nestled between the trap and the siding on his home; he brushed them into the trash, too.
With the flood of cash came new, tighter strings. Eligible schools—identified through a complex, multi-tiered process—are among what the Education Department often describes as a state's bottom 5 percent academically. Schools taking the money have to adopt one of four controversial improvement models. In some cases, at least half of a school's teaching staff must be replaced. A school might be converted into a charter school—or even shut down. And no matter which option is chosen, a school's principal must be removed, unless that person has been on the job for under three years.
"He makes a couple of plays, and you know that's just the igniter. And once that got ignited, he made a ton of plays. We know it's there, and now we've got to get it from him."

A: Georgia doesn’t require voters to register their party affiliation with the state, Matt Carrothers, spokesman for Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, told Q&A on the News. “In a primary, anybody can vote for any candidate they choose,” he said. Carrothers said when Georgia voters arrive to vote, they mark a box on the voting certificate to select which ballot they would like to receive. “You go in, mark a box on the sheet, and you’re done,” he said. He added that if someone votes for one party in a primary, and there’s a runoff in the other party, that person can’t vote in the runoff.
"If you can do something against 90 percent of the people, the job is to get good enough to do it against 100 percent," Foster said. "So you have to work on that 10 percent that's out there waiting for you. I think some of our players have experience that this year."

Payne, the first black congressman elected to represent New Jersey, served the 10th Congressional District for 23 years, before falling ill.
Right now we’re missing a few teachers and we need more space. I’d get new books and hire more teachers — a lot of schools right now are short on teachers. I think the donation is great; we need it. The school system can’t really provide, so it’s a big help because there’s a lot of things we need and we don’t have the funds.

No Catholic ever had been elected to the White House, and the young Massachusetts senator chose a Protestant audience deep in the Bible Belt -- the Greater Houston Ministerial Association -- as the venue at which to address the so-called religious issue. This is the heart of the case he put to the association and the nation:
“One really special quality about the Ritz it fees like family,” he said.
Certainly, you're not going to walk him with a runner on in the first inning, even if he was leading the league with 10 home runs at the time. And you're probably not going to walk him with a runner on and two outs in the third with Adrian Beltre (.319) batting behind him. By the time he came up in the seventh, the Orioles were trailing by four runs, so walking him would have put the fifth run in scoring position. And, anyway, at that point it simply became an opportunity for Buck Showalter to get a look at newly promoted left-hander Zach Phillips in a tough situation.
A Cook County judge today granted a media request to release an emotional 911 recording in which Jennifer Hudson's sister begged dispatchers for help after she found her mother shot dead inside the family's South Side home.
