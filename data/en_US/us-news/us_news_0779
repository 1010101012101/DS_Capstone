The upper-tier protection that would be given to 1.2 million acres of Colorado's roadless forests includes even fewer exceptions. Roads, oil and gas drilling rigs, power lines or pipelines couldn't be built unless a forest official determines they are needed to fulfill pre-existing treaties or rights, or for health and safety reasons, Vilsack said.

"I'm lucky to have known her for almost 40 years," David Buzzo said. "When I leave here today, I'll leave a better person."
The result can be clearly heard in their music. Indie rock, long a bastion of disaffected straight white men, has morphed into a place where hipster dudes of all stripes line up to hear Grizzly Bear's Ed Droste or Deerhunter's Bradford Cox sing about their boyfriends. Successful women such as Melissa Etheridge, k.d. lang and the Indigo Girls have become iconic lesbians, and more experimental folks such as the sisters of CocoRosie prefer to twist gender expectations.
According to police reports and other city and state records, police entered the Stage on Sept. 20 and found that a stripper pole and stage were added to a "back hall" area of the nightclub and more than 30 strippers -- some of whom traveled from Pennsylvania -- were competing for a $5,000 prize.

I believe Oregon can get back to the big stage again. But not before coming together as a team, and working harder on the offensive line to fix glaring chemistry issues, and not without Thomas making opposing defenses respect him.
The first statement contained the amount agreed to in his modification: $5,267. But it included mysterious "fees due" of $3,555, his attorney said. The second statement, dated Dec. 19, sought a payment of $5,797. It had an inflated monthly escrow amount.

I've read Mary Schmich's columns for years and admired her clear writing and insights. But none was as beautiful as her story of her sister Gina. I read it three times and it brought tears to my eyes each time.
The appeal of legalization is clear. At a stroke, it would wipe out most problems of the black market by depriving gun-wielding thugs of their competitive advantage. But for it to work, it would have to include not just the possession of drugs but their production as well—and not just of marijuana but of substances that really are very dangerous: cocaine, crack, heroin and methamphetamine.

Second, chip makers help persuade stores to carry PCs with their processors inside, and pay the retailers to help promote the machines. In the case before the EU, regulators said Intel paid Germany's biggest electronics retailer to stock only Intel-based computers at its MediaMarkt superstores -- even in Dresden, where many AMD chips are made.
Small, potted mint, rosemary, lavender and basil are all good choices, and their scents complement any menu. Most can be found shaped into tiny topiaries. Purchase them in plastic sixpacks from any garden center, and re-pot them in mini terra cotta pots. Tuck sphagnum moss around the edges and top to cover. Keep bases in water until the event since small pots dry out quickly. As a finishing touch, use raffia and tie a copper or zinc plant tag onto the stem as a place card.
But it's a big one, and like most everything else these days, it has to do with the beleaguered state budget.

The gymnasiums of two shelters for immigrant children in Harlingen also have been used as temporary housing, state records show.
Felton has shown us some brilliant flashes of speed, vision and determination, but he has always been a below average shooter for a guard. Crawford has always been a streak shooter. And while Aldridge has proven to be worthy of a go-to guy, he has yet to show the determination and steeliness that closes games. And Wallace has always been like a soda: a burst when opened, followed by some fizz, but eventually, it goes flat.
Sen. Nancy Spence, Centennial: "I already voted for Scott McInnis. I recognize and acknow ledge some of the mistakes he's made, but even considering those mistakes I think he is the strongest candidate Colorado has.
“It’s a little more relaxed. We’re really well-organized as far as the system. Whenever a guy makes a mistake we talk about him. There is nothing hidden. You’re not getting brought into the office. It’s wide open and constructive. That makes it a lot different than maybe before, when everything was a little more private.
Wines at Au Cheval are chosen because they taste good, but also because, for example, the stony, mineral-rich, honeyed Assyrtiko/Aithiri blend from Domaine Sigalas is the result of an impossibly creative viticulture (the handpicked grapes for the wine grow on vines that are pruned to stay low to the ground to avoid becoming the victim of their growing environment ­- an inhospitable wind-whipped volcanic cliff).
When I hear that, I wonder: Would we really want a world without such people? Or without biologists with underdeveloped social skills who can focus obsessively on a particular breed of newt? Or without certain brilliant software engineers who might not make great dinner party guests? (The ultimate irony is that the kind of person who has the obsessive focus to isolate the combination of factors that cause autism might just have a touch of it himself.)
Ted Mondale, Dayton's stadium point man, said the structure of the deal needs to be more like that of the Metrodome, creating a state "rec room" that would be publicly owned and controlled.
The mix of WWII style and flashy modern eye candy is no surprise coming from director Joe Johnston. The former effects guy directed the retro cult fave “The Rocketeer”; he’s also helmed modern big-ticket movies such as “Jumanji.” He’s comfortable in both worlds.

Hurd, 36, interviewed survivors and crew members, including Robert Hichens, who was on the bridge when the Titanic struck ice. Hurd's wife, a church soloist, conducted additional interviews and assisted with his story, which he wrote in longhand on any paper they could find. The result was the first full account of the disaster, splashed across the pages of the World and the Post-Dispatch, both owned by the Pulitzer family (the first Joseph Pulitzer had died the year before).
If the City Council gives the measure final approval, the homeless-camping ban would take effect at the end of the month. And experts say many of the more than 5,000 homeless men and women in Denver will head for friendlier grounds. The South Platte River will be the likely conduit, a favorite amenity for the homeless because of its intricate web of trails, water supply and cover, making for prime camp spots.
Sarah Kelly helps the 6-year-old with a baby-tooth-gapped smile read the line.
The usual presumption is that people know what's good for them, and that they're better off if you allow them to spend their money on whatever they personally value the most. While that may be the right perspective for most purchases, I don't think it's a good way to think about lottery tickets. For many people, gambling may be just another form of entertainment. But for others it is a very destructive compulsion. And although you could argue that we need the tax revenue, the burden of this tax falls disproportionately on lower-income households. I do not think the quality of life in California has improved with the increased prevalence of gambling.
"I'd be lying if I didn't attribute the economy as a factor in the closing, but there are several other reasons," says Goldberg. "Mostly, I didn't wish to re-invent Carlyle. I toyed with the idea of a new chef and a different concept, but that was something that my customer base would not embrace. Ultimately, though, the fact that my lease was up in February, and weighing the prospect of another long-term commitment helped sway my decision. Truth be told, I'm ready for a new adventure."

Still, this year they did win 20 games, they gave two-time defending champion South Carolina all it could handle in three games last month, and they came within one swing of the bat of playing for another NCAA bid.
With the defeat, the Mets (11-9) now must consider what to do with the final spot in their rotation. Mike Pelfrey will fly to Florida on Monday to meet with orthopedic surgeon James Andrews, who is expected to perform season-ending Tommy John surgery.

Apart from vague names, in the mountains or along the seashore, such as China Camp, Chinese Camp or China Cove, the Chinese garnered few acknowledgments in local histories. Both the Chinese and white participants wished to obscure the fight: the Chinese to avoid further persecution by immigration officials, and the whites to cover up murder, lynching and arson. Chinatowns in the Monterey Bay region have been burned down, but their stories await favorable moments for the seeds of history to erupt from incinerated cones.
Dan Tierney, a spokesman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, said Tuesday that old data were loaded onto the site. He said the office was re-importing information from the correct files and so it should have current information by today.

The Parkway South senior was seeded third in the shot put in the first day of competition during the Henle Holmes Invitational at Parkway Central. His qualifying toss of 51 feet, 8 inches wasn't nearly as far as Ladue rival Mike Horton-Lofton, who entered with the top throw of 54-2.
10. Heaven's Gate (1980) James Averill: Director Michael Cimino's self-indulgence made this the standard for over-budget bombs until "Ishtar" came along. Too bad, for this story of a love triangle and range war in 1890s Montana is a solid film. Watchable, in its 150-minute version.
The authorities said the various rings carrying out the scheme operated largely independent of each other, and were uncovered through the commission’s internal audits as well as through confidential informants, tipsters and investigations by the Attorney General’s Office and the State Police.
What it really means: There is a paved wide spot up ahead where you can stop to look at a map, retrieve a fresh bottle of water out of the cooler, or get out of the way of that 20-foot-high tomato truck that's been riding your bumper. Just don't expect restrooms, picnic tables or pay phones. This is not a U.S.-style rest stop, but what we know as a turnout.

Environmentalists have long been lobbying for an increase in the bottle deposit. A nickel in 1971, when the bill was first passed, is worth 28 cents today. They say it would help increase redemption rates which have sagged. Naturally, distributors aren't too excited about tacking the extra costs onto their products.
"I-ELCAP started with a group of physicians from Cornell University Medical Center (now Weill Medical College of Cornell University) in 1991," Dr. Luedke explains.

In the late 1990s, as Adelson was building his Venetian resort, he funded a blitzkrieg of ads in hopes of restocking the Clark County Commission with Republicans. (For the most part, he failed.) While his gambling rivals cut generous deals with the local casino workers union, Adelson refused. He offered lucrative wages and benefits to quash organizing drives, and his resorts remain among the few Strip properties without a labor pact.

Turning point: “My first cousin was the late comedian Chris Farley and, like him, I have had long-term issues with weight,” she says. “No single event or embarrassing photo caused me to change my life.

2. She has the best quotes and I find myself thinking of them almost every time I cook. Two of my favorites are "Always remember: If you're alone in the kitchen and you drop the lamb, you can always just pick it up. Who's going to know?" and "You should never apologize at the table. People will think, 'Yes, it's really not so good.'"

Most are avoided but one connects pretty well and sends Evans' chin back. Jones lands a flying knee and an elbow that appears to stun Evans. They exchange punches from close distance. Evans shoots for a takedown with less than a minute left but Jones blocks it with no difficulty. Close round, a lot more like the first than the second. 10-9 Jones.
Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper landed at Denver International Airport late Wednesday and said he would visit the fire crews in Jefferson County today.

Clunky scale models will inspire eye-rolling, but there is history here. A seat from Ford Theater. A chunk of sandstone from the original construction. Scads of historic photos.

It would not be costly to change the program, evidenced by the fact of how well it works for the WIC program.

Mondale, chairman of the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission that runs the Metrodome, points out that at this time of the year, the Dome is being used 18 hours a day.

"I'm looking for an internship or a part-time job," she said while waiting for a career counselor to review her resume. "I guess I'm hopeful."
Went to see a very fine documentary called "Wagner's Dream" the other night. It's about the making of the new "Ring" cycle at the Metropolitan Opera, and specifically about the designing and building of Robert Lepage's heroic new set - and what a fabulous monster that is. Anyway, this is not a column about that.
The key to viewing: darkness. Light pollution washes out faint meteors, so observers in urban backyards may see just a dozen or so an hour.

Breitbart defended the legitimacy of the site's reporting and said he hoped Weiner would apologize for "being complicit in a blame-the-messenger strategy" for saying his account was hacked. He also claimed to have another "X-rated" image of the congressman that he would not release.
At night, there were lectures, kids' movies, indigenous dancers and a magnificently athletic fire-dance performance. The fish slide show, given by a dive master known simply as "Bisch," identified the parade of extravagant fish to be seen during the dives. I felt most satisfied being able to later spot the rare pea puffer, the size of its namesake.
The charges stem from the triple killings that occurred near Mount Vernon School on Aug. 4, 2007. Iofemi Hightower, Dashon Harvey and Terrance Aeriel were set upon and shot, execution-style. Terrance’s sister, Natasha, now 22, was also shot but survived.

Because we believe that organizing a knock-down, drag-out fight over right-to-work legislation is pretty far down the list of things Michigan needs to do to reinvigorate its economy, we're inclined to believe Gov. Rick Snyder when he says he's eager to avoid such a confrontation.

"This law, with its restrictions to early voting, vote by mail and other provisions, clearly targets our seniors, college students and minorities, as well as the disabled and other vulnerable populations," Democratic Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, who supported the petition drive, said Friday via email. "It deserves to be repealed."
The case for increased, efficient public transportation can also reduce congestion and, according to the American Public Transportation Association, public transportation annually saves 4.2 billion gallons of gasoline and reduces our nation's carbon emissions by 37 million metric tones. So how is that for a triple threat — reduces traffic, saves energy, improves the environment. The term "thinking outside the box" is overused nowadays, but perhaps the state should apply that to alternate methods to improve our transportation systems.
Writing about men's clothing has to be different from writing about women's clothing. It shouldn't be just about getting rid of an old wardrobe and buying new things. Fashion writing should be tied to something beyond itself, rather than just fashion for fashion's sake.
That strength, physical and mental, they have carried with them — after a childhood of roller coasters and bungee-jumping, parasailing and motorcycles. But they’re not so strong that they can’t, or won’t, lean on each other. They are linked by guilt and sorrow, by second-guesses and what-ifs, but also by the sibling contract that they’ll never ride a motorcycle again.
As a result, they hire us to find the conference rooms for depositions. We find the interpreters, if needed. We can do depositions for the hearing impaired.
But General Growth wasn't saying no, either.
Two other Orange County cities ranked among the 10 fastest-growing cities under 300,000 by numeric population change. Huntington Beach (No. 6) grew by 2,169 to a total population of 192,524, while Fullerton (No. 9) grew to 137,481, according to estimates. By percentage, Fullerton was tied with nine other cities for the 35th-fastest growth at 1.5 percent. Huntington Beach tied 22 other cities for the 74th-fastest growth at 1.1 percent.
In town, sales agents hawk tours from behind small counters in the plaza and zocalo (town square). Prices range from 60 to 75 pesos -- generally between $5 and $7 -- and although the size of the distillery might range from big to small, the process of turning agave into tequila is similar at each.
The best course in all of northern Michigan -- and that includes several eye-poppers in the Traverse City area to the west -- is the Tribute Course at the Otsego Club & Resort. Microsoft included this course in its "Links" computer game and with good reason -- it is drop-dead gorgeous. It's a course that nonplayers would enjoy looking at on a nature ride.

Currently, U.S. commanders responsible for each region of the world, or theater commanders, largely control how many special operations troops are sent to their areas and what missions they undertake. In the Middle East, for instance, such decisions now rest with Gen. James Mattis, the head of Central Command, and with Gen. John Allen, the top commander in Afghanistan.

Berry Pinney, chief engineer for WEWS Channel 5, said the station is already getting a flood of phone calls, which was expected.
Beyond the NCAA hearing is the outside notion that Tressel won't make it to August, that the 10-year coach would resign or be fired before that point. There is a possibility that Ohio State could face more severe sanctions with Tressel still at the school, a potential reason to let him go. But Ohio State hasn't learned any new information about the investigation since OSU President Gordon Gee and Athletic Director Gene Smith backed Tressel at a news conference on March 8.
Bryant's teammates felt even worse — for letting him down, especially fellow stars Andrew Bynum, who made just 4 of 11 shots for 11 points, and Pau Gasol, who was 1 for 10 for three points with three rebounds.
The commission, which spends about $1.5 million each year investigating fumigant alternatives, is putting its efforts into finding new production techniques. Several research projects are being carried out on a small plot overlooking the Monterey Bay off San Andreas Road. One is looking at using alternatives to soil, such as peat and coconut fibers. Another is exploring using mustard seed meal to suppress pathogens and encourage the growth of beneficial microbes. A third incorporates rice bran into the soil to create anaerobic conditions that are unfriendly to pathogens.

"Joseph was an older man who always wanted a child," Passanante said. "This was a dream come true for him … he wants justice for the kid who can't get it on his own."
Those and other dazzling moments are still there. But seen over the span of just eight days in a cycle that ended Thursday night, the production comes across as less than the sum of its parts. That's because Lepage has failed to dig beneath the surface of Wagner's epic tale of greed, betrayal, love and redemption. With no coherent vision of what the "Ring" might have to say to a modern audience, the production becomes an arid exercise in mechanics.
Though Tikun Olam will have a chance to re-apply for a charter by a mid-October deadline, the state has already denied the school’s application three times. School founder Sharon Akman could not be reached for comment.
“It would be very huge,” he said with his usually booming voice kept to a hushed tone. “It’s always been a dream of mine but, of course, everything has to be put in place, and right now me and my team are working very diligently to get that done. Again, I don’t want to speak about it too much as long as the basis of this story is ‘Shaq is trying,’ and I really am trying to bring a team.”
Colorado history has also been her story. From Chipeta, the so-called "Ute Princess," to Catharine Lee Bates, the English professor who gave us "America the Beautiful," to Pat Schroeder, one of the most powerful wits and women in modern-day politics, women have played starring roles.
An analysis of 2006 DWI arrest data showed that 50 percent of repeat offenders arrested that year avoided a conviction. Compare that with 38 percent in the Kansas City area, and 29 percent in the rest of the state.
Acta's Sunday lineup against lefty Bruce Chen didn't include Thome, who will need days off, especially days after night games. It did include Shelley Duncan as the DH, Jason Donald, Ezequiel Carrera, Jack Hannahan and Jerad Head. The starting outfield of Head, Carrera and Fukudome would sound more impressive as a firm specializing in international law.

The Tigers (1-2) then were held scoreless over the next 25:46 before freshman Tom Schreiber cashed in. Senior Tyler Moni cut the deficit to 7-5 with a goal past Chris Madalon 1:19 later, but UNC (5-1) responded with two shots past Tyler Fiorito over the first 2:33 of the fourth period to seal it.
Dominion's current replacement program was to run 25 years. But contractors replacing pipe since 2008 have found that newer pipe -- installed in the 1930s through the mid-1950s -- is also corroding because corrosion coatings, usually applied just before the pipe was buried, failed.

I always wanted to run the NEA so I could fund only tacky bourgeois art, such as Precious Moments figurines, thimble collections, dogs playing poker, velvet Elvis paintings, "Scarface" mirrors from the gift shops by the beach, etc. I'd have a major retrospective on Norman Rockwell paintings and make Thomas Kinkade our painter laureate.
Dickson's tome tells tales I had never heard, like the time former Sen. Eugene McCarthy's campaign asked Veeck if he'd permit the '76 presidential candidate to pinch-hit. Veeck thought it over and said no, a word he didn't use much. It didn't keep him from letting a 54-year-old Minnie Minoso suit up for the Sox or agreeing to son Mike's concept for a "Disco Demolition Night" in 1979, which led to a near-riot and the Sox's being forced to forfeit a game. Sometimes with a Veeck, you did have to accept a wreck.
On Monday afternoon in Erie, Presque Isle drew a modest crowd, with a license-plates in the parking lot indicating that Ohio customers did their share to make the turnout respectable.
Some hotels have begun catering to larger groups. The Park Hyatt Washington, for example, offers a special rate called "Families at the Park" that allows guests with several children to get an extra room for $75 a night.

According to the report, coal-fired power plants are the largest contributor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, which is why the Obama administration is making a big push for "clean coal." The Energy Department is funding demonstration projects with $4 billion in federal funds, matched by more than $7 billion in private investments.
"I think the coaching in the Big East has prepared me to coach against the best and play against the best, which is the same as this conference," she said. "Night in and night out, there isn't going to be a program that is intimidating, because I've been in those positions before and I've faced those positions before."

"Faith is a very strong presence in my life and it shows," says Calloway, 25, of Wilton Manors. "I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a person that doesn't have a story behind their tattoo. I deal with pain every day from my injuries in the Army, but when you get a tattoo, it's a way to take control of it."
Thinking about McInerney bothered him more, his friends said. Just driving by the coach's house, knowing he was in there and not in a cell, made him angry. At some point, he knew, he would have to testify before the grand jury, and he was mentally preparing himself for the moment.

Dunn: The Big Donkey was 4-for-12 with two home runs, a double and six RBIs in his weekend at Safeco Field, which isn’t the easiest place for a power guy to hit. His slash line (.246/.348/.509) is right about what the White Sox expected when they signed him to the four-year, $56-million contract at the 2010 winter meetings at Disney World. His .857 OPS is sixth among the AL’s regular DHs, just behind Billy Butler and ahead of Kendrys Morales and the slow-starting Jesus Montero. His early pace projects to 32 home runs and 140 RBIs. Dream on.
The next decent thing they could do - it isn't an exaggeration to suggest it could be the first smart thing they would have done in this matter - is to make sure Joe Paterno has coached his last game.

The Oregon-UCLA dual returns to Hayward Field in 2012, and – for the first time since it was renewed – will include the women's team. After that, everything is to be determined.
Criticism of hitting coaches is something that comes with that job. A hitting coach normally receives little credit when a team or individual is hot, but he gets dumped on when a team or individual slumps.

However, Quemin recognizes some positive changes, such as the FIAC's rebound, and the creation of private institutions like the Maison Rouge Foundation by Antoine de Galbert, as a balance to the state-sponsored system.

Regardless, the weekend storm should usher in much cooler conditions for next week. Current forecasts show sunny conditions and temperatures in the upper 50s and low 60s during the work week once the storm moves out Monday.
"I'm totally shocked and very, very saddened by the whole thing. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family, to his children and to his parents, and all of those very, very special people there. Junior, to me, was the epitome of what a football player was. The words that come to me are passion for the game. Passion for life. Intensity for the game. Intensity for life. Team player. One of the best I've ever been around in that respect. Tremendous team player. Tremendous leader. Tremendous leader on our football team. Love for the game. He was always the first to arrive and the last to leave each and every day of practice. Great practice player. One of the absolute best I've ever coached at any level. He used to frustrate our offensive coaches from time to time because of intensity at practice and his instincts. A guy that prepared greatly. He was always early in to study film. At the same he was tremendously instinctive. He relied on his instincts. But I believe a lot of those instincts were a result of preparation that he did in film preparation. I don't know of a player in the National Football League that had a greater effect on the community in which he played, than Junior Seau. The people in San Diego literally loved him. And he loved them. It was unbelievable the way they took to another. I don't know that there has been anyone that has done that much for their particular community they played in than Junior Seau. He was always upbeat. I never saw him down at any time in my experiences with him. He seemed to be very happy all the time. I think that's why this is such a shock to so many people because he was such a positive person and such an upbeat person. But I'm sure most of us probably never expected anything was going on in his life. My last experience I heard from him on this golf outing that he recently had. He had wrote me a letter of thanks. His last words were, ‘love you coach.' I'll cherish that. I only wish I had been able to be out there with him during that particular outing."

His zeal for cost-cutting and perceived mastery of risk did more than keep JPMorgan strong enough to bail out two failing competitors, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. It gave him a kind of street cred during the post-crisis years, when he lashed out at regulators who sought to rein in banks, and Occupy Wall Street protesters who raged against them.
But thats what happened Tuesday night as one of the states most accomplished political careers crashed to an end. Joining a list of moderate Republican incumbents around the nation who have lost to far-right challengers, Lugar now heads back to Washington, D.C., to finish up his sixth and final term.

The Smith Center is also a good reason for travelers to escape the crowded strip and head downtown. The trip can be a haul by taxi (and $40 if you tip the driver well), but there are things to see now. The Fremont Street Experience, with its $70 million light canopy, is a sensory overload, but surely unique, and the new Mob Museum is a lot of fun. Yes, it's devoted to the history of organized crime, and a little gruesome (you can have your photo taken in an electric chair), but its well-done and tells a good story.

So he lacked a precise sense of how precarious matters had gotten to be as he rolled to his right, retreating to the 38, and threw just before a blitzer crashed into him. "I was definitely a little fuzzy," McCoy said. "But I had enough sense not to throw it to somebody inbounds. I was always taught to throw it to the nickel seats."
There’s been a clamor among the impatient and beleaguered fan base to move the phenom along quickly. Get him to Double-A and beyond, maybe let him make a cameo in September.

There's, nothing wrong with finding love at work. Portland needs committed young do-gooders like Finn and Collymore, the kind of people who work too hard for actual social lives. But the connections I'm talking about aren't just romantic: Three of the five City Council members share the same political consultant, Mark Wiener, who also works with Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Kitzhaber and Attorney General John Kroger. Such ties are perfectly legal. But they aren't always harmless when it comes to how the public perceives government.

Unfortunately, your case falls into the "doozy" category; for some reason, your eustachian tubes aren't up to the bubble-passing task. Usually, it's temporary and happens when people fly with a cold or ear infection that has swollen their eustachian tubes. But for you, it's chronic, and that persistently unequal pressure affects your balance, making you dizzy and nauseous. The tubes your doc suggests will keep your ears ventilated.

The traditional model, in which the state issues its own bonds and runs the tollway, would allow the state to take advantage of its AAA credit rating, low interest rates and the promise of future toll revenue in obtaining up-front financing.

The book is not a literary triumph. However, it is revealing, offering some insight into Cain's tendency to deride the less successful, particularly other black people.

A contradiction if ever there was one, a Jekyll-and-Hyde boss as comfortable with firing people as hiring them, a convicted felon, a brilliant businessman, hated by Yankees fans early in his ownership and beloved by them at the end, and all along a man of immense largesse that only a few people saw, George Michael Steinbrenner III died of a massive heart attack at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Tampa this morning. Born on the Fourth of July, 1930, Steinbrenner was 80 years old.

The welcoming schedule -- seven of the 10 remaining January games are against teams with losing records -- comes at a time when the Blazers appear to be playing their best basketball of the season. The ball is moving, the pace has increased, and the bench is showing life, thanks to the discovery of a backup point guard in Patty Mills (10 points on Friday) and the resurrection of a scrapping Dante Cunningham.
Carlson added that questions about the health of the economy also contributed to the downturn. "People who can afford to buy (homes) in this economy have to feel confident that it is a good decision," he said.

ø5. NHL vice president Brendan Shanahan: General managers, coaches, players, fans and the media are all watching to see how Shanahan performs as the NHL's new judge in supplemental discipline decisions.

Now that Rose is back—on Sunday he made his first start since March 12—his teammates face an unlikely challenge: trying to re-establish chemistry with the star they were brought in to complement. In Sunday's overtime loss to the Knicks, Rose shot 31%, had a season-high eight turnovers and acknowledged afterward that he was "getting into rhythm." Even so, he led the Bulls with 29 points.

Worst in-my-face tourist moment: tip haggling in Italy. I had a wonderful meal at the Alla Madonna restaurant in Venice, but the good feelings abruptly ended when the senior waiter brought me the bill and in English said, "Make sure to add the tip." The service charge paid by Italian customers was already on the bill, along with the coperto – the small cover charge that usually includes the bread. But the tourists were evidently expected to pony up more because, as "everyone knows," Americans tip, and besides, the bills are confusing (and kept that way). I've had similar experiences in Tahiti and Argentina over the years. And, yes, I did add a little onto the bill – I shouldn't have. I am a generous tipper, but this was overt extortion.

Bush and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) threatened stronger punitive actions against North Korea if it reneged on a promise to padlock its sole nuclear reactor. A judge in Madrid indicted three U.S. soldiers in the 2003 death of Jose Couso, a Spanish journalist who was killed when their tank opened fire at a hotel in Baghdad.

"Besides that, it's been a Polish tradition for hundreds of years. It's always the day after Easter. Instead of Fat Tuesday, the day you party up before you fast for 40 days, this is the party after you're done fasting for the 40 days." Last year's event drew 1,500 partyers with hopes of 5,000 or more this year. In addition to a handful of polka bands rolling out the barrel all day and night, the festival includes Polish dishes, Polish beer and an accordion parade up West 55th Street. Then there's the name Dyngus. Now, for most folks dyngus is pronounced ding-gus and is another word for imbecile; however, Gorski points out the actual pronunciation is dean-goose, which is the name of a Polish pagan god. He doesn't take offense. "I'm just happy people are coming out at this point," Gorski laughed, "I'll correct how they say it later." Dyngus Day begins at noon Monday in the Gordon Square Arts District. For more information, visit ClevelandDyngus.com.

There are eight weeks left in this election. And although the conclusion may feel foregone, and the entertainment value largely sapped, there's still time to salvage the season. It'll mean ignoring the fluff and fire-breathing and demanding something better from our candidates. It'll mean asking why Schwarzenegger wants to veto Santa Monica Democratic state Sen. Sheila Kuehl's bill guaranteeing healthcare to all Californians. It'll mean considering why Schwarzenegger finally boosted the minimum wage in an election year, after vetoing it twice before. It'll mean demanding that Angelides can his campaign team and start acting like a sensible public servant rather than a seedy private investigator.
Four years ago, after a tough campaign, Robert A. Stefanik was elected mayor by fewer than 200 votes. The fact that he faces only nominal opposition this fall speaks to how well he has done.

The president wants to end the American combat role in Afghanistan by December 2014 and turn responsibility for the country's security over to the Afghan national army and police. American troops remaining in the country after that would be limited to an advisory and training role. But the president's plan depends on getting the Afghan security forces fully up and running well before U.S. troops begin withdrawing. That strategy could be fatally undermined if continuing violent anti-American protests force U.S. troops to leave prematurely.

In Israel religion is inextricably interwoven with politics and politics is about power.

That's proven to be very successful.

John Cusack makes a realistic, nicely sardonic and properly pasty-looking, Poe. He holds a gun precisely twice during the film; once he drops it, and the second time he fires and misses. Repeatedly. (Perhaps this is the true reason the man was drummed out of West Point.)
Apple has popularized tablet computers with its iPads. That is hurting PC sales in the U.S. and other industrialized countries. Smartphones such as Apple's iPhones are also delaying PC replacements among consumers.
It also looked as though anything could have happened in Game 6: As Wade sat on the bench in the third period, marinating in his misery as a trainer tried to stretch some life into an apparently lifeless left arm, his usual game face was replaced by a mask contorted in pain.

GUNTOWN, Miss. -- Hope was fading that two young sisters abducted from their Tennessee home would be found alive two weeks after they vanished: Their kidnapper had already killed their mother and sister, and he was armed with a pistol as officers closed in.

Next, Kenston was second in the 800 relay as Weilacher, Lenny Stanley, Andrew Soltay and Richards earned a time of 1:31.25.
Since my early teens, it has been obvious to me how miserable my father had made my mother, and also himself. Both of them have spent the entirety of their youth without an emotional and physical connection with another human being. Even as a teen, out of empathy, I would hope that they would find someone to connect with, to share with, to love and to be loved by, if only in passing. More for my mother than my father, but I did wish he'd been less lonely and miserable and made the rest of us less miserable too.
In court documents, A-B said it had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the sponsorship over the past 30 years. A-B, which is owned by Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch InBev, also has separate sponsorship agreements with 26 of the league's 30 teams, including the St. Louis Cardinals.
As Rob Rogers said in presenting his scheme to the National Capital Planning Commission, "the Ellipse as a lawn is the centerpiece" of the winning design.

Born Jamesetta Hawkins to a single mother in Los Angeles, Etta James began singing in church as a young girl. Along with the Peaches, she scored her first R&B hit in 1955 with "The Wallflower (Dance With Me Henry)," and crossed over to a wider audience five years later with the "At Last" album, released through the Chess subsidiary Argo Records.
That, in turn, is creating unrest among China's citizens, which eventually could threaten the social stability that China's Communist Party leadership seems to prize above everything else. Public health and environmental concerns now get much attention (or lip service, depending on your perspective) from top leaders, but actually attaining the new goals is a difficult task. Many local leaders have been indoctrinated with the idea that economic growth trumps every other consideration. Even if they bought in totally and committed enormous resources, the sheer magnitude of the cleanup would be daunting.
I found the pace of the clam-shell vehicles to be particularly plodding on preview rides during the attraction’s test-and-adjust phase. Hopefully the speed will pick up when the ride officially opens Friday.
Interestingly, Jolie had said as recently as December 2011 in an interview on ABC's "Nightline" about her children and their desire for her and Pitt to get married, "We've explained to them that our commitment when we decided to start a family was the greatest commitment you could possibly have. Once you have six children, you're committed."

“We are stunned that without any medical background into the health and medical condition of Sal that The Star-Ledger is printing medical information obtained from God only knows where,” Sciarra said. “Sal is a decorated officer with a spotless employment record and despite the invitation to discuss his private medical issues in the pages of The Star-Ledger, we decline to do so. All appropriate paperwork was filed with Edison’s insurance, a fact long known to Sal’s superiors. Further, the linkage suggested and the aspersion cast that Sal acted inappropriately in the arrest of Germe, whose lawsuit seeks a taxpayer-funded payday after pleading guilty to assaultive, resistive conduct, including trying to disarm a police officer, is really scraping the barrel.”
The biggest problems may not come until death do you part. Although same-sex spouses are legally entitled to inherit assets from each other whether there's a will or not, since inheritance is governed through state law, they don't have federal rights.
The Kings had an 8-0 shots advantage before Quick finally faced a shot at 9:21, then handled the Blues' power play for their second short-handed goal of the series when Brown stole the puck from Carlo Colaiacovo in the St. Louis zone and fed it in front to Kopitar, who had enough time to stretch Elliott across the crease to the breaking point.

One thing I can recommend without major reservation is BLT's passion fruit crepe souffle. Though, as a free-form, half-moon served dripping in passion fruit sauce served on an ungarnished plate, it channels more of a jiggly diner omelette than a souffle. But, looks aside, it's a perfect fluffy custard bursting with tropical notes, the kind of original pastry a chain restaurant would be too afraid to serve.

Not Colts owner Jim Irsay.
Sandusky is accused of sexually abusing 10 boys over a 15-year span. He has denied the allegations.
But machismo was raring upstairs on the predominantly male line. Anything was fair game: how one had more burn scars than the other, how another had two herniated disks but still worked service - albeit, a little slumped over - how a third could break down a chicken faster than his sober colleague after drinking a bottle of whiskey. And whenever a young woman came in to the kitchen, the kicking shut of oven doors, unnecessary flambeing and lewd remarks reached a fever pitch.

The bill still needs another, recorded vote in the Senate before going over to the House, where it will need at least another four OKs before it can go to the governor.
"I thought we played great defense in the third quarter and then right at the beginning of the fourth quarter we created a little separation and we gave it all back so easily that then it was just a matter of who was going to make the plays at the end," Suns coach Alvin Gentry said. "They made plays and we didn't."
øCash flowed into ultra-safe investments such as U.S. Treasurys, pushing the yield on the 10-year note as low as 1.80%, near a seven-month low. The yield finished the day at 1.84% as stocks moved off their earlier lows.
Others questioned how much actual work Paterno did in his later years. He always went out of his way to heap praise on his veteran assistants, especially if an injury prevented him from getting in a player's face in practice or demonstrating a technique.
"It's really position-specific. We run four-receiver sets, which they never did in the past. Those guys are relied on to block heavily in the run game and they have to run good routes and catch the ball. The line is doing more zone blocking, so that changes their approach.
Also in focus, the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee reaffirmed its commitment to keeping interest rates low at least through late 2014. At an afternoon press conference, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said he would not hesitate to support the economy with more easing, if need be.
Would she say yes?
The splashdown is not too harrowing, and the landing pool is reasonably shallow and easy to exit. More alarming was what appeared to be the color of the water, which I choose to call "Radioactive Gatorade" rather than "Body Fluid." Upon closer inspection, that yellowish hue was created by the flooring, not the water. (Note that the water immediately at the end of the slide is the usual lovely blue, and there's a distinct line where it changes.)
Despite his inability to reach base with any kind of consistency, Gordon went into Saturday as the major league leader in steals with 10.
A universal health care system that everyone paid into and that covered everyone would mean that we would pay half what we pay now for health care — and get better treatment as well.
Expect junior John Simon and senior Nathan Williams to get after people on the defensive line. Tyler Moeller, C.J. Barnett and Christian Bryant should bring some excitement to the safety and star spots.

Pierzynski took Hunter’s first delivery – a high 90-mph fastball – down the right-field line and off the foul pole for his fourth homer of the season.

Offensively, the Buckeyes rely on foul calls, their best offense feeding the ball to Sullinger and letting him work inside, which often means getting to the free-throw line. He shot 10 free throws in the second half against Purdue and is third in the Big Ten in free throws attempted.
When it comes to Polish Sauerkraut Soup, requested by H.F. of Wheaton, the slow-cooker version in The Everything Slow Cooker Cookbook by Margaret Kaeter is as tasty and easy as it gets.

I remember giving Jim a warning on that first fateful night: "OK, here we are, but I am not running." Then the teacher introduced himself. "I'm Skyline's track coach," he said. "We'll start every class with some stretching and then a 30-minute run."
The restaurant, which also has a raw bar in front and a sophisticated seafaring interior, specializes in platters ($40, $60 and $90). It also offers three kinds of sashimi, including ahi ($8), salmon ($7) and halibut ($7.50), or a sampling of all three for $9. The nicely sliced fish is served on a glass plate with soy, sweet pickled ginger and a dollop of very bad, runny wasabi that was grainy and tasted like undissolved powder. I was also disappointed in the peel-and-eat shrimp ($8), a perennial favorite, because they were tough and didn't have much flavor.

"We are producing record levels of natural gas," said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil and gas analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. in New York.

On Monday, the Supreme Court will commence a nearly unprecedented six hours of oral argument concerning the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed into law two years ago tomorrow. The most significant challenge to the act involves the "individual mandate," which compels most individuals to purchase health insurance by 2014 or suffer a monetary penalty. Challengers claim that the provision violates the Commerce Clause, under which Congress has broad authority to regulate interstate commerce, and that sustaining the mandate would permit Congress to enact laws requiring individuals to do whatever it chooses. Both arguments are mistaken. The ACA is consistent with long-standing precedent allowing Congress to tackle regulatory problems affecting commerce that states are ill-suited to solve on their own.

Santorum flashed a goofy grin and raised his eyebrows as he entered. He spoke about his ill daughter, his grandfather in the coal mines, his sweater vests and topics from Iran to the "moral enterprise that is America." The closest he came to supporting Romney was a vow to "make sure that we defeat President Barack Obama." (He ignored shouted questions about whether he would endorse Romney.)
If Thanksgiving weren't synonymous with gravy, butter and other festively dressed saturated fats, it would be the healthiest holiday around.

The athletic, 6-foot outside hitter was her own worst critic, getting down on herself and her team during the season.

“Maybe that person is mistrustful of law enforcement,” he said. “Maybe they have had a bad experience with the FBI, or they may have the attitude that the offer is too good to be true, that they are saying to themselves, ‘I’m going to be paraded before the media and arrested and jailed.’ That’s absolutely not the case.”
