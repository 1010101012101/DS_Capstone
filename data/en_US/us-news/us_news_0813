øThe rest, as they say, is history: With an actual use for the long-dormant adhesive, Silver and Fry were able to get the sticky notes on 3M's new product agenda, and by 1977, they began by giving the notes to secretaries and showed them how, by writing notes on the sticky paper, documents could be kept neat and clean. 3M marketers were encouraged by the fact that within the company, the notes had become outrageously popular. Taking a play out of the Fry notebook, two 3M marketers flew to Idaho for what has become known in company folklore as the "Boise Blitz." They saturated the office supply industry with free samples and found that an astonishing 90% of the consumers who tried the now renamed "Post-it Notes" said they would purchase the product. In 1981, one year after its introduction, Post-it Notes were named the company's "outstanding new product." In 1990, ten years after their introduction, Post-its were named one of the top consumer products of the decade.

"I would think he's not the kind of guy who would probably stay single," Levy said. "If he's not with Stifler's mom, then he's out trying to reform some hooker some place, I don't know.

* The early Blues had choices to make in advancing to the Stanley Cup Final (losing each time, obviously) in the first three seasons of the franchise. In 1967-68, the immortal Glenn Hall was the man in goal. In 1968-69, the equally immortal Jacques Plante played in 10 games, Hall in three. In 1969-70, three goaltenders saw extensive postseason action: Hall played 421 minutes, Plante 324, and Ernie Wakely 216. Plante went 4-1, Hall 4-3 and Wakely 0-4. (Having not been around then, I'd be curious to know why coach Scotty Bowman played not one, not two, but three goaltenders so extensively in the 1969-70 playoffs. I was a hockey fan back then, but only about 10,11 years old... cannot remember. Sorry. I defer to the Blues' historians.)

"After you have seven years of noncompliance (with federal mandates), something drastic has to happen to change the climate, change the culture of the school, change the learning, really influence teachers to do a better job within the classroom," said Joseph Martino, interim superintendent in Roselle, which received a grant. "This community is on the brink of change." Abraham Clark High School in Roselle will receive $3.8 million. It is one of four schools in the state which selected the "turnaround model."

The 8th Circuit panel put her decision on hold four days later, and this order was a more permanent stay of her ruling.

But while Google Drive allows you both to access to your PC and Mac files and collaborate in real time on Google documents, I do worry a little about users being confused by the various types of documents.

I think books can often be shorter, and they have to be snappier. In general, we've seen society somersaulting toward sensationalism. And I'm not so sure that's always a good thing. If you watch television or listen to the news, we're drowned in sensationalism. There's this abject desire to face the extreme, and I think that's a little out of hand. And I like to put the brakes on that, to decelerate that trend rather than accelerate it, and show that ideas and feelings in books matters.

"This is the ultimate cold case," said Ron Fine, the Dayton, Ohio, amateur paleontologist who spotted the fossil on a hillside last year and gave it its name.
In this situation, a credit card dispute might help. I say "might" because the law limits the types of disputes that must be processed, both in terms of time and geographic proximity. Questioning a charge on an overseas hotel booked almost a year ago would require a first-rate bank or credit union that stands behind its customers.
The revelation came to light after the Federal Aviation Administration released a list of agencies certified to fly drones and unmanned aerial vehicles. The Gadsden Police Department was on the list.

“I could beat any of them any time,” said Sarah, 12.
The governor rightly took credit for his first-year achievements. His victories included delivering a balanced budget, even as he restored integrity and competence in state government. (Plus, though he was too modest to mention it, he didn’t steal anything and he didn’t sleep with any hookers.)
The hard part, as I see it from my experiences, is when families start any treatment other than pain control and other comfort measures. Once treatments begin, to stop them feels like a positive action to terminate the life of their loved one. Once a person is intubated, the only way to remove the tube is by a positive action, and that requires a decision to remove it. It is much easier, morally, to have never placed the breathing tube in the first place. Likewise, if tube feedings are begun at some point, to remove the tube feels like the loved one is being intentionally starved to death. It is much easier, morally, to have never begun the tube feedings and let nature take its course.
Admittedly, chardonnay generally isn't my favorite wine variety. But I find that a chardonnay with sufficient acidity can pair beautifully with the sweetness of the crab and cut through the richness of the melted butter that's served on the side. I steer away from anything that's too oaky or alcoholic, as they can overwhelm the crab. A real plus is minerality in the wine, because it matches nicely with the briny notes in the crab. That makes the flinty chardonnay from France's Chablis region a great partner.
Leslie Brody's biography of the second-to-youngest sister, "Irrepressible: The Life and Times of Jessica Mitford," is among the latest contributions to the family business. (Deborah, the Duchess of Devonshire and the only surviving Mitford, published a memoir last month.) The industry still thrives. Of course, Jessica made her name beyond being "the communist one" by actively investigating commercial syndicates, peeling back marketing jargon and questionable pricing practices to uncover corruption and profiteering, most prominently with her blockbuster "The American Way of Death," the still-classic exposé of the funeral industry, first published in 1963.

Results: After the first day of screening with four tests, more than one-third of the men and one-fourth of the women had a false alarm. By the 14th test, the false-positive rate climbed to 60percent for men and 49percent for women. In one extreme case, 10 of one man's 14 screenings returned false-positive results. Flexible sigmoidoscopy accounted for the largest share of false positives, followed by chest X-rays.

Eaton was ecstatic afterward. In comments e-mailed by his management group, Eaton said: "I'm so happy. I had a great day. I think this was a great experience. I am most proud of the way I competed. After some bad events, I was able to come back and perform well today. I made some bars in the pole vault on the third attempt when I really needed them."

It happened to me, and to add insult to injury, I still haven't gotten the receipt they were supposed to mail to my home address.

While Mr. Ehrlich himself may not suffer from the social disease of bigotry, his argument give aid and comfort to those who do by failing to draw a fundamental distinction. Marriage-as-a-sacrament, performed as a religious ceremony, is not the same as marriage-as-a-contract, which grants people certain civil rights, such as filing joint tax returns, rights of survivorship, and inheritance of property. No one at all is asking a church that opposes same-sex marriage to perform one. Indeed, if marriage were only a sacrament, non-believers would not be entitled to it either.

Let's not romanticize the college experience or pretend we don't understand what Rosenhaus was doing. The louder the agent shouts, the easier it is for the quarterback to appear quiet and humble, regardless of whether that's reality. We get it. Guys want to chase a dream, want to get paid, want to throw passes to Chad Ochocinco, then have the Bengals wide receiver tweet about your arm strength the way he did about Pryor on Tuesday.
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly oil a 2-quart baking dish. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add rice and salt to taste and cook at a slow boil until the rice is tender but still a little undercooked - about 15 minutes for white rice, 30 minutes for brown rice. Rinse briefly with cool water, shake off excess water and transfer rice to a mixing bowl.
NEW YORK — In the hustle-bustle and controlled chaos between games Monday evening, Miguel Batista walked into a small room a few paces away from the Mets clubhouse.

Moreover, Yoga in general has yet to win my affection, mostly because I value flexibility less than power and speed. Where some clear their heads by chanting and meditating, I do it by running, and that leaves me with unusually tight legs and hips, which make even "easy" Yoga poses uncomfortable.
I remember one cold, wet Halloween long ago when my Mom decided it would be fun to serve hot chocolate to trick-or-treaters who came calling. Keeping with the spirit of the evening, she got a cast iron pot that dangled from a metal tripod, made for cooking over an open campfire, and set it up in our dining room on top of some Sterno flames. Then she dressed up like a witch, and when kids arrived, she offered them a cup of "magic potion" to enjoy. It was a big hit, and a welcome dose of warmth on a chilly night.
Cuyahoga County employees are given a per diem for food that ranges from $30 to $45 a day, depending on where they travel.
In truth, the best part of the competition was not the money, but the reforms the state made, or pledged, in order to win. But these were minor, compared to the problems. And they're hardly guaranteed.
"You can go to Limantour on any busy weekend day and walk 10 to 15 minutes from the parking lot entrance to the beach, and you'll be away from people," said John Dell'osso, chief of interpretation and resource education for Point Reyes National Seashore. If you walk west toward the end of the peninsula and cross 300 yards of dunes to the estuary, you may see thousands of bat rays and leopard sharks in their nursery and feeding grounds.

A: When it comes to my future I don't foresee myself ever not writing. "SNL" is just still so exciting that if I spent too much time thinking and planning what I was doing next, it would end up being a big mistake. For me, I just count myself very lucky that I've had this same incredible job for as long as I've had and, you know, if the next one is even half as fun as this, I'll be so lucky.

After the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy was lifted last year, gay and lesbian soldiers who came out to their comrades in arms reported being met with shrugs. High school students form gay-straight alliance groups. Celebrities line up to condemn bullying of gay youth. On TV shows like "Modern Family," ''Grey's Anatomy" and "Smash," gay characters get married, adopt children and kiss on screen, to little public outcry; within the storylines, they're just part of the cast.

Dissent centered not on the winners’ merits but on the process. Committee members had 12 hours or less to inspect key documents after Mayor Kasim Reed’s administration couriered them to their homes late Tuesday night. The last-minute delivery was not an effort to keep a contentious issue out of the limelight, said Louis Miller, the city’s aviation general manager.
The pace with which urbanization has overtaken the city since those days astonishes the McClellans, who agree the biggest change has been the amount of new housing and commercial developments replacing former farmland.
Sullivan calls in his boss, Will Emerson (Paul Bettany), who in turn calls in his boss, Sam Rogers (Spacey).

OMG!!!!! I would make trips home to my parents from Atlanta and pray I always had a Friday stay in Parma with them. The thought of a Friday fish fry makes me salivate. The best was at the Gray Wolf Tavern in Cleveland. It did not matter what time you were there because the line would come out the front door, down the sidewalk and into the parking lot.

Grilled cheese, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, egg creams - you’ll just want to wrap yourself into the warm cocoon Schnackenberg’s food provides.
He or she needs to embody some quality the candidate needs help with, whether it's youthful conservative energy (Sarah Palin), blue-collar empathy (Joe Biden) or just adult supervision (Dick Cheney). He or she needs to be smart enough to survive a debate with the vice presidential candidate from the other side, and steady enough to avoid gaffes that get in the way of the campaign's message. (That's why Palin was such a disaster for John McCain.) And, if possible, he or she should help the candidate carry an important state - although that's optional (Palin wasn't chosen for Alaska, nor Cheney for Wyoming, but Biden spent a lot of time in Pennsylvania, the state of his birth).

"There is absolutely no evidence that school closing is a school improvement strategy," Fine said.

Formerly known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, the firm moved into a newly built office building near Ford Field in late 2005 just before Super Bowl XL in February 2006.

Ms. Newhouse has visited every building she writes about, attending multiple performances and interviewing architects, acousticians, managers and users. What concerns her most is the connection between the visual and the aural, the relationship of the art of design to the act of listening, a synthesis that can take us into the sublime, one of the most complex and powerful experiences that architecture can provide. (And please, let's get rid of that old chestnut about architecture being frozen music, which is just as ridiculous as music being melted architecture, which fortunately no one has suggested yet.)
It's milk that has not been pasteurized, acquired from hoofed mammals such as cows, goats or sheep.

OCHOPEE, fla. — The tourists in their rental cars creep down the Everglades byway known as Loop Road. Some are searching for alligators, exotic birds or maybe a ghost orchid.

And when they find the old metal Lucky Strike cigarette sign and grave marker by the side of the road, they hit the brakes and head in.

I have heard the argument that homogenization contributes to heart disease, and I don't buy it. As the theory goes, there is an enzyme in cow's milk (xanthine oxidase) that is not well absorbed. But when the milk is homogenized, the enzyme is absorbed to a greater degree. The xanthine oxidase from homogenized milk then supposedly causes changes in our arteries and marches us down the road to heart disease.
He also casts much-needed attention on the potential "tigers" in the European periphery, often ignored in the investor stampede to rising Asia. And the list goes on: He wisely raises the relationship between cost of capital and credit discipline and, in turn, investment returns; the crucial role of savings; and the dangers of a premature welfare state.

Some time ago, my husband asked me to fulfill a fantasy of his by watching me have sex with someone else. I eventually gave in and when it happened, the guy was very good at making love. So much so that I agreed to remove the condom he was wearing and meet him again the next day. We continued to meet, and each time he got me to submit to more and more until pics and videos were taken, and soon I was shared with his friends — one at a time and then at the same time. The thing is, I don’t want it to stop. Is there a danger, other than STDs, that having so many sexual partners presents?
In the past, automakers have responded to currency problems by slashing cash-back incentives and cut-rate leases.

So what was the deal? Behind the scenes, voices whispered that Jamison had been forced out as chief executive.

A cold front would continue pushing southward through the Eastern half of the country. The system would obtain ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and trigger scattered showers and thunderstorms, some of which may turn severe as the system has a history of producing large hail, damaging winds and heavy rainfall. Most areas along the front would see near an inch of rain, while areas under severe storm development may see between 2 to 3 inches. This front and associated showers would help to alleviate the region from unbearably hot conditions. Highs would remain in the 90s, with heat indicies reaching above 100 degrees.

A previous proposal that would have limited current employee payouts to $15,000 — regardless of days already saved up — was considered unconstitutional, said Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), chairman of the budget committee. A law signed in March limits future hires to saving up $15,000 worth of time off.
It also said that the law doesn't allow companies to turn a blind eye to evidence of infringements, although the panel didn't explain how to avoid "willful blindness" other than by monitoring users.

Practically speaking, the bulk of "effective" greenhouse gases are nothing more than water vapor.
A: In Japan, officials are concerned that people may be exposed to radiation levels high enough to cause elevated rates of cancer, especially thyroid cancer. The risks are hard to measure. Fallout from nuclear bomb testing in Nevada during the 1950s exposed some people in Utah to as much as 16 times the dose of radiation they would have otherwise received from natural sources. These downwinders showed elevated rates of thyroid cancer, but researchers still can't precisely calculate the risk. Within five years after the Chernobyl disaster, researchers saw a sharp increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer in young people in Belarus. Rates of thyroid cancer rose to five to eight times the expected level in the most highly exposed children.

Among the plans that never came to fruition was a plot to kill Obama. Bin Laden ordered a lieutenant to set up a terrorist team near Bagram air base in Afghanistan that would be ready to blow up the president's plane if he arrived for a surprise visit, as he did Tuesday, the first anniversary of Bin Laden's death. Bin Laden wrote to one of his lieutenants that assassinating Obama would put a "totally unprepared" Vice President Joe Biden in charge of the country, "which will lead the U.S. into a crisis."

DeKalb County is a heavyweight in the region, with 398,286 registered voters, which represent 17.5 percent of the 10-county region’s voters. Its voter turnout, if it follows historical patterns, could be a quarter of the entire regional vote in the referendum, more than any other county’s. And according to early polling by the Livable Communities Coalition, without support in Fulton and DeKalb, the referendum could not muster a win in the region overall.

You should be advised that the term "part time" as it might show up in a classified ad is not rigidly defined.

When Ahmad Bradshaw became the starter in 2010, Jacobs’ role began to shrink and at times he was less effective when running laterally. But these past two seasons, he was still a vocal presence and did a good job when Bradshaw was sidelined by a stress fracture in his foot and benched for a half against the Dallas Cowboys. (Jacobs had 101 yards and two touchdowns against Dallas.)

The Aviary flips the traditional tasting menu on its head. Here, cocktails take center stage: They're served with nibbles that complement the drinks' flavor profiles. During the seven-course degustation, sips were sent out in architecturally inspired glassware. Ginger-spiked apple brandy cider arrived in a metal-lined glass canteen. Shortly after, a rocks glass encased by a plastic pillow was placed on my table, then cut open, sending forth a cloud of lavender-scented vapors. Then came a warm Rooibos tea cocktail (the Rooibos tea leaf hails from Africa) delivered in a coffee siphon. Using that device's vacuum pressure, the drink's gin and maraschino components were infused with flavors from lavender, citrus, cinnamon and the tea leaves.

About 15,000 vacant and abandoned houses pockmark Cuyahoga County, most of them awaiting costly demolition. The region no longer attracts immigrant waves of a size that built ethnic neighborhoods. But it does draw a small and steady stream of refugees, people forced to flee their homelands because of war or persecution.
1. Trade up: This is no longer appears to be an option. Although some experts predict teams will try to jump up over the Browns to draft Tannehill or Blackmon at No. 3, Heckert promised the Browns will either stay put at No. 4 or trade down, probably no lower than the eighth overall pick. This would seem to indicate that the Browns are fine letting the Dolphin leapfrog them for Tannehill or the Rams climb up for Blackmon. But insiders says the Dolphins are unlikely to scramble up from No. 8 to No. 3, because they're also trying to build through the draft and don't want to surrender picks.

We drove back toward the city center, but stopped short and parked near the Botanical Gardens. While organized into sectors, the gardens feels more like a lovingly cared-for park, a prime spot for wandering, sunning, watching the punt drivers (think Kiwi gondola rides) navigating the lazy Avon river through town - and for forgetting that the nearby Central Business District resembles a heavily bombed war zone.

Also, the extra balance work doesn't necessarily translate to more toning, burning significantly more calories or getting more fitness bang for your buck. Evidence: A team of University of Wisconsin researchers tested three brands of toning shoes, including rocker-bottom and regular ones, with active women. After a dozen five-minute spins on the treadmill wearing different shoes, the scientists compared differences in muscle activity in the walkers' calves, quads, hamstrings, buttocks, back and abs, and found, well, squat. Doing lunges and squats and practicing one-legged standing in addition to normal walking give you greater toning, more core strength and better balance. And they're free!

Lyme may be identified after a tick bite, for example, by an expanding rash that looks like a bull's-eye. But that doesn't always happen, and even after a tick bite, antibodies against Lyme may not show up for weeks, so early blood tests can turn up false negatives. Symptoms such as fatigue, chills, fever, headache and swollen lymph nodes may be misdiagnosed. Some infections can go undetected for months or even years. When caught early, tick-borne diseases can be treated successfully with two weeks of antibiotics, but doctors and researchers still argue about whether a chronic form of Lyme exists, and whether it should be treated with longer courses of the drugs.

The Billikens made free throws, which is no small feat for them, and got defensive stops when they needed them. Lights-out 3-point shooting had staked them to a big lead - Rob Loe finished with 14 points and Cody Ellis with 11 - but in the end, it was their shooting from 15 feet that won it. In the final 6:13 of the game, SLU missed just one of 14 free throws. Xavier would cut the lead to three points, commit a foul, and SLU would go to the line and make two. As close as Xavier got, the Musketeers never had a chance to tie the score again.

Hey, Tony: Seeing that we are in the rebuild mode, why prolong the process? If we have learned anything in the past five years, rebuilding a team -- if run by people who know football -- does not have to take 4-5 years.

Even the national media thought we were taking strides but were baffled when free agency wasn't utilized. -- Eliot Clasen, Cape Coral, Fla.

So I would say it's not so much things that I did, but I really was set up for it by great parents.

The cupcakes ($3.50) are easily shareable. Four wedges for one cupcake gave just the right bite of sweet to four salivating adults.
