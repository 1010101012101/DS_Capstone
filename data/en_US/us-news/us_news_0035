For a rural activist, Chen had gathered a wide following, a testament to what supporters describe as his generous spirit and determination to fight injustice. His exposure of forced abortions and sterilizations in his community so angered officials, they persecuted him, sending him to jail for four years and then upon his release confining him to his home, where he was isolated and occasionally beaten.

"Grace" attempts to go deeper. Working with director Jayne Wenger, Newman has created an impressionistic portrait of Paley drawn almost entirely from her poems, stories and essays. The snippets of biography don't add up to a full life of the author who died in 2007. What emerges instead is a sometimes rambling but evocative look at Paley as daughter, writer, mother, feminist, wife, peacenik, teacher and passionate lover.

From Breves, we continued on another smaller, but faster vessel that spent most of the day plying through narrow passages. None of the terrain was more than a few feet above sea level. The villages that dotted the shore were built high up on stilts and populated largely by fishermen and those working in the ever present lumber mills. The homes were usually colorfully painted and connected together by a series of catwalks. As we skirted the shore veering to the left or the right through the narrow corridors, the boat often stopped briefly for passengers, who boarded quickly by leaping aboard during the few seconds that the boat came near their dock.

"Under democracy one party always devotes its chief energies to trying to prove that the other party is unfit to rule -- and both commonly succeed, and are right." -- Writer H.L. Mencken.
But the key here isn't in any conventional element, it's in the sustained air of sketch-comedy absurdism, the comically overdone gestures, the random bursts of joyfully naive dance and song (although the Katie Griesar score doesn't stand out here as much as usual), and little curlicues of language and logic. When Cinder first decides she needs a cleaner, she picks up the phone and say, "Can I have the number for the Yellow Pages?" Later on, Ink Blot (played with customary verve by Mouawad), confesses, "My father, he beat me with a calendar on the 31st of every month." (Prompting the quizzical response, "So, not every month?")

Temporary cash assistance provides emergency financial aid to families with children under 18. Unlike the food supplement program, the state receives a lump sum of federal money for temporary cash assistance, and that sum does not increase no matter the demand. If applications surge (as they did from 2007 to 2010), the state must make do as best it can. It cannot ask the federal government for more money.

Yet the food DePersio serves at Fascino is nothing like the familiar Italian food at so many Jersey restaurants. This food is lighter, and it's not just that the heavy sauces are gone. This is a European renaissance. DePersio brings French techniques to Italian food, and the result is something elemental and transcendent, with a gnocchi, for example, that seems to defy the laws of physics. Perhaps this is what DePersio meant when he named the place -- you will be fascinated by his ability to take a basic dish and elevate it to an ethereal version of itself.

Both of those national surveys, as well as polls done by other organizations, reflect a sharp jump in recent years in support for same-sex marriage. In 2004, for example, Pew found Americans opposed gay marriage by a nearly 2-1 margin. Such a large and sudden shift in public opinion on a fundamental issue of social policy is extremely rare and reflects two trends that have overlapped -- younger Americans are far more supportive of same-sex marriage than their elders, and middle-aged Americans have shifted their views.
The fact that the movie has very little to do with sex and more to do with emotions is just a double-whammy. Not only does it explore the feminine side of a macho archetype -- cowboys -- it's about feelings. Eww.
Over and over, dinner guests would tell her that she needed to sell her recipe commercially. But rather than jumping right in, she surveyed grocers and other retailers to gauge demand.

I am at a total loss to see what these four council members were thinking. I understand the two who will not be running again. The other two will face the voters again. I had thought that Mr. Stone would become a very good council member. That does not appear to be the case. I feel the same about Ms. Nihart. No one on that council will ever see a vote from me. I will work very hard to see them be defeated. These people did no research as to what voters thought. Many, including myself, had no idea that Jaquith had the guts to apply for this.

This year, well before the Republicans have nominated their standard-bearer, buyer's remorse already appears to be setting in about their apparent but not inevitable front-runner, Mitt Romney.

Dear Margo: I recently was baptized and joined the Mormon Church. I really enjoy my new "family" except for one person: the bishop. This feeling is taboo because people act like he walks on water. I say he is just a man appointed to a position. This man didn't like me the minute he met me. When I started at this church, I was in crisis, and I told a couple of people about it. They said go to the bishop. He turned me down flat-out and said, "We don't help people financially." That was a bald-faced lie, and I knew it. The excuses I got were that I was not a member yet, that he was stressed, blah, blah, blah. As time progressed, my problem became worse. Again, I was turned down, and he didn't even call me by the right name. I corrected him twice about my name, and he still got it wrong, which was proof to me that he was doing it on purpose. Do you think I am making something out of nothing? And to whom do I go to let someone know about this person? I think he treats me badly because I am disabled. (I think this because there are other disabled people who also dislike him.) — Disillusioned

Not everything is high end, though. Pastas start at $18 for the penne with eggplant and asparagus. The house-made veal ravioli special with truffle sauce, flavorful but light as an air kiss, went for $22. Chicken Fiorentino, a menu regular for the same price, comes in a generous portion but lacks excitement despite the presence of lump crab meat and spinach, as well as a chardonnay sauce. More definition would make it memorable. Along those lines, the grilled quail special ($26) stuffed with figs and Gorgonzola offered a savvy statement over wild mushroom risotto.
"I think it's been an evolutionary process of respecting and learning to appreciate the fact that, regardless of whether an individual understands the nature of the relationships and the situation, that it really comes down to basic equity and fairness for a human being," he said.

But in representative government, the resort to parliamentary trickery or secrecy -- think of it as the old hidden-law trick -- does real violence to the credibility of the legislative process itself. It hurts the reputation of the offending party, too, but that's not nearly as important as the damage done to the principle that the American government is the American people.

Our changing stateColorado's 1960 population was 1.8 million; now we've passed 5.1 million. The state covers 66.3 million acres, or 104,247 square miles. Forty-two percent of that is public land — city, county, state and national. In 1962, we had 39.9 million acres of privately owned farms and ranches creating the legendary Western landscape; today it's 31.3 million acres. We've lost 8.6 million acres of ag land, the open space we crave, and food producers. (A hopeful note: more than 1.8 million acres of open space, primarily farms and ranches, are now protected by conservation easements against development.)

Four young musicians came together to jam for a couple of hours at Sam Phillips' Sun Records label one day in Memphis. It was Dec. 4, 1956. All of the men, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins, went on to become legendary figures in rock music, pop culture and the ethos of Americana. But at the time, they had no idea they would come to be known as a "Million Dollar Quartet."

-- Give manager Bob Melvin bonus points for naming Yoenis Céspedes the A's center fielder early in spring training, over the strong objections of Coco Crisp. It was a vote of confidence in the new guy, a sign to him that the team believes he belongs.

Judging by the way Childs played against Iowa State's talented front court in Kansas State's 67-63 win over Iowa State in Thursday's quarterfinal, the Wildcats just might have a fighting chance to stay on the court against the Bears, 32-0, who walloped Texas Tech 72-48 in their quarterfinal.

"I don't think there are any guarantees in this situation, from what it sounds like," he said. "He really needs to come in and prove not only to the coaching staff, but to the players that he's really a changed guy- not only in spring training or that first month of the season, but he's got to carry that over through the rest of the season. That's the big thing. That's going to be a huge thing, trust-wise, for the players and the organization, to see if this is going to be a long term thing."
"You read a play like this, you just do it. You drop everything and just do it," says Lithgow. Of Alsop, he adds: "His contradictions are so fascinating and that's what you look for characters — dualities and secrets and compensations."

Yes, a Security Council resolution could be useful if it helps smooth the rough transition out of tyranny — not only in post-Assad Syria, but across the Arab world. But Washington has now spent months getting us here — handing the lead to the Europeans, who promptly put the Gulf Arabs in front (albeit, some say, while still pulling the strings). And “here,” now that the Arab League has unsurprisingly proved no match for Assad’s butchery, is back at the Security Council.

My partner's family background is Eastern European Jewish; mine is German Protestant.

The pension system felt it was a privacy issue. We pointed out that the public can't monitor such spending for fraud without tying pensions to people. And the reality is that pension fraud exists and it costs taxpayers money. We've reported on it.
There have been other county officials who also have served admirably, but Hagan's tenure is unique and, as it ends, those of us who worked as the county administrator under him simply want to say that we are proud to have done so.
Police Chief Bill Lee stepped down temporarily this week to try to cool the building anger that his department had not arrested Zimmerman. Hours later, Gov.

Agriculture panel Republicans are, at least for now, leaving alone billions of dollars a year in oft-criticized farm subsidies, including direct payments to farmers regardless of whether they produce a crop. Cuts to those programs are waiting for a subsequent farm bill.
Even if Tebow sells a few thousand PSLs, even if he gets the Jets the coveted Back Page every now and then in a town where the Super Bowl Giants reside, even if he is able to add toughness and leadership and class to a locker room sorely lacking them, was it worth bringing in a Wildcat quarterback/special teamer/jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none who will draw media crowds worthy of a rock star everywhere he walks (on water)? No.

Carrying a phone while mountain biking used to be a 50-50 proposition for Chat Marler, but now he won't hit the trail without one.
It is audacious for any nation, however big and mighty, to presume to reform and rearrange the character of another nation, particularly a far away and culturally alien one to suit its own ideals of the norm. The character of every ancient nation, like that of Afghanistan, is fired by centuries at the forge of history. When Americans bring their crude impatience and impossible expectations of democracy and freedom to that forge, disappointment is inevitable. We are defeated in Afghanistan, as we should be, for our arrogance and "bull in a china shop" attitude. This should be our lesson well-learned.

Coat this band with Tanglefoot, available at nurseries and home improvement stores. The ants can't cross this sticky substance. You will have to redo this process when the product is no longer sticky due to dust, water, etc.

We'll win because: Youth Never Dies takes the listener speeding through pop punk riffs, sliding through melodic breakdowns and crashing into a blast of heavy metal, delivering a unique sound appealing to many different genres of music. Guitarist Jim Scully and bassist Connor Peterson have participated in the Rock-Off the past two years, giving the band an edge in experience.

Use all your senses: Judging beer is a science, and Pat Daniels -- one of the most knowledgeable tasters around -- offers an excellent guide: bjcp.org/docs/How_to_Judge_Beer.pdf. "All five human senses can and should be used when judging officially or casually," says Daniels, a bartender at McNulty's Bier Markt. And yes, that includes hearing: "I know what you're thinking. How can one's ears contribute to the overall beer-tasting experience? When judging or casually drinking from beer poured from the bottle, I have started the process with many styles such as a highly carbonated Belgian Gueuze and Tripel that should present the sound of massive amounts of CO2 escaping from the bottle (like popping champagne) after being opened. Unfortunately, my ears are the first to detect that such a bottle has gone flat and lost this sought-after carbonation that helps makes the style."

Still, he contends, certain emotional styles make it harder to lead a meaningful, productive life. Which inspires both the bad news and the good news from the book. A person who is self-opaque in the self-awareness department, puzzled in the social intuition department and unfocused in the attention department will likely struggle at dinner parties. (Bad news.)

If there is a connection between the timing of Mr. Johnson's arrest and the investigation into Mr. Nicholson, that's a real problem. Police have long focused on Mr. Johnson in the Barnes case, but they had not moved forward with an arrest, despite strong public pressure to do so. It would be terrible if, after all these months, authorities took action without having all the evidence they will eventually need.

The same day, Diamond tweeted a picture of 42-year-old McNeil and wrote, "I'd like you to meet Katie. I'm lovestruck. I took this photo in London last month. Neil."
What makes fear of "Brokeback" even more odd are the misconceptions that have developed among those who haven't seen the film. On top of being the favorite movie of the year of many critics, Ang Lee's film has mistakenly received a reputation as some kind of nonstop guy-on-guy sex romp.

By this time, you should have worked up an appetite for lunch, which awaits a few minutes south of Point Lobos. While the marathoners might nibble on a piece of fruit (local strawberries if they're lucky) or suck down an energy gel at the aid station near mile 21, more substantial fare awaits those who head uphill to California Market in the Hyatt Carmel Highlands. Generally known as the Highlands Inn, the luxury hotel has added "Overlooking Big Sur Coast" to its name; the panorama of Yankee Point from the casual restaurant, which also sits above the resort's swimming pool, helps justify the high prices for the eclectic breakfast and lunch menu (burgers and crab dishes among our favorites.)

Behind Ireland stands Portugal, one of the eurozone's smaller members with 1.8 percent of its economy but one that is considered by some to have done less than the Irish to bring debt and deficits back under control. Next comes Spain, with a proportionally smaller debt burden but a dead-in-the-water economy that is so big --
McCoy, who worked as an assistant to the novelist Theodore Dreiser in her Manhattan days (a relationship that continued when he too moved to California), also wrote fiction throughout her long career, selling short stories to the New Yorker, Harper's Bazaar and other magazines.

Some of the changes you'll see in these pages include -- in addition to our traditional Restaurant of the Year and our Rising Star -- the Comeback of the Year, for a space and a chef that really deserve it. We've also changed the way we selected everything, from start to finish. (Read more about how we chose Restaurant of the Year in our review of Castagna.) And we've let some of our -- and your -- more everyday dining favorites in: chains, mom & pop shops, tried-and-true Portland establishments. We've also done away with each restaurant's hours and days, because those tend to change and we don't want to lead you astray. We hope each restaurant's phone number and website will keep you more up-to-date. And, of course, we've provided those.
Q: What are some moments that stand out in your mind?
So, let me propose one paradigm-shifting idea: What if we, the Columbia Basin, created the conditions for watershed communities to be the main economic beneficiaries from salmon recovery? Each sub-basin and the political jurisdictions that make it up could be shareholders in watershed trusts. These trusts would grow (or not) depending on the number and quality of salmon and salmon-enhancing habitat improvements they produced and maintained over time.

If Facebook's plans pan out, it could change the way people think of social networking.

The Chinese central bank last week did send a signal that currency traders read as an indication it might begin allowing the yuan to rise in value sometime in the future. American manufacturers contend the yuan is undervalued by as much as 40 percent and they blame the weak Chinese currency as a primary reason for America's huge trade deficit with China. A weak yuan makes Chinese goods cheaper in the U.S. and American goods more expensive in China.
Louis Vuitton set up shop on the rue Neuve des Capucines in 1854, describing himself as a "packager," with the tagline "Specialty in the Packing of Fashions." In 1896, George Vuitton, Louis' son, created the LV logo and monogram by which the company is now globally identified. Pamela Golbin, curator of the Les Arts Décoratifs exhibition (www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr; until Sept. 16), draws a comparison between Jacobs and Charles Frederick Worth, who, as the world's first couturier, created and established a whole new way of dressing for the emerging bourgeoisie. "Two innovators, both rooted in their respective centuries, advanced an entire industry," she says. "Two creators each in his own language appropriated cultural codes and trends in order to shape the history of contemporary fashion." This, in turn, informed Vuitton's methods and insured his success in creating luggage for this new customer, who could need as many as 10 trunks to transport everything from nightwear to evening gowns and shooting kit.

Now that I have, it's clear that the small spot adds a fresh -- and needed -- element to the neighborhood. Large, angled windows dominate the restaurant's facade, which help to brighten the otherwise dark dining room. Shades of slate gray and black create the sleek space that also has a meditative, bust-out-your-yoga-mat feel. In fact, most servers appear to be in a very Zen place. Our two servers over three visits were knowledgeable, but also laid-back to the point of seeming almost comatose.

Safety T.J. McDonald and tackle George Uko were defensive standouts Thursday. ... Kiffin, when asked about the Trojans' defense being ahead of the offense so far, said, "I think the gap's closing." Then he paused for a moment and said, "I just used that term. Never used that. The gap closed."

If you feel faint, cross your legs and tense your leg, abdominal and buttock muscles when warning symptoms first appear. The resulting blood pressure boost may stave off the faint or at least give you time to get to a safe place. Intense hand-gripping and tensing of the arm muscles can also help. If possible, lie down, ideally with your legs elevated, before you fall down. These simple measures can help keep you from adding the insult of injury to the discomfort of feeling faint.

I'm probably more of an amateur urban archaeologist than anything. I've always loved maps too, and I regularly post historic maps. It's neat to discover, for instance, that an old building is rounded on one corner because a long-gone railroad or streetcar track made a wide turn at that intersection.

That move blocked any other potential substitute motions by Councilmen Ash Kalra, Kansan Chu and Don Rocha, all of whom suggested alternatives during the three-hour meeting. Kalra and Chu ultimately joined Xavier Campos in opposing the measure. But Rocha, a swing vote, noted the effectiveness of the parliamentary maneuver as he sought in vain to modify the measure and realized his only option was begging Constant to allow "friendly amendments." Constant's reply: "No," "Hell no," and "I'm not entertaining any friendly amendments."
