I attended an off-the-record dinner with Rove before his speech. In both venues, he took prickly pleasure in not just disagreeing with liberals, but ridiculing them.

The line of reasoning that voters might prefer competence to likability got a boost from, of all people, former White House chief-of-staff Bill Daley, though he obviously didn't mean to.

That's just a fact of life."

Physical and hormonal changes, alone or coupled with life stressors, can precipitate the depression, Johnson said. For that reason, educating a woman early on about her reproductive life is important in the treatment of depression. But instead of focusing on changes in appetite, sleep and energy levels -- changes that often signal depression but that are hard to gauge in pregnant women and those who have just recently had babies -- physicians instead use another tool.

Before Piccino opened, few people, other than the area's residents, knew the Dogpatch neighborhood. Last year, owners Sher Rogat and Margherita Stewart Sagan moved the restaurant into much larger quarters in an old Victorian. They also lured MAC clothing into an adjoining space, developed a wine bar-shop called Dig, and opened Piccino coffee bar. The restaurant has become a destination for the Cal-Ital food produced by Rachel Sillcocks. Pizza, with a thin, golden and crisp crust, is at the heart of the menu, but Sillcocks creates some exceptional appetizers, salads, soups and a single large plate a night. Thanks to Piccino, Dogpatch is now on the culinary map.

American embassy officials in Beijing didn't exactly throw out the welcome mat when one of China's leading human rights activists showed up on their doorstep last week seeking refuge.

TriMet told Acker it was contemplating taking the house under eminent domain, which allows public entities to buy private property for public use even if the seller is unwilling.

Aramis Ramirez's one-out single and Corey Hart's laser-beam double off the left-center-field wall put runners at second and third for the Brewers. Lohse retired Mat Gamel on a short fly ball to right field. Ramirez, heeding Carlos Beltran's 100-plus career assists, bluffed a run home but stopped. Correctly so, as Beltran made a perfect one-hop peg to Yadier Molina.
Even on those nights, assuming no tantalizing leftovers await, I still don't want something out of a can or the freezer. That's when a quick pasta dish is king. If someone has made it for you, bonus.

Those tax credit programs are entitlements. They are paid each year, and they grow most years with no legislative oversight. The corporations and developers who own most of the credits - which reduce the amount of tax revenue the state otherwise would collect - receive the tax benefit upon redemption, no matter the state's economic situation.

"The only way you do it, even with the Rangers, you've got to earn it. (Rangers GM) Glen Sather has done a wonderful job building them. We've got a ways to go, no question. But we're in a position now where our club expects to go into games to get points, not just find a way to get points, but expect to get points. That's a pretty good feeling."
“It’s really very thin, but you don’t need a lot,” Kruger said. “The thinnest of layers will act as lubricant and allow you to slide. If you go down to incredibly low temperatures, ice isn’t going to be particularly slippery.”
So the Colts' motivation was presumably that Goodell advised them to do it to save him from having to set a precedent. Well, the precedent of retroactive justice on a whim is set, and it has Goodell's blacksmith touch all over it.

Naperville's Chris Derrick thrust himself into contention for an Olympic spot in the 10,000 meters by setting a U.S. collegiate record for the distance Sunday night at the Payton Jordan Invitational in Palo Alto, Calif.
Musically, the concert was most compelling during Beethoven’s Symphony No. 4, also under Wroe, who led an impassioned, fluid and sculpted interpretation. Booming chords vividly contrasted breezy winds and soft, jaunty slides, and emphatic passages vied excitingly against rhapsodic ones, punch against politesse.
CLEVELAND -- Prosecutors and defense attorneys are sparring over whether father-and-son suspects in beard- and hair-cutting attacks against fellow Amish are a threat to the community and should remain in jail pending trial.

Wieland stood by his cubicle in the back corner of the visiting clubhouse, fielding questions like a man who had just climbed out of a roller coaster. He was thrilled, overwhelmed, slightly disappointed, but far from dismayed. Having survived the evening's sensory overload, Wieland expects to pitch more persuasively Thursday night against the Philadelphia Phillies.
What taking such a step probably does mean, though, is that you recognize our obligation to other creatures is not merely a function of convenience and proximity, and that "I'd rather not know" is a sorry slogan for an engaged consumer.
Because the court bars live television or radio broadcasts from its building across from the U.S. Capitol, few regular Americans get to observe its pageantry and traditions. Even fewer get in for history-making arguments like this week's over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, because many of the 400-or-so seats in the courtroom are taken by lawyers, politicians, new media and personal guests of the court.
Authorities say Lee has no formal training and not enough space for his wards, only two of whom are not handicapped; they were left by single mothers. Lee has no license, but for years he had operated underneath the radar. Now he worries he will lose the government funds he receives as the children's legal guardian; the money keeps him in operation, along with donations from local firms and private benefactors.
The main Christmas markets in Bratislava are in beautiful public squares around the city. You'll find handmade pottery and wooden decorations often in the design of fish. That's because carp is a traditional dish during Slovak Christmastime.
By the time Warren Buffett yielded full control of the company in 2015 at the age of 85 years old, ensuring his full benefits under the new Social Security Reform Act-mandated retirement age, Berkshire and its value-investing credo had been lapped by a fully automated marketplace.
In perhaps the most widely anticipated move and perhaps the most important, Jeremy Deering will be moving back to WR after a year at RB. He has Sanu-like athleticism and while he may not start, the staff will need to get him involved in this year’s offense.

Ashley Wooldridge plans to study exercise science and physical therapy.
Later, she turns outright cynical. "It isn't easy to stay in love/if you can't tell lies," she sings in "Say Goodbye," But her most delicious expression of emotion comes in the lovely "Miriam," which addresses the other woman, who, it seems, may be a friend. "Miriam/it's such a pretty name/and I'll keep saying it until the day you die," Jones sings with chilling relish.
So it goes with the ML350 and its diesel counterpart, the BlueTec.
What does this mean for a) the likelihood of forever-on-the-bubble "Community" getting renewed for another season? b) Chase continuing with the show? or c) NBC's ongoing heartburn? We'll see.

All true, and it's also worth noting that the Colorado and Minnesota caucuses attracted about 65,000 and 50,000 voters, respectively, in states where general-election turnout reaches millions. In short, not many people voted Tuesday, and no convention delegates were chosen.
Or doesn’t start, in this particular case.

"A couple years ago I was scouting a Toronto game against the Nets," Greer said. "(Former Nets coach) Lawrence Frank ran that play ... and Vince Carter had a dunk to win the game. I thought it was a great play. And what happens as an advance scout is, and everyone does it, you say, 'Hey, that was a great play,' and you write it down. So I put it in my notes."

The fact that children can do toxic things to relationships is not a news flash. Diapers! Feedings! Strollers! No sleep! No sex! The endless loop has played out extensively in movies, and if that's all Jennifer Westfeldt was interested in exploring, "Friends With Kids" would be a tedious enterprise.

EFX pulled off the special effects when this morning Manning said to Elway he would be growing up from a colt to a Bronco. In 1983 Elway refused to play for the old Baltimore Colts, and wound up with the Broncos. In 2012 Manning is released by the Colts, and will wind up up with the Broncos. Weird world.

If you tried kayaking and enjoy it, you might even decide that, like a bicycle, it's nice to have more than one -- for instance, a sea kayak for covering ground and a sit-on-top for fishing, or maybe a small recreational boat that's light and ideal for inland lakes.
Hey, Jeff: Second to Detroit.
We weren't expecting many options in Naples, so we again stocked up on prepared vegetarian and vegan dishes at the local Whole Foods. But to our pleasant surprise, we found some notable options. Food & Thought Farm Market & Café (2132 Tamiami Trail, [239] 213-2222; http://www.foodandthought.com) brought us back several times during our visit for flavorful prepared and takeout dishes, organic coffees, smoothies and vegan desserts for breakfast and lunch. It offers both a market and cafe with outdoor patio seating under pleasant trees. Plus, the fruits and vegetables are picked daily from Food & Thought's own certified organic farm.
So it is no surprise that chef Jose Garces, on a scouting mission to Spain to create a menu for his Old City tapas room, Amada, came back stuck on the country's northern precincts: "If you live in San Sebastian," he says dreamily, "you can see the mountains and ocean at the same time."

Rather, the case broke open after federal agents followed up on tips from business associates of the accused conspirators.
Banna could have a future in public relations. He also landed a spot on a local TV morning show, along with some radio appearances. He and Esquivel also utilized their Facebook pages to seek votes. The whole thing paid off, with the two winning after more than 44,000 votes were cast.
Detectives from the prosecutor’s office circulated handouts asking anyone with information to call police.
Not this time, a night when Boyd Gordon laid down in front of the hard-shooting Shea Weber on a power play, a supreme act of valor. Tippett said his team "had no weak links," and that's how we once felt about our nemesis in Detroit, when the Red Wings would come at their opponent in waves, line after line, shift after shift.
According to the complaint filed by the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, Rodriguez and Hamilton conspired to sell heroin to an undercover law enforcement officer.

I would like to offer another viewpoint about the April 26 commentary about the television show "Mad Men" ("Thank goodness that era is over"). My first jobs were in advertising, just out of college in the early 1970s. The "times they were a-changin'," but my Minneapolis-based experiences in ad agencies were similar to the TV show. I look back rather fondly on those days. The office used to be fun. I was a young woman surrounded by creative, artistic people who lead interesting lives. We worked long hours, and we deserved the perks. Now things are more dreary and serious. One can be sued for telling a joke; you can't compliment a coworker on a nice outfit -- no wonder young people don't even bother to greet their coworkers in the morning.
Howard County is preparing for the county's $200 million bond sale Tuesday, buoyed by a AAA credit rating the county just earned from all three major bond rating agencies.

"He's really a bisexual American, but it didn't have the same panache," said the writer, Elizabeth Stone, according to a report in The Star-Ledger of Newark yesterday.
The Market District is a showcase for what New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman calls the "artisan economy" -- self-starters who "bring something extra to their jobs." These entrepreneurs tend to thrive around like-minded go-getters who may complement or even compete with their work. You see it in Ohio City, in the Gordon Square Arts District, along Waterloo Road in Collinwood and in Tyler Village, the massive, old elevator factory just east of downtown that's filling up with tech companies, artists, a couple of charter schools and, yes, a microbrewery.
COLUMBUS, Ohio - While local governments across Ohio consider layoffs and other ways to cope with recent state budget cuts, Ohio Senate leaders have handed out sizable pay raises with bonus checks to several staffers.

Republicans have not formally advocated the packing strategy, saying only that the new map should take demographic shifts into account. But Democrats and some other Hispanic groups say it’s clearly the GOP’s intention.
New Orleans prosecutors have dropped criminal charges against two protesters who were arrested after they refused to leave a Catholic church closed by the archdiocese.
"Winning over surrogates will help carry them," Jones said about the importance of securing endorsements within the party leadership. He said race also matters in such battles because only two minorities hold non-judicial countywide offices.

On Friday, government workers went to Woodby's home and gave her a plastic bag called "Lead-Safe Living." It had pamphlets on nutrition, lead-poisoning and what can be done about it. She is planning to fill her yard with 3 inches of new topsoil in an attempt to provide a buffer to her children.
The occasion was not altogether somber. Annemarie Conroy, the city's director of emergency services, quoted Jack London: "San Francisco is gone. There is nothing left but memories."
River City Extension, another excellent New Jersey folk-rock band, is on at Lambert's shortly after the Front Bottoms finish, but I want to make sure I catch Westfield's Static Jacks. I played "If You're Young," the band's debut album, scores of times last year, but I've never seen the group in action. Lambert's had a short line; at Red 7, a club right in the heart of the action, festivalgoers are queued up around the block to get in. For the week, Sony has taken over the club, and Say Anything are scheduled to play at ten. That must be what this line is for, right? Nope, turns out that television personality Carson Daly is hosting a showcase in the Red 7 courtyard. It's beautiful weather out there; inside the club, it's hot as a Texas July. The Static Jacks don't mind at all -- they start out frenetic and just get more intense from there. On record, the Jacks come off as a cross between the "angular" school of British rock like Maximo Park and the Futureheads and gleeful, fist-pumping North Jersey singalong pop-punk a la Steel Train. In concert, they obliterate the distinction between the styles: their punk is groovy, and their rock is barbed. They coax more than a few listeners in from the patio as they play -- those willing to brave the heat to hear a superb young combo on the rise. Like the Front Bottoms, they might not come away from SXSW with the coveted buzz, but they've definitely made some new fans.
Obama also made a broader case against his conservative Republican antagonists by challenging them on a matter dear to them: stopping overreach by the courts.
A small, relatively new family-owned winery in the Livermore Valley has won a very important award in the wine world.
It's not only the sandwich meat but the cheese and, surprisingly, even the bread that is loaded with it. There are at least 1,200 milligrams worth in a typical Subway sandwich, and that's without add-ons like olives, pickles and dressing.
At 7 tonight, the feature is "Nothing but the Truth," a South African drama in which the funeral of an anti-apartheid activist opens old wounds.
Some countries -- and Israel is one of them -- have mandatory insurance requirements. Those should have been noted when you made your reservation through Expedia. I checked the site after bringing your case to the company's attention, and the insurance requirements are not disclosed until you click on the fine print, under "certain conditional charges."
The rationale for keeping the rate low is stronger today than it was in 2007, considering the alarmingly rapid increase in college tuition. But with student loan debt at historic highs, the availability of cheap loans may be a double-edged sword: It helps families cope with fast-rising college fees, but it encourages students to take on more debt.
Roig-Franzia writes: Whether Rubio intended to mislead voters or simply never investigated the circumstances of his family's arrival is a question only he can answer. What is clear is that during his rise he placed great emphasis on his family's narrative, and he was eager to identify himself as the son of exiles.

U.S. officials spoke to Chen, 40, by phone Thursday and met with his wife, Yuan Weijing, at a location near the hospital, the senior official said.
The conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, of all people, recently concluded that Barack Obama had both a first-class intellect and a first-class temperament. The next president will badly need both.
"Admittedly, it will be difficult with him in the White House," McConnell said. "But if we can put a full repeal on his desk and replace it with the kind of commonsense forms that we were advocating during the debate to reduce spending, we owe it to the American people to do that."
In contrast, of the six fastest-shrinking counties listed in a Plain Dealer tabulation, Strickland carried four -- Cuyahoga, Mahoning (Youngstown), Trumbull (Warren) and Jefferson (Steubenville). The others were Hamilton and Crawford (Bucyrus). As noted, Hamilton, politically, is a world all its own -- a fact for which the rest of Ohio can be thankful. Crawford, like its best-known politico, Republican Supreme Court Justice Paul Pfeifer, is often a maverick.
"There was a guy we targeted that we had a lot of interest in," Buccaneers GM Mark Dominik said. "For a couple reasons we made that trade for Doug Martin. No. 1 who he is, a great team leader at Boise State … a productive football player. We felt like we wanted to get a back in this year's draft and felt he was a complete back. To do that, what happens also is you … end up with a five-year deal on a first-year pick's contract, which is important to me because that is extra value you get that isn't always seen."
I attended a TrackTown Tuesday event in Eugene earlier this month. The turnout swamped the establishment in which it was held. There were several hundred people there, all passionate about the sport. But you could count on one hand the fans who weren't Baby Boomers or members of the Greatest Generation.
In response, Jackson appointed a special commission that spent four months preparing an exhaustive, 900-page report that included 26 recommendations to improve police effectiveness and credibility in investigating missing-persons and sex-crimes cases.
But Suggs' leadership also surfaces in different ways. In many respects, he provides an important counterweight to Lewis, the man generally recognized as both the Ravens' brain and heart. Lewis is so driven and focused, and he gives so many thunderous sermons, he can't help but occasionally come across as too serious and dour. He's the Lion King of the Baltimore locker room, and you never forget it.
"I PR'd today in the shot, so I was happy with that," said Walker, who topped the second place finisher in the discus by 13 feet. "It's only our third meet, but I still thought the discus could have been better. … Our team had a great day."

Acton said at most the freeholder would ask for $1 million, but she said she felt a more realistic number would be $500,000 to $600,000.
"He was dead," Falby says. "His disability killed him. They couldn't refute it that last time."
To succeed against as big and physical an opponent as the Predators, the Wings need Franzen to play with fire. It's a rare player who performs at a consistently high level all season (his name: Nicklas Lidstrom), but Franzen is one of those guys who can be frustrating to watch when he doesn't use his size to bulldoze opponents and drive to the net. He does do that this time of year, though, and that's encouraging for the Wings' chances of success.
Ananouko, who said middle school peer pressure led to fights and trouble, joined a community garden as a high school freshman with his dad's encouragement. His skills, learned in Africa, impressed others, and he started teaching at the garden.

rivalry with teeth. It may not be a fun topic for TLR or Dusty, but it's great theatre for media and fans. As columnist B. Miklasz suggests, Cards-Cubs is a drinking game. Cards-Reds is becoming blood on the floor. As for AP, opponents are determined to challenge him inside until he proves he can still hurt them there. Coco Cordero's 0-2 pitch that hit AP Sunday afternoon was more an illustration of where teams now go against Albert than an intentional knockdown. Some noted as early as spring training that AP's bat speed appeared off. His recent power drag has done nothing

It also means securing adequate water supplies through such projects as desalinization and, yes, building more reservoirs, something TR wasn't averse to doing.
I had checked the dates and names in Esad's account, and his memory matched reality. But when it came to the core of the story, I trusted my instincts to tell me whether his highly personal account was true.

6. Starsky & Hutch (2004): Seemed like fun, with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson (then on hot streaks) pairing up to riff on the old '70s cop drama. But the two never decided if it was all a gag or if some of it was serious. A waste of time, though Snoop Dog as Huggie Bear was a nice bit.

It was also one of the first ships outfitted to carry a drone for reconnaissance flights.

Ironically, perhaps, Congress' gridlock may lead to the biggest one-time deficit-reduction package in memory. Unless Congress acts by Dec. 31, a host of tax hikes — including taxes on income, payroll and capital gains — will hit millions of Americans in 2013.

In response to The Rev. Brian W. Harrison's argument (of 4/3/2011) that same-sex marriage must not be a human right since it has "remained unknown to the entire human race from the dawn of civilization until just a few years ago."

This implies that at least some members of the human race were interested in exercising their human right to same-sex marriage even then.

However, choosing not to marry does not mean reconciling life in isolation. The harm, I think, comes when we, as men and women, misinterpret the value of a marital relationship. We put marriage on a pedestal and assume that no other relationship will be as enduring and, what's more, as fulfilling as any other we will have. But this is simply not the case. Any of my close friends can tell you that I value friendships much the same as I value family. Why? Because these are the people I connect with; they invest in me as I do in them. Loneliness happens, I believe, when we allow ourselves to remain isolated. But we have choices. We are daily surrounded by opportunities for growing in our relationships: it's just a matter of being intentional and acting on them.

-- A rule giving homeowners a single contact person to handle the confusing, paper-heavy search for a new loan. The bill adds legal grounds to sue over "robosigning" or paperwork incorrectly done. Bankers say the law invites lawsuit abuse and will further dry up loan funds.

We cooked five turkeys last year. Every year I roast a turducken, which — colossal meat-fest that it is (picture a chicken stuffed inside of a duck stuffed inside of a turkey) — was just enough to feed our group for the first couple of years. Eventually, I added a barbecued turkey, smoked outside on the Weber . (I learned quickly that you have to be creative when you're hosting these large gatherings. We have a small kitchen and only one oven. As the gathering moved outside, so did a lot of my cooking.)

Yardbirds alums Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page or Jeff Beck weren’t onstage when the 21st-century version of the legendary blues-rock powerhouse band played at Tangier in Akron in 2010. But the band was more than just a nostalgia act. As founding members of the English supergroup, drummer Jim McCarty and rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja earned the right to tour as the Yardbirds.
The budget line item said placing the Space Shuttle Atlantis in the Air Force museum "would be a historic reminder of the USAF contributions in space."
The quest to form a solid offensive front from left to right seemingly is endless. After doling out big bucks in free agency in 2009 to veterans Floyd Womack and John St. Clair, the Browns made two more additions this year. They signed ex-Raven Tony Pashos in free agency and drafted Arizona State's Shawn Lauvao in the third round. Pashos was signed to start at right tackle. Lauvao will compete with Womack to start at right guard. Left guard Eric Steinbach, one of a handful of NFL starting offensive linemen under 300 pounds and thought to be a potential casualty because of a $5.75 million salary, would appear to be safe another year. The absence of a salary cap certainly helps Steinbach.
Prosecutors said Phil Nunes of the Oriana House, another community correctional program, was among others at the lunch.
"I perked right up when she introduced herself, because not only did I grow up close to the Brandywine Valley and river, but her name in German, 'brandwein,' means distilled spirits," said Neyah, who grew up on a farm in rural Chestertown, Md., the oldest of seven, and whose name also garners interest (his parents made it up).

I enjoyed for once watching the weather woes across the nation as an observer, not a participant. Friends struggled with the winter storms in snowbound Boston, while a colleague who had planned a romantic getaway with his girlfriend to Paris endured one of the coldest weeks in years as the French capital shivered in the teens at night. In the past, I've spent this week freezing on a stalled train in Chicago or sitting on a tarmac in Atlanta for four hours waiting for a plane to get de-iced. This year, I sat on my porch and watched the rain or took walks when the sun came out.
This is, said Jami Counter, a senior director of SeatGuru, "one more revenue stream."
I dare not mention any of these current restaurants by name, however, at the risk of leaving somebody's favorite out of the mix. Customers have their loyalties, and I don't want to start a food war here.

"I had thought about it for a full year," she says, "and I was really back and forth. But at the end of last season. I was feeling really tired.

The city’s goals, after all, are to spend a reasonable amount of money on emergency medical responses while providing timely, high quality care that saves the most lives possible. The standard set by the council and the figures collected by the department need to help the public get answers on how well the city is meeting those key goals.

Rogers has readied a 1992 Dodge Caravan for this year's fair that looks much more striking than it did in the showroom. Renamed the Joker Express, the minivan is metallic purple with a no-Batman logo on its hood. The story is it used to be a Gotham City police cruiser before the arch villain hijacked it. The police light bar Rogers installed on its roof flashes. Its siren roars.

"Reading Between the Wines" (UC Press, 189 pages, $24.95): Importer Terry Theise's long-awaited memoir might contain the year's most literate wine writing. Theise, well-known for his lyrical wordsmithing, avoids the usual memoir take and instead pens a rhapsody to the wines he loves, and to the very beauty of wine itself. If that lyricism is occasionally laid on thick (which should be familiar to those who've read his catalogs), it doesn't diminish the strength of Theise's sentiments.
"Instead of getting to the space for those conversations, we have had to swallow a portable taking up space," she said. "But I want to be really clear I am not criticizing the district, because I don't know what else they would do."
The festival is a way of celebrating the rural history and pleasant village atmosphere of Fair Oaks, said Robert Locke, a Realtor with Coldwell Banker. “Some people like the chickens, others don’t, but they are a unique aspect of the rural downtown area,” he said. “People also are attracted to Fair Oaks because of the uniqueness of the rolling hills, the oak trees, the sense of feeling that it’s a tight-knit community and the sense of pride of fellow Fair Oakians. It’s a good, family-oriented community with its amphitheater, parks and concerts.”

Q: When do those featured in The Oregonian receive their wishes?
øUsing a number of weapons including automatic machine guns and a katana sword, this third-person game has you shooting and slashing increasingly weird demons, solving a few environmental puzzles and unlocking new areas to continue the fight. Not only is Boltzmann unable to die, he can still survive without his head - er, unless it's eaten. While clearly campy, this game mechanic doesn't work well because just as you're frantically trying to regroup your body parts you're torn apart again by the vicious demons. This makes for a frustrating experience.

Like Ameren, Exelon Corp. - with 10 plants and 17 reactors in Illinois and two other states - believes that used fuel can be safely stored in either the pools or dry casks, spokeswoman Krista Lopykinski said. The Chicago-based company, the nation's largest nuclear operator, said the acceleration of dry cask storage doesn't significantly reduce the used fuel pool heat load, which is largely determined by the most recent fuel discharged from the reactor.
Acting Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn Murray says 34-year-old Lee Moir of Toronto, Ontario, posed as the pop star on Facebook. Authorities allege he threatened to harm the girl's family to force her to perform sex acts online.

While there are no easy Hollywood sales jobs, hawking "Act of Valor" has been particularly tricky, requiring Relativity to organize a three-pronged campaign: first to explain the film's concept, then spell out its story and finally tout its action.

Pete Garcia, an aviation consultant and former Continental vice president, said he was surprised there weren't more. A possible explanation, Garcia said: Alioto's legal team didn't frame its request precisely enough to get what it wanted.
The killer who is so vicious that he can't let a single slight from his playing days go without retribution in speech or act has overseen some of the biggest messes in basketball. Start with his ugly management roles with the Wizards, his draft selections of losers such as Kwame Brown and his bad coaching choices. And now his neglect of an entire franchise likely has become the bottom of the abyss.
The place was packed. But few, if any, of the restaurant patrons seemed to have any idea of what was happening, why there was a television truck parked outside, or why dinner was being interrupted.

If I'm the Browns, I don't even look at his six-TD performance against Detroit. They shouldn't let Green Bay's sterling supporting cast and coaching influence their evaluation of Flynn. Heckert has to have a "book" on Flynn based on his evaluation coming out of LSU in 2008. It so happens that the Philadelphia Eagles had a largely unproductive draft in 2008 with Heckert supervising it. They had taken Kevin Kolb in the second round the year before, so they weren't exactly scouting quarterbacks. But the only quality player they drafted in 10 picks was DeSean Jackson in the second round.
Authorities say the cocaine had an estimated value of $180,000 while methamphetamine was worth about $200,000.
If offered a job, workers should consult the nation's consulate or embassy to take care of any legalities involved, such as securing a work visa. In most cases, the company offering the position will advise the employee on how to get permits or will handle all the arrangements.

Cuyahoga County continues to apply for, and get, HUD grants to remove lead paint and other hazardous materials from houses. The CDC money helps subsidize the cost of the blood tests and analysis offered to children at county health clinics and group screenings in the community, and the case management that kicks in for children and families once a child is diagnosed with lead poisoning.
Remember Tom Wolfe's nutty 1975 rant, "The Painted Word," a slim volume claiming that theory had knocked visual experience to the ground and held it down for the count? One could even say that graffiti owes its 1980s emergence into art world consciousness to the success of Conceptual art's frontal assault on formalist Modernism, with its crabbed notion that, say, a painting's highest purpose is to define what a painting is. With an emphasis on words, some Conceptual art even opened the door to thinking of tagging as an artistic strategy.

Theres a lot about Tom Izzo that we do know because it gets repeated ad nauseum at this time of the year. Yes, we know that he occasionally runs the famous war drill where the players wear football pads. Yes, we know that he and Steve Mariucci are best of friends dating back to their time growing up together in Iron Mountain, and yes, we know that hes brilliant in March, particularly in the second game of any weekend, in which he has put together a gaudy 17-3 record in those scenarios.

As Eberstadt is careful to note, demographics is not necessarily destiny. You can have fast economic development with low fertility or high fertility (South Korea and Taiwan did it a few decades ago).

That's a risk campaigns in Iowa are willing to take, given the high stakes and state of the race ahead of Tuesday's caucuses that kick off the fight for the GOP nomination.
A: For fresh berries, make sure that they are firm, with no soft spots. Generally, the darker the berry, the "sweeter" it is -- if you can call a cranberry "sweet." Oregon cranberries also have a longer growing season than East Coast cranberries, making them larger, darker and riper when harvested. Oh -- and if you bite into a cranberry and the seeds are brown, it's ripe.

Goldman believes Unigo fills this need, especially when you consider that many high schools have only one college guidance counselor for every 400 students. In California and other states, the ratio is one counselor per 1,000 students, he said.

Hey, Dan: More than ever, I'm of the opinion the Browns need a bigger, stronger quarterback to compete in their brutal division. Yes, everyone scoffs at Derek Anderson, with good reason. But the fact is they won 10 games when he was flinging the ball to Braylon Edwards and Kellen Winslow. No, I don't want Anderson back. But the Browns need to think big at the quarterback position. The key, of course, is to find a bigger quarterback with a strong arm and many of the same intangibles as McCoy.

Contrasting the careful work of the farmer with the random workings of the weather and wild creatures, "Planting the Wild Garden" by Kathryn O. Galbraith, illustrated by Wendy Anderson Halperin (Peachtree Publishers: $15.95, ages 4-8) shows how seeds make their way in the world. The wind scatters them, the rain washes them; they are carried by streams and animals — sometimes even by people.

A story like "Ruth," however, is predictive of Vonnegut's great future. His particular vision of human life — it's vulnerable, it's precarious, it's pained, and fate is likely to slap us hard at any moment — is already falling into place, as is that wry tone, which mingles wit and resignation with an unashamed moral gaze. Vonnegut was interested in simple yet profound investigations of right and wrong, even when seeking to peddle middlebrow magazine hackery.

The government’s case hinges on secret videos Dwek made of encounters with Elwell in May and July of 2009. Elwell’s attorney, Thomas Cammarata, asked this morning to have the jury told that Dwek was recently jailed after having his $10 million bail revoked, because he was arrested for a crime in Maryland. Cammarata argued it would show the jury that Dwek continues to be a troubled criminal and a societal problem. It would also show, he argued, that Dwek is not reformed and he does not deserve the benefits of having cooperated with the government. In addition, by painting a picture of Dwek as a man who allegedly continues to break the law, Cammarata indicated the jury may think more about the possibility that Dwek may not have cooperated with government to benefit society -- but rather to simply get a lighter sentence on his 2006 fraud conviction.

It's even more remarkable in 3-D.
Norm Krumholz, a former city planner for Cleveland, advocated "equity planning" to help poor residents. As a professor of urban studies at Cleveland State University, he found that, in the Central neighborhood, the original home for many immigrants and black migrants, the median family income was $4,280 in 1980.

Sixty-two percent of adults over 25 had not finished high school. Violent crime was the highest in the city. Twenty percent of the area's public housing was vacant.
