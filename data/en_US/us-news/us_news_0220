For some truckers, modernizing is less of a burden. Rather than buying a whole new truck, Valeriano Varela was able to refit his 1980 Freightliner day cab with a 1998, 500-horsepower, Detroit Diesel 60 Series engine — for $12,000.

And so — undertaking his quest for answers — Bissell spends much of the book interviewing members of the gaming community about the unstable alliance of stories and games. According to game designer Clint Hocking, the "very nature of drama, as we understand it, is authored," but after a player seizes control, "pacing and flow and rhythm — all these things that are important to maintaining the emotional impact of narrative — go all willy-nilly." In questioning where games fit into the artistic landscape, the sharpest commentators — Bissell included — reveal society's long-held assumptions about story, character, theme and authorship.

The classic was Dan Marino. When he came out of Pitt in 1983, there was talk he had a drug problem (which he didn't), that he wasn't football smart (which he was) and that he was injury-prone (which he wasn't). So one of the great passers in the history of the planet slipped to Miami (27th overall) at the end of the first round. Any skulduggery afoot? Five quarterbacks went in front of Marino.

This is a team long on size but short on athleticism, as the Lakers were unable to keep the Mavericks' J.J. Barea in front of them, much less Chris Paul.

But get on your feet, and the metabolic equation shifts. Standing burns 30 percent more calories than sitting -- more if you stand up and sit down several times in a row as a mini-exercise. The health payback can be huge if you take lots of breaks to get some water or tea, or pace in place when you're on the phone.

Mesa Mountain View boys basketball coach Gary Ernst told me that in the 1970s and 1980s, he might have to deal with an unhappy parent once a year, if that. These days, he said, it's more like once a week. What's transpired at Chaparral is illustrative of the sea change.

“That is something that we’ve gone back-and-forth with,” Canales said. “I felt that last game, we felt we could guard them with that lineup, and make them pay on the other end. We had a couple empty possessions, they did a great job of closing out the (first) half. They started the second half with that lineup, and it was working for them.

Only occasionally is it considered who the Browns didn't take. The value of 1976 picks Mike Pruitt (seventh) and Dave Logan (65th) shouldn't be diminished because they and no other team selected future Hall of Fame tackle Jackie Slater until the Los Angeles Rams took him 86th.

But it was not just law enforcement that was skeptical of Aitchison and his ilk. Many of the practicing artists in La Jolla, as well as their patrons, tended toward landscape or portrait painting. They had little use for the edgier tendencies of the Art Center's faculty or their beatnik-like appearance.
Indeed, coaches are criticized everywhere. It's part of the crazy, know-it-all fandom we live in. But in my seven years of covering McMillan, I have never sensed the anti-McMillan sentiment as strongly as this season, right now.

Islamic centers have become a focus of non-Muslim fears. Federal authorities have placed informants in mosques, saying doing so is a critical counter-terrorism tool. Muslim groups have separately created national campaigns encouraging congregations to monitor for any sign of radicalization, but they have also complained bitterly about the use of informants, worried the innocent will be caught up in the net police have set for criminals.

A March 20 psychiatric evaluation by Dr. Surendra Kelwala of Livonia concluded that Monroy had broken the glass on the cell door because he believed sheriff's deputies were plotting against him and planning to shoot his family.

Strange also created the arrangements for a guitar-driven big-band album Eddy recorded in 1967, "Roaring Twangies," that featured both of them wielding their instruments over a large ensemble of saxophones, trumpets and trombones. "He said it was one of his favorite projects because he did so much with the arrangements" of Glenn Miller hits and other songs mostly from the pre-rock era, said Eddy, who also wrote a song for and played with Sinatra, Hazlewood and Strange on their 2004 reunion album "Nancy & Lee 3," three years before Hazlewood died.

Sagili is 39, slender and reserved, but his affection for and fascination with bees streams forth in rapid paragraphs. A hive consists of a single queen, several hundred drones and 30,000 to 40,000 female workers. The drones' sole job is to mate with the queen, which they do in-flight, away from the hive, in a cloud of drones from multiple colonies. The queen mates with 10 to 20 drones in a one-time fling and stores their sperm for three to four years, laying up to 1,500 eggs a day at times. If there is no need to fertilize a queen, workers push out the freeloading drones.

It wasn't until after police found one of the suspected robbers, that Campbell found out one of her bullets pierced the would-be robber who was on the passenger's side of the car in the abdomen.
The idea of giving up something is common in most religions. Many Christians opt to sacrifice something for Lent -- which ended Saturday -- as a way to prepare for Easter, a form of penitence and a way to grow closer to God. Many Jewish people forgo unleavened bread products during Passover, which began Friday at sundown.

Many Wildwood developers were forced to abandon projects. Others brought in auction companies to try to reset the market and sell enough condos to stay ahead of foreclosure actions.
So here's good ol' Roger Waters singing "Gunner's Dream" with his solo act. Wise guys will say he never did anything but. Over the years, he's been called an irascible bastard -- sometimes by his former bandmates -- but his vision has always been a generous one. Me, I love "The Final Cut" because it's got the strengths of "The Wall" (a profound anti-war and anti-alienation message coupled with the nagging suspicion that we actually lost World War II) without any of its weaknesses (self-absorption, misogyny.) Also, I'll concede that it didn't have any hits. But he'd done hits; lots of 'em. By 1983, he was ready for something else. This is it.

The "skinny" silhouette was introduced about two years ago, much to the horror of women with wide hips. Now that people are comfortable with the style, adding a shock of color makes a familiar piece fresh -- and it gives shoppers reason to buy multiple pairs.

As of this week, it is somebody else's problem, of course. And if there are things to debate about his tenure with the Sixers, this is offered without challenge: Even after all of these years, tearing up a pretty good hockey team and rebuilding it in one summer is much more Ed Snider's style.
With socialists embracing May Day, the reaction by the western elites was just a matter of time. By the early 1920s, Americans were celebrating “Americanization Day” to extol the virtues of the United States while at the same time casting cold water on socialists as foreigners who were unfriendly to the values of hard work and freedom that made America unique.
Nothing else really clicked, either, starting with the bizarre guest-starring appearance of New York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony. He played the recovering athlete in rehab and, for this sports nut at least, was nothing but a distraction from what should have been a serious storyline.

"These guys have done better than the market -- in a very challenging environment."
"We didn't give people outlets when they got to the rim," said Lawson, who had four shots blocked. "They were up in the air and Bynum blocked it, but there was nobody to pass to. So we have to help each other by finding the open space and giving outlets to the players going to the basket."
Winters said the measure Lininger represented was rushed and designed to negate their citizen-led measure, if passed.

I spent a lot of time here talking about Windows Phone's basic design philosophy because it represents a unique approach to a mobile phone OS. And that's the central point in any argument about making the Nokia Lumia 900 -- or any other Windows Phone -- a top-tier choice.
There are, of course, a few fact claims in which conservative Protestant theology and science differ, such as the origins of humans and the universe. Here we find that typical conservative Protestants are likely to believe the teaching of their religion on the issue and not the scientific claim.

Romney said Tuesday: "Free enterprise has done more to lift people out of poverty, to help build a strong middle class, to help educate our kids and to make our lives better than all of the government programs put together. . . .

The rules for the new genre were quickly clear. First, the heroes/victims were comfortably off and intelligent; the villains/murderers were poor and uneducated. The lure of drugs or sex would tempt our heroes to do something stupid; their transgression would then be punished out of all proportion. Survival only came at the cost of sinking to the villains’ own animalistic level.

A lot of people still don't understand what this trial was all about. It wasn't set up to prove that Bonds took steroids. It wasn't set up to pop him for using steroids. The prosecution wanted to prove that Bonds lied to a grand jury about using steroids. It was about the lying. Not the juicing. And at the end of seven years and $55 million, federal prosecutors weren't able to make the lying allegations stick. It's remarkable, really.
The pairings: While some of the matches are adequate, there's not much excitement, and the price seems steep compared to other restaurants of this caliber. The 2003 Chateau la Gatte Bordeaux Blanc Sec took on a harsh note when paired with the frog leg soup. From there, the menu called for red wine. A 2001 Domaine Desertaux-Ferrand Ladoix was innocuous, but a 2002 Acorn Medley, Alegria Vineyards Russian River, a blend of 15 varietals, made a spectacular showing with the rich pig's feet, sweetbread and lobster terrine; and the 2001 Domaine Le Galantin Bandol, a Mouvedre blend, enhanced the rabbit.

Garcia has allowed one runner to reach second base safely since the end of the third inning, and he's coaxed two double plays to help keep his pitch count economical. Garcia completed six innings on 65 pitches. In the fifth inning, the Cubs' leadoff hitter, Geovany Soto, reached on a fielding error by shortstop Rafael Furcal. The next batter, Reed Johnson, hit a sharp one-hopper back at Furcal, and the Cardinals' shortstop coolly turned it into a double play.

In Memory of the Child-Woman, a bust of Tell is perched on a rock with holes suggesting the eyes and mouth of a mask. Below Tell's grinning face, the bust is feminized with breasts. References to his mother are written on the stone. Dali himself is represented by a tiny image of his Great Masturbator floating on a blue sea. In the foreground, a box holding timepieces is topped by a large key and in the background are glimpses of the rocky bay near his childhood home of Port Lligat. An androgynous couple embrace. The painting is crammed with recurring images, as are most of his paintings, recombined as a complex, even confusing and contradictory, exploration of his fears about emasculation, sex, desire and death. It was finished in 1932, three years after he posed for a photograph with his muse Gala, standing with a sea urchin balanced on his shaved head instead of the apple. (Sea urchins were his father's favorite food.) His father had recently banished him from the family, furious over his liaison with Gala, an older married woman, and paintings he considered outrageous affronts, so particular biographical references are easily made. But as with everything Dali, the images and symbols do not connect as a smooth narrative but as a series of questions Dali seems to pose to himself about who he is and wants to become.

Former FBI Agent Ali Soufan, who was present at the beginning of the infamous Abu Zubaydah interrogations and personally interrogated suspected terrorists, testified before a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, saying, “I strongly believe that it is a mistake to use what has become known as the ‘enhanced interrogation techniques.’” Professional operatives, he said, including CIA officers who were present at the initial phases of the Zubaydah interrogation, agreed with him. Soufan’s words are telling, especially in light of the harsh torture tactics used against Zubaydah that have still brought no conclusive evidence against him.

Other bills have generated controversy at the expense of votes. Same-sex marriage legislation seems unlikely to pass at this time, and another politically charged issue — changing the way New Jersey fills vacant U.S. Senate seats — was dropped after Democrats failed to agree on a way to ensure Christie would appoint a Democrat if either of the state’s current senators resigns.

The Democrats need to at least pass the bills out of committee before early July.

And the Legislature must pass the proposed amendment at least three months before the November election for it to make it onto the ballot.

In March, Christie proposed a set of changes he called "tools" to help school districts keep costs down. Executive county superintendents, appointed by the governor, would be required to approve all school district contracts, rejecting those that increase salaries more than a cap property taxes increases. The superintendent would also be directed to reject contracts without a minimum number of work days, and those that do not include a minimum of five hours of "pupil contact" for teachers.

makeup in place when the heat is on. It's a calming, cool spray that really does seem to do wonders on preserving makeup integrity. The No More Shine version also claims to reduce shine and brighten makeup color, and that's exactly what I notice after the mist absorbs into my skin. I notice the best results when I apply it twice - under makeup as a toner and then over makeup. The mist is also nice enough to use alone, so I use it on days when I'm makeup-free, too. I currently alternate between the No More Shine (for oilier skin) and Moisture Lock Makeup Finish (for drier skin), but I haven't really developed a preference. I know I've got drier skin, but I think the high humidity this time of year is a factor.
