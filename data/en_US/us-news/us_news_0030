Jeannine Stein: I'll start off by asking something that's on a lot of people's minds: Radioactive isotopes are headed toward California after being released from the nuclear plant in Japan. We've been told that there's nothing to worry about, that the radiation levels are very low and not potentially harmful. Still, many people are worried. From what you know about this, is there any cause for alarm at this point?

Moments later, Cook shimmied back to Gimenez, who was washing dishes.
I have had to balance local government budgets during a severe recession. In West Hollywood we successfully balanced the budget by going through programs one by one to eliminate waste and duplication, while preserving vital services. I also helped the city accumulate a budgetary surplus which has allowed West Hollywood to weather downturns without having to reduce services. In Los Angeles we can enact a hiring freeze and reduce the payroll through attrition and voluntary early retirements. City employee unions should be asked to come up with voluntary plans to help save money as well. City managers should take a temporary 10% pay reduction, and as council member I will lead by example in taking a 10% pay cut.
Though businesses that say they've cut spending in the past year still outweigh those who shelled out funds, recent expenditures are at a post-recession peak.

When this editorial board laid out its cornerstone principles for reform back in 2009, at the top of the list was universal participation -- what critics call a mandate. Requiring everyone to have coverage addresses the current inequality that forces people with insurance to pay the bills of those without. 'Health care is not a commodity, as some Issue 3 proponents maintain, that people can choose or not choose to use. Sooner or later, everyone needs medical attention. As health reforms continue to evolve, slamming doors at the state level is bad public policy.
“The jerseys were in already, but coach (John Dunne) said, ‘Do it next year, when you’re a senior,’ ” Hall said. “Every game last season I wore tape on my left wrist with ‘52’ on it. And when they’re stricter with that in the postseason and NCAA Tournament, I had it on my ankle tape.”
Reynolds, the Canadian actor who starred in “The Proposal” and will don tights and a mask for the presumptive blockbuster “The Green Lantern” next summer, is married to Scarlett Johansson (no slouch in the sexy department herself). “Now it's going to be, 'Sexiest man, take out the garbage.’ That does sound better,” Reynolds says.

This is a devastating portrait. At times, the U.S. health care system delivers the worst of both worlds: pay more, get less. Unfortunately, the message isn't new. America's fragmented and overspecialized health system maximizes returns to providers -- doctors, hospitals, drug companies -- but not to society. Fee-for-service reimbursement allows providers to reconcile their ethical duty (more care for patients) and economic self-interest (higher incomes). The more they do, the more they earn. Restraints are few, because patients and providers both resist limits on their choices. Government regulators and private insurers are too weak to control costs.
He points to that stretch to explain why he doesn't regret signing a long-term deal before the completion of what arguably was the finest offensive season of his career.

Coles is 31 and is no longer the burner he was coming out of Florida State in 2000. (He surely outlived his more heralded teammate, Peter Warrick, as a pro.)

The catechism of the Roman Catholic Church calls homosexual acts "acts of grave depravity" and "intrinsically disordered" because they "close the sexual act to the gift of life." In 2006, the U.S. bishops said that while the church teaches that homosexual acts are immoral, 'she does distinguish between engaging in homosexual acts and having a homosexual inclination. While the former is always objectively sinful, the latter is not."

The visual trickery and CGI technology that allowed a likeness of late rapper Tupac Shakur to appear onstage for two songs at the Coachella music festival took quickly to the Twitter trends.

This has made Pennsylvania's five-term Sen. Arlen Specter the archetypal figure for this year, a man who was literally run out of the Republican Party by the challenge of a junior former House member and the ill-financed Tea Party movement, and then upset in his new home in the Democratic primary by an even more unknown Joe Sestak, a stranger to most voters across the state until his ads began three weeks before Election Day.

Once the servant of industry, banking became our dominant industry. It has ceased to serve us. We serve it. And when it went all but belly up in the panic of 2008, the federal government bailed it out, on the assumption of those authoring the Troubled Assets Relief Program legislation that the banks would use those funds to bail out our larger society. Instead, they took the money and sat on it. Lending to small business in particular has not bounced back.
MORRISTOWN — A 12-year-old girl testified this morning that she saw her father “on top” of her mother in a bathtub in their Morristown home, “trying to grab her hands from her and scratching her” on the day he is accused of drowning her.
Tensions in the community had been running high before the riot, fueled in part by the case of a Korean grocer who shot to death a black teenager she had accused of trying to steal a bottle of orange juice.

Turns out that was just a taste of the drama to come for the Blazers (20-23), who fell to 1-4 on a seven-game trip that has been a disaster. The Blazers managed just 12 points and five field goals in the first quarter and trailed 55-29 at halftime. At that point, it was fair to wonder if the Blazers would finish with more turnovers than field goals, because they had 17 turnovers and 11 made shots. By the time the game mercifully ended, five Knicks had reached double figures in scoring -- including Smith (23 points), Steve Novak (20), Amare Stoudemire (17) and Carmelo Anthony (16) -- and they had outshot the Blazers 53.8 percent to 37.3. Really, New York dominated the Blazers in every statistical category.
1. HOLLIDAY SPENDING: The biggest development for the Cardinals in 2010 was also the biggest contract (so far) in Cardinals history. Matt Holliday agreed to a seven-year, $120-million contract last January that is the richest the franchise has ever completed. A big-money player for the first time in his career, Holliday then went out and had one of the best seasons of any outfielder in the NL. He's the first teammate to have a higher average than Pujols in Pujols' career, and Holliday won the Silver Slugger award. Holliday was the only outfielder in the NL to rank in the top 10 in average, on-best percentage and slugging. The year ends with Holliday making another move. Holliday, embracing the role as a franchise fixture, has brought his family north to call the St. Louis area home.

Woody Harrelson has a small, sour role as Jango, an ex-rocker turned organic-yogurt magnate. James Liao has more fun than you'd expect in the eventually preposterous role of Al, the too-hip son of the Chinese restaurant's owners. Fred Ward is Mike's father, a withdrawn Vietnam vet, and Margo Martindale -- she played the poignantly gauche American tourist in "Paris, je t'aime" -- is Mike's mother, who says of Sue at one point, "She's logical, in an emotionally annihilating way." The line is too elaborate for the character, but then the plot is too sprawling for the structure. That's often the way with debut films: so many notions, so little time.

The last homer took a while, though, because second-base umpire Dale Scott at first had waved Beltran's ball in play and Beltran temporarily had to settle for a two-run double.

A small group of lawmakers have held "pro-forma" sessions every three days. These involve the quick use of a gavel to call a session to order -- and to immediately conclude it. Doing this seemingly fulfilled a constitutional requirement for avoiding a recess, which served singular purpose: to keep the president from going around the Senate during the winter break and making a recess appointment. Or so members thought.
The revolt began in March 2011 with mostly peaceful protests, but the violent government crackdown has led many to take up weapons. A fighting force called the Free Syrian Army, made up largely of army defectors, is determined to bring down the regime by force of arms.

It was never that simple, because the NFL plans on being doggedly protective of the LA market and will tightly control the process of putting a team there. The price on the Dodgers' sale only reinforced how valuable a LA-based NFL franchise would be for the owner, and the league isn't just going to allow anyone to sweep in and cash in.

Adele’s soul-inflected pop appealed to Baby Boomers nostalgic for Etta James, Carole King and "Dusty in Memphis." It also appealed to teens struggling with the first sting of heartbreak, hipsters who missed Amy Winehouse, traditionalists weary of synthesizers and vocal effects and non-pop fans who simply found it refreshing to hear a singer belt out her blues with conviction. By singing almost exclusively about a relationship gone wrong, Adele made songs that anyone could identify with. Conventional wisdom says that in the fragmented post-modern era, an artist must target her demographic carefully, but "21" wasn’t niche-marketed. It was made for everyone and — surprise! — everyone listened.

The court punts: The Supremes have the option of declaring that a certain feature of the law is a tax, and because the tax wouldn’t kick in until 2015, they can’t rule on its constitutionality until then. This would be worse for Obama than if the law is upheld in its entirety, because it would keep alive the question of whether the bill is constitutional. But the politics would be the same as the law’s being upheld, with ObamaCare moving center stage in the election.

It's around this time of year that the familiar impulse takes hold. Hungry for the heady aroma of seldom-used seasonings like allspice and cloves, we find ourselves rooting around in the recesses of the spice cabinet.

For others, it's the only time to dust off tart pans and cookie cutters.

Top Picks Analysis: A.J. Smith normally isn't gun-shy about moving up in the first round and snaring a player he covets, but the embattled general manager benefited from holding his ground this year. In desperate need of a dangerous pass rusher to give the defense more bite, the Chargers had the good fortune of having one of this year's best in Ingram fall to them at the 18th overall choice. The squatty college lineman can quickly get to the edge with an explosive first step, plus he's stout enough to hold up against the run and displayed excellent lateral agility at the combine that will aid him in coverage. Another possible starter at a thin position was plucked with the second-round selection of Reyes, a powerful and hard-working prospect with the frame to work as a five-technique end in San Diego's 3-4 alignment. Smith's only trade of the draft came in the third round, when he vaulted five spots to claim Taylor, one of the steadying forces on a dominant LSU defense. He's a good tackler with some range and adequate speed, but his best asset may be in the leadership category.

Overall, coach Todd Graham was pleased: "Good day today,'' he said. "The one thing that's been encouraging is we hit some big shots. We're starting to get some balls down the field. We worked really, really hard on establishing the run game early and then we've really had a big emphasis on the passing game. ... We're putting them in a lot of different situations. We worked on our 4-minute offense when we're five points ahead. It's awkward for our guys to slow down, so we worked on that. We got into some two-minute situations and explained to them that we don't have a two-minute offense. It's what we do every day. Too many penalties. I thought the defense was doing well, but made some stupid penalties, which we need to do a better job with."

Introductions are key. Consider your dog's personality when introducing her to a new love interest. Tailor the first meeting to what will make her most comfortable. And, the first meeting should be in a neutral space: For an outgoing dog, it could be a dog park, for a shy dog, perhaps a friend's backyard. Praise your dog when she interacts well with your future spouse and set aside several subsequent meetings before you combine households.

The championship wraps up a dream season for the Knights (17-1-0), who reached the ‘B’ semis three years ago, but combined to go just 13-2-2 the last two years.

Wine of some sort has been made in North America since the 1500s. In the 1800s, there were significant commercial wineries in California, Missouri, Ohio and New York (Finger Lakes region), and those are just the biggies. Then two agricultural calamities -- Phylloxera and Pierce's Disease -- had a devastating effect on our vineyards. After that came the 18th Amendment, more commonly known as Prohibition, which pretty much took out commercial winemaking in the U.S. until the 1960s. By the '70s and '80s, advances in science and technology provided by University of California-Davis and other research facilities helped us take off in winemaking. Today (deserved or not), we hold a seat at the table of fine-wine producers around the world.

For the rest of his career, Rothko would refine these "color-field" works, arguing over their philosophy and formal technique with fellow practitioners Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still. The dominant interpretation of these works, including two of the Portland show's best pieces, untitled works from 1963 and 1969 featuring dark, funereal colors, is as receptacles of spirituality. They're imposing, full of presence, like monoliths. You're bound to surrender to them. I think critic Robert Hughes was on to something when he described them as being about "emptiness."

Alas, there is a less-than-enthralling performance, and that belongs to Knightley as Sabina Spielrein. When we first encounter her, she is a frantic Russian patient, sexually deranged following years of abuse. Knightley is all contorted face and lunging jaw, and it's all a bit over-the-top. Her eventual transformation is remarkable, and as the film shifts from Switzerland to Vienna, and ticks off the years from 1904 to the eve of the first World War in 1914, we encounter a Spielrein we never could have imagined.

Riverdale tried to claw back, but couldn’t seem to solve Brickner despite getting a great effort out of Dreyfuss. The senior went 5-1/3 innings while allowing four runs, only three earned, striking out four and walking three.

The horses were a little skittish crossing a couple of the fast-running streams, but Nick nudged them along and we reached the lake in time to set up our tent, fix dinner and settle in for sunset. Jumping trout snatched mosquitoes out of the air, and a Cub Scout troop arrived to share the scene. Clouds prevented what could have been a great sunset, so we called it a night and waited for sunrise. It was well worth the wait. My alarm shrilled at 5:30 the next morning, and by 6 a.m. the rising sun was painting the clouds, sky and mountaintops. The display lasted for 20 minutes and just got better and better. When it was over, I lay with my head propped up on my pack and gazed out over Alice Lake. It took some definite nudging from Nick and Gloria to get me to saddle up and start the ride back to our base camp.

Even more detrimental, we end up talking about our positions only with people we know will agree with us. Gold investors seek out other gold investors.

"(Violetta's) lease was terminated last fall and since then they've been operating under a temporary license," said Mark Ross, a bureau spokesman.

Doing forums, education, even simple things like saying, ‘Here is a football, here is what the game looks like,’ showing how to put pads on -- the more you do things like that, the greater reach it has. One day football might be an Olympic sport, who knows?”

This bill will not protect a single child. This is backward-looking, not forward-looking.”

Such projects may be the group's great dilemma. State officials believe optional toll lanes are among the best tools to offer regional congestion relief, serving exactly the function the regional referendum was meant to provide. By charging a toll that rises with congestion, they keep out people who can't afford it, thus creating one thing that does not currently exist in metro Atlanta: the choice of a reliably congestion-free lane, spanning a long distance.
