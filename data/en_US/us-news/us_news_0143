I want to thank those who have supported me personally and politically as I have struggled with this decision. I ask for your continued support in our ongoing efforts to bring about meaningful change. As this bill passes I will renew my efforts to help those state organizations which are aimed at stirring a single payer movement which eliminates the predatory role of private insurers who make money not providing health care. I have taken a detour through supporting this bill, but I know the destination I will continue to lead, for as long as it takes, whatever it takes to an America where health care will be firmly established as a civil right.

The Wings forced a Game 7 last year in their second-round series against San Jose after losing the first three games. It's largely the same group that'll attempt to rally this year.
"Medicare cannot turn on a dime," said former administrator Don Berwick, Obama's first Medicare chief. "I would not be surprised if there are delays and problems with payment flow. Medicare has dealt with sudden changes in payment before, but it is not easy."

What happened? Investors poured billions of dollars into energy commodities, namely oil. Oil is often used as a hedge against inflation by investors, and because oil is bought and sold in dollars, it essentially becomes cheaper when the dollar falls.
First, I would like to note that Wednesday's reports of Trey Burke's decision to enter the NBA draft were premature, Beilein wrote in his blog. My coaching staff and I have met with Trey and his parents several times over the past two weeks. Collectively, we have gathered and shared with each of them some necessary information that we feel will help Trey make the most informed decision for his future.
The influence of painting on photography, in fact, is one theme of the show. In 1892, for example, Denis painted "On the Beach (Two Girls Against the Light)." He returned 17 years later to take a photo against the light of two other girls wading in water by the beach. Although they are swinging a younger child this time, the swerve of their bodies and their carefree manner make them look as if they came straight out of the painting.

That eliminates Greg Schiano and Al Golden, whose Penn State ties once gave them an edge as possible Paterno replacements but now have to be viewed as a detriment. Schiano was a defensive assistant from 1991-96 under Sandusky. The school can’t go that route. Golden played and coached at Penn State. That’s now a double negative. Here are a few guys that make sense, for a lot of reasons:
After Monday's hearing, Ellis’ lawyer, Craig Gumpel, said the state was aware of his client’s job in Raleigh, a fact later confirmed by a spokesman for the state Treasury Department.
First I look at the results in half-a-dozen or so of the truly influential award ceremonies that have come before, starting with the winners of the New York Film Critics Circle and Los Angeles Film Critics Association awards — not because critics vote, but because New York and Los Angeles media help set the parameters of the possible.
In April 2005, the City Council, led by then-Mayor Tom Potter, voted 4-1 to withdraw its two police officers from the federal task force.

It is absolutely astounding that you propose that Nathan Fletcher move to the middle by refusing to accept contributions from unions while failing to mention the need to turn down contributions from businesses and special-interest PACs.
But Assembly Democrats continued to push for changes to the bill, and said today they wanted other exemptions for uncollected tax reserves, future cuts to state aid and extraordinary special education costs. Some were also upset that a compromise Christie proposed almost two weeks ago to exempt costs of already-existing contracts from the cap was left out of the current compromise.

Health tip of the week: Best cure for loneliness
There is a large studio with a tall, sloping ceiling, beneath which a row of clerestory windows descends in size as it tapers from the peak to the corner. Overhead, a massive quadruple skylight and recessed lighting add even more to the bright volume of space.
"I find it hard to summarize in mere words the amount of pain and rage this incident has caused," Thurston said.
"They're already in a fight-or-flight fear mentality, almost the Stockholm Syndrome (sympathizing with their captors). The industry can get people to advocate in their own worst interest by keeping them frightened and ashamed. They wind up advocating for a conservative base that is screwing them right and left."
These two showmen had abundant company. Denver was full of ethically challenged journalists at the time, and the era provides fodder for "The Great Wall," a new show from the Denver Center Theatre Company, opening next week.

Whatever you want to call it, he lied. And he deceived audiences. He deceived the Public Theater. He then deceived media outlets. And, unfortunately, he deceived the voiceless Chinese workers more than anyone, and that really breaks my heart.
Less than a month later on Sept. 19, a cached copy of Ravi's account shows he tweeted: "Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude. Yay."
Center Al Horford, who returned to action for Game 4 for the first time since January surgery to repair a torn left pectoral muscle, said the offense was not slowed by trying to work him back into the rotation. He said Johnson has to be more aggressive and still be mindful of the importance of quick ball movement when double-teamed. Getting Johnson more touches does not mean more Iso-Joe offense.

In ’07-08, even though John had already taken over most of the operation’s responsibilities years earlier, it still felt like his dad’s team, to an extent — much of it was put together during the patriarch’s gentle years, even if we all know how it was John Mara and Ernie Accorsi who had to talk him into Eli Manning in ’03.
Johnson, who has built a reputation for community involvement since his playing days ended, would own a small stake in the Dodgers, as would Guber, who is co-owner of the NBA's Golden State Warriors.

More than any data point or presidential speech, one life shows what can happen when people are given a chance to make it. And that's why Hernandez Luna gave her floor speech. She told me that some of her colleagues have a certain perception of illegal immigrants. She wanted them to see a colleague who had been one and how that illegal immigrant turned out.
Arndt said some other studies have indicated people become violent when they think about a catastrophe that jeopardizes their group. But another study showed those who were reminded of death and thought about a global threat instead were more likely to associate themselves with peace and humanity.
Certain guys weren't deemed to be ready for that level. The same conclusion can be drawn in the secondary, where Bryant was put into the starting lineup as a true freshman after Moeller was lost in the Illinois game.

Just looking at that title of John C. Murphy's letter to the editor ("Catholics should know better than to oppose gay marriage," April 18) makes me laugh. As if the writer is some expert on what people should know. Maybe we can call it Murphy's Law — Catholics are not allowed to protest on anything. After all, the writer claims that Catholics were denied rights in Colonial Maryland, and after two more unrelated and arguable sentences, there is supposed to be some analogy to gay marriage.
Eight people injured on an escalator that malfunctioned at Giants Stadium in December have filed notices announcing they intend to sue the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, lawyers for the injured said today.

The judge dismissed Wells Fargo's arguments that customers wanted and benefited from the policies, and detailed evidence he said showed efforts to obscure the practices in statements and other materials. Wells Fargo's online banking system, for example, would display pending purchases in chronological order, "leading customers to believe that the processing would take place in that order."

Technology companies have invested billions of dollars in buying up patent portfolios that they can use defensively or offensively against rivals and spent still more money litigating in the United States and Europe.
Though SLU came in having won four of the past five with Dayton (11-4), the series usually has featured close games. This was the sixth time in the past six seasons the teams had gone to overtime (one was a double OT) and there was another game decided by one point that didn't go to overtime. History says that not much separates these teams.
Local governments cut 28,000 jobs last month, the most since November. Nearly 18,000 of those jobs were in education.
When McNabb got his hands on the ball again Monday night, he took a deep shot immediately. Incomplete. Three plays later, he tried again and Patterson picked him off.
Unlike the lucky students of classicist Madeline Miller, I was never exposed to Homer in my youth. Until I was 60 and writing about Doc Holliday (who read the classics in their original languages), the closest I came to "The Iliad" was watching Brad Pitt in "Troy."

Still, Mr. Einhorn is emerging as one of the most public faces of an industry accused of reticence and secrecy. While not known for being overly critical of companies, the 39-year-old manager of Greenlight Capital has lambasted credit-rating firms and bond insurers at events in recent months before hundreds of investors. And last month, he made incendiary remarks about Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

* The civil rights movement is in full swing: The Season 5 opener, "A Little Kiss," is bookended by a pair of scenes featuring African Americans seeking equal opportunity. The second-class citizen status of minorities has been a low-burn background theme in "Mad Men" since the first episode. I wish it wasn't handled with such self-consciousness in this season-opener, though.
Be warned, however: The saltiness takes over after a few bites. But this appetizer is intended for small nibbles only.

"In actual practice, most patients need several sequential treatment steps to achieve remission," said the authors of the Lancet "seminar," all from the University of Pittsburgh's Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.

Even worse, Canales inherits a gutted roster that no one outside his locker room things can win consistently.

"You had to be here to believe it," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said.
What does this title mean? Well, more than a typical conference tournament title. And the No..1 seed in the NCAA tournament that MSU received afterward for the West Regional. Officially, Michigan State only won the Big Ten tournament championship. But in their hearts, the Spartans have to feel like they won a playoff for the regular-season title, which they shared with Ohio State and Michigan. The Spartans downplayed that, but the emotion is unavoidable.
I visited the class last week to see who it attracted. I was also curious why non-traditional students didn't rely on cable news, which is basically a collection of political porn this time of year.
Clinicians will continue to use an algorithm of symptoms to help screen for combat stress, but PTSD should no longer be summarily ruled out if a soldier meets most of the definitions but fails to exhibit classic signs of fear or helplessness, he said.
Indeed, it was a shared empathy of that sort that helped motivate female voters to action and propel a new wave of female Democratic politicians to Congress in the wake of the Thomas hearings, including Sen.

In July, after Christie slashed a version of the budget offered by Democrats, Sweeney let loose with a string of vulgarities that still has tongues clucking.
BROOKLYN, Ohio - Gov.-elect John Kasich paid a visit to American Greetings Corp. executives Thursday to talk about how to keep the company from leaving Ohio.
Brandon Roy, Trail Blazers. Roy is a likely candidate to be waived, because knee injuries have torpedoed his rise to stardom and he now has four years and $68 million on his contract (the fourth year is an early-termination option). It’s not an easy thing to let go of a player with Roy’s ability, especially if Portland has to keep paying his sizable contract. But the Blazers traded for Raymond Felton in the offseason with an eye on picking up the tempo, and even when healthy, Roy is a half-court specialist.

I can say that the men on my new movie ‘The Grey' have become fantastic friends to me even now that we've stopped filming. We call each other all the time and talk about regular stuff like how it's s---ty get older or how our kids know that we're full of crap when we discipline them.

In the second period, a power play for Detroit arose after Brent Seabrook was sent off for delay of game, but the best the Wings could do was bang two pucks off posts.

It’s the same cool approach that Soderbergh, 49, brings to his own life. Detail-oriented (he often shoots and edits his own films), he arrives for his interview in a Soho hotel ahead of time and without assistants — an interview that he’s requested run long, so he can be sure to answer everything fully. Bullet-headed and black-suited, he’s as no-nonsense as a projectile speeding toward its target.

When everyone is tired from a day of fun, set aside some lap time. Even big dogs like to snuggle with their people.

Ball lost more than 25 pounds during the early months of the 2011 offseason and it paid off during the season. Wisconsin’s touchdown machine combines speed, power and—did we mention touchdowns already? No one does them better, or at least no one does them more often: a ridiculous 38 scored for Ball this season, 32 of them on the ground. He’s not all TDs, mind you; his 1,759 yards on the ground merely lead the nation.

Logically and politically, this makes no sense. On the logic front, it can't work. Three bills under consideration in the House that are intended to fund the transportation bill would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, mandate oil shale leasing on federal lands and expand offshore drilling in sensitive areas. Yet even if drilling were allowed in these places, it would be many years before significant revenues started rolling in to the government, and it's difficult to predict how much money would be generated, making advance construction planning impossible. Moreover, oil shale development is an unproven technology that may never generate a dime. And politically, drilling in such places as the Alaskan refuge is rightly a nonstarter.

For the most part, the one-theme episode worked well. And as anybody who's witnessed the patient hordes braving a cold Portland morning to get into whatever the breakfast-joint-of-the-moment may be, this is an urban phenomenon well worth making fun of.

The smaller leak discharges into the creek near the permitted outfall, Menne said. Water from the larger seep is contained on Ameren property by a raised road bed encircling the plant and preventing any runoff.

Of course the story of a bright, independent-minded woman trying to navigate her way within two clashing patriarchal cultures wasn't a particularly hard sell.

Opponents also are shooting nearly three percentage points lower than a season ago.

After the Timberwolves blew a 21-point lead in a loss to Golden State on Sunday, guard J.J. Barea said there were a lot of guys in the team's locker room who didn't care. After practice Tuesday, coach Rick Adelman basically agreed. That is, Adelman said, if what Barea was talking about was a complacency about losing.
Griffin said she was also surprised by how poorly Americans regard themselves as tourists. In the survey, 20% of respondents said the United States was the country with the worst tourists. “I was honestly surprised that we ranked ourselves as the worst,” she said. “We’re humble travelers. We know that we have a lot to learn when we go outside our country.”

Critics of the Massachusetts cap say there were vast differences between New Jersey now and the Bay State in 1980, when the cap was enacted.

With Matt Forte out two to six weeks with a sprained MCL, Marion Barber (76 carries, 281 yards, five TDs) will start and Kahlil Bell (15, 57, 0) will fill Barber's reserve role.

Barber hasn't had a productive game in a starting role since 2009 with Cowboys (14 carries, 91 yards vs. Eagles). But he'll have an opportunity vs. Broncos' 20th-ranked run defense. Toby Gerhart, subbing for Adrian Peterson, had 91 yards on 21 carries vs. Broncos last week.

Howie even wants to try and have another baby someday, keeping the child seat buckled inside the car just in case.

After Eduardo Nunez’s error-free debut in left field for the Yankees on Monday, the mistakes finally showed up in a 7-1 loss to Baltimore last night. An error and two more mistakes were a reminder the young Nunez is a shaky enough glove in the infield, and a complete neophyte in the outfield.

Martin said many times people notice a car that seems to be driving by too frequently or something or someone that "their gut tells them is wrong" and they wonder if they should call the police. Even if they decide they should, they sometimes forget to make the call because their cell phone rings or a child needs help or they are bringing in their groceries. It's only after they learn about a burglary in the neighborhood or other incident that they remember they saw something and didn't call ... hence the "without delay," Martin said.

Although odd noises emerged from the wings as stagehands went about their business, Woetzel, in a T-shirt and stretch pants, focused intently on the Chopin selections being played by pianist Cameron Grant as the dancer rehearsed three solos choreographed by Jerome Robbins, two of them from 1969's "Dances at a Gathering." Woetzel alternated between the reflective, understated quality required by the opening of "Dances" and the buoyant turns and seamless phrasing of a turbulent solo that comes late in the ballet. For the first, he consulted with the pianist about a particular moment, wanting the music to be "a tiny bit slower, just to let the thought establish."
