The winning design, by the New York architecture firm Rogers Marvel, aided by the landscape architects Quennell Rothschild & Partners, is a nimble combination of boldness and restraint. It was clearly the strongest and among the least traditional in the competition, which also featured teams led by landscape architects Van Valkenburgh and Walter Hood. For that reason alone, I doubted that the cleanly surgical Rogers Marvel plan would win: Federal design competitions, particularly for sites in Washington, are known for going the inoffensive route. Responding to an unusually restrictive and detailed competition brief, Rogers Marvel proposes stretching the main security perimeter south of the White House so that it includes the entirety of the Ellipse, the large lawn area that runs between E Street and the Washington Monument. The Ellipse will now be ringed by a new granite bench, its back roughly 40 inches high, that doubles as a ram-proof wall. That move allows the architects to open up and simplify the design of E Street. They also propose raising the Ellipse itself by at least two feet, so that it offers better views of the White House, and toughening up its grass, so that it can better stand up to heavy use.

Second, Mr. Cameron was not the only European leader to put domestic political concerns above the wider European interest. It was Angela Merkel's need to appease her own party in Germany that forced the rest of the euro zone down the highly precarious path of seeking a treaty change to embed new fiscal rules; it is Ms. Merkel's fear for her own political position that leads her to oppose any expansion in euro-zone bailout funds, an expanded role for the ECB or euro bonds. Similarly, it was Nicolas Sarkozy's determination to re-establish his Gaullist credentials ahead of next year's French presidential election that led him to reject any further handover of sovereignty to Brussels and led him to push for the new fiscal rules to be enshrined in a new inter-governmental treaty instead.

A: We all knew each other. We'd all worked with each other before, in different mediums -- in the theater, on television or in films. It was very nice in that respect because if you work with someone, you have sort of a shorthand with them. Bill and I have been husband and wife a few times. That was quite nice.... I'd worked with Tom only once, I think on the radio. Of course you're very aware of their work, too.... One's very aware of each other's work.

The game was going to offer Mike Matheny some intriguing decisions headed into the late innings. He had Kyle McClellan set for the eighth inning and, presumably, Fernando Salas assigned for the ninth. They would get a one-run lead to protect. It was later in spring training that Dave Duncan and Tony La Russa would use pitchers in such situation-specific moments, but that's also just how the game played out for Matheny. The righties figured to benefit from early exposure to late-inning, lead-holding duties.

Taylor, aboard the Elise G., has been fishing since he was 18 years old. To him, it appeared the container or cargo ship had slowed considerably, perhaps even stopped. Not far from the ship, he noticed the green mast-light of a fishing boat flickering in the dark. Normally, just below the green light, is a white light, part of a signal system that indicates to vessels in the vicinity that the boat is a fishing trawler and is underway. Taylor observed neither a white signal, nor the fishing boat’s bright deck lights, which are usually turned on whether the vessel is dredging or not.

Unimpressed with the complaints, a land-use board in Crow Wing County unanimously approved the Teppers' request in August. That kind of indulgence is typical in the heart of Minnesota's vacationland, where lakefront development has continued despite the recession. Since 2005, land-use boards in Cass and Crow Wing counties allowed hundreds of home builders to break rules aimed at preserving the state's most valuable natural resource, according to a Star Tribune review of thousands of pages of building records. Altogether, those boards approved nearly nine of every 10 requests to deviate from development standards.

The term "Homeric" can be code for overripe prose, sweeping epic plots and a mob of indistinguishable heroic characters. That pejorative is more aptly applied to florid, opaque translations of Homer.

A. I would describe J.C. Penney as one of a handful of great American brands that seemed like it was dormant, that had been a great part of the fabric of America for almost a century but it just wasn't modern. It wasn't top of mind. Everybody can tell a story about their mom or their grandma or the old catalog days. But they don't have modern stories. Because we haven't been creative enough so we have to rethink everything.

The rates tend to follow trends in Treasury bonds, a safe haven that looked appealing to investors this week after a weaker than expected jobs report for March led to a selloff in stocks. Heavy demand sent the yield on the 10-year Treasury note lower, pulling down long-term mortgage rates.
The yield on the benchmark Spanish 10-year bonds rose Friday to 6.06 percent, a jump of 0.28 percentage points on the day and uncomfortably high.

This was not the Usher who seemed slightly sluggish in performance at the Summer Jam concert at New Meadowlands Stadium in June, or whose computer-assisted turn at MTV’s Video Music Awards in September felt like a triumph of robotics over soul. This was Usher hitting his marks with the assurance of a point guard running a break, fit from weeks on the road supporting "Versus" and "Raymond vs. Raymond," his slightly underwhelming 2010 releases. Over the last decade plus, Usher has been accustomed to topping the charts, and he didn’t skip any of his hits: In fact, he’s got so much top-flight material that he was able to burn some blockbusters ("Confessions Pt. 2," "My Way") in a medley without weakening the set.

“Every municipality has a different ruling on poultry,” said Metz. “Some don’t even have an adapted policy for poultry. I’ve contacted a few municipalities to get their take on it.

I’ve been corresponding back and forth with Barbara to assist her in obtaining good contacts and ordinances in place in other municipalities that she could use as a reference point.”

The Hoboken of 2012 bears little resemblance to the nearly deserted, blue-collar factory town that Key and Harris discovered in 1983, and the same goes for the New York City neighborhood where they now live. “That’s the beauty of a city,” she says. “It’s not supposed to stay the same.

Such changes would be welcome, but many experts feel they don't go far enough to encourage participation by large pharmaceutical companies. Congress should consider additional remedies, such as extending the FDA's Orphan Drug program — which provides grants and other financial incentives for research on medications to treat rare diseases — to include antibiotics and redirecting National Institutes of Health funding from lower-priority projects to academic research. A multipronged effort by industry, universities and government, much like the effort that made AIDS a treatable disease, is needed to combat this looming health threat.

The discount is so deep from list prices of $20 and more that it's widely believed Amazon is selling the e-books at a loss as a way of attracting more customers and forcing competitors to lower their prices. Amazon also has been demanding higher discounts from publishers, and stopped offering e-books from the Independent Publishers Group, a Chicago-based distributor, after they couldn't agree to terms.

As long time fans of the CART racing series, which has evolved into the Indy Car Racing League, and as race attendees in Denver, Toronto, Mid-Ohio and Road America over the years, my husband and I were thrilled when the city of Baltimore announced its intention to host an Indy Grand Prix. For its inaugural effort, Baltimore did a fantastic job. Though some kinks need to be worked out (fan entrance and exit fluidity, additional race car passing zones), Baltimore was in some ways superior to other race venues we have been to. The grandstands were easily accessible. There were plenty of restroom facilities so that you didn't have to walk far or wait long, there were food and souvenir booths everywhere, rather than just in a central location, and the workers and volunteers we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. In addition, it was a bonus to be able to walk along the Inner Harbor and throughCamden Yards.

TRENTON -- Facing competing pressures on whether he should grant Justice John Wallace lifetime tenure on the New Jersey Supreme Court, Gov.

Wallace's term expires May 20.

Mr. Abbas' best hope to achieve his goal of Palestinian statehood is to seek to exert a similar modifying influence over Hamas. His first goal should be to persuade Hamas to remove the provision from its charter that calls for the destruction of Israel. Doing so would put far more pressure on Israel to negotiate a two-state solution with the Palestinians than his stunt at the UN did last fall. Moreover, Israel faces significant regional uncertainty, particularly in light of increased tensions with Iran and the civil war raging in Syria. Now might be a propitious time for it to forge a lasting peace with the Palestinians, thus strengthening its international standing and quelling a threat at home. To take advantage of the situation, Mr. Abbas would have to exercise the kind of statesmanship that has been sadly lacking among the Palestinians for generations. Could he achieve such a thing? It's too early to say, but it is in the best interests of his people and the entire region that he try.

The truth is, as much liberating fun as it can be to play with a few pals in a rock band, jazz combo or chamber music group — all of which I've done and still do — there's something uniquely transformative that can happen when a large group of disparate individuals yield their differences under the guidance of an inspired and knowledgeable leader to bring a singular vision to reality.

-Oregon Jewish Museum: Tucked away in the Alphabet District of northwest Portland, this exhibit space/research center focuses on the Jewish community in Oregon from 1850 to the present day. In the art gallery, "Transport - Works by Henk Pander and Esther Podemski" (through May 20) offers contrasting takes to World War II memory. Pander, drawing from childhood memories of Nazi-occupied Holland, has a striking, fluid touch in his watercolor and ink-wash pictures - "Burying the Silver," "The Hideout" - and is a little more stilted in his oil-on-linen reworking of the same subject matter. Podemski pushes her images in a more abstract direction as she addresses the realities of the nightmare world her Polish-Jewish father escaped. "Night Sky Steam" and the three-panel "From a Moving Train" are especially evocative. (1953 N.W. Kearney St., 503-226-3600 or www.ojm.org)

As guests prepare in the kitchen, you can be setting the stage on the dining table. It's delightful to extend the honey theme to spring's birds and bees.

Of course you can go back to some of the spots we mentioned earlier, but do yourself a favor and try a couple that we've enjoyed late-night beverages in. On Seventh itself, the Reservoir Bar is a no-frills spot that just feels like a good spot to land if you haven't scored or if you aren't into other scenes at the moment. In other words, it's a good spot to clear your head before you head home. If you've got some stamina left, look for the entrance to the James Joyce Irish Pub right next to the Green Iguana. Head upstairs, keeping those steep steps in mind as you gauge your steadiness factor later. Inside, you'll find a pretty good version of a drinking parlor for those who are fond of black and tans. Best part? Its high windows let you look down on the Seventh Avenue revelry below.

Much was learned from the upheaval caused by dislocations in the industrial northeast. Now a mass layoff in any industry triggers a "rapid response."

Were it not for the fact that John Q. Public probably regards each bout as a sort of semifinal, either would get high marks as a stand-alone event.

Sean Meagher: If there's one thing Rudy Fernandez does consistently, it's inconsistency.
