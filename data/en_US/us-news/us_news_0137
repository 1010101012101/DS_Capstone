Local donors were surprised last year to learn that then-Hillsborough Commissioner Jim Norman was on the Salvation Army's payroll to the tune of $95,000 a year and that his compensation included use of a car for work he said he did largely on weekends.

One expects "Detention" to garner a few reviews calling it the coolest movie of the year and to win some fans of a certain age who will view it multiple times and write 10,000-word blog entries cataloging every single reference and inside joke.

Anyway, here is a list of players who visited the Giants this past weekend. (About 20 who were there, from what I'm told.) They're non-local players and teams can bring in only up to 30 of them, so they're a better indication than the ones who come in for local workouts.

It doesn't often happen that the spinoff is as compelling as the original. It just goes to show you can replicate all the elements and yet the magic, that unknown element that animates the restaurant, can be missing in action.

And that's bad news, because about 1 in 4 U.S. adults — including many sugar junkies who look lean and fit — already have the syndrome. "Everyone needs to be aware of the danger," he says.

Transferable skills from the day job: "They're symbiotic.

Also, not everybody who calls upon city hall is a voter, but also business interests come to our city that I feel we can serve well by virtue of my legal and public policy background. In reverse, my experience as mayor gives me an understanding of how and why government functions as it does and makes me a better lawyer and helps me provide better counsel to my clients who are oftentimes working with governmental agencies."

But recently, Andrew Leigh, Eric Zitzewitz and I have turned to assessing whether a similar bias affects political prediction markets.

But in lopsided contests, prediction markets really tend to overstate the support for underdogs.

Indeed, SDG&E admitted that the increased voltage will likely increase the electromagnetic fields known as EMF. SDG&E tries to dismiss concerns over health impacts from prolonged exposure to high levels of EMF by saying it's not proven, but there are scientists on both sides of the issue. Some insist it causes higher incidences of brain tumors in adults and childhood leukemia. ABC and CBS local news have both aired stories recently about residents living near transmission lines and substations who are convinced that stray voltage in their neighborhoods have caused a host of health issues including cancer and birth defects. Many San Juan residents agree and are concerned that living close to transmission lines has caused them to develop cancer.

Similarly, in the Christian Bible, Jesus' disciples abandon Him as He faces death. Peter denies knowing Jesus when challenged in the high priest's courtyard, while other disciples flee after His arrest. Their actions might have been motivated by fear and self-preservation.

Director/writer Steve Taylor doesn't always clearly delineate Don's crisis. The college sophomore's pious side seems to be dispatched in about 30 seconds, and it's not always easy to gauge where Don is on his existential journey (granted, it's not easy to make such journeys visual).

"Blue Like Jazz" also seems to take pains to steer clear of Don's sexual desires (does he have any?), sometimes to its detriment. He's a handsome college kid surrounded by liberated young women, for heaven's sake!

Lime juice adds enough acid to keep the fruity guacamole from turning dark. Add a few fresh veggies on the side for scooping as well.

WILLRICH: Prior to the passage of SB 1070, law-enforcement officials at the border have always had the ability to stop vehicles and question the occupants about their citizenship. In addition, the driver can be arrested for transporting an illegal immigrant. The border agent must have specific and articulable facts that provides reasonable suspicion. The facts that could raise the suspicion could include observation of the occupant's demeanor, general appearance and clothing. SB 1070, if enacted, purports to enforce federal immigration law under conditions of a lawful traffic stop.

Rossiter has been embroiled in a negative financial climate for years, especially since negative state audits indicated significant errors in financial reporting. Except for one small transaction under $100 deemed improper, which Rossiter covered out of her own pocket, no fraud was alleged, but state auditors said conditions existed that could support fraud.
There is no doubt that it is unusual, but it is neither unprecedented nor unconstitutional. In fact, relevant case law shows that such a procedural change by the legislature is presumed to affect current cases unless the General Assembly specifies otherwise. The bill does not, as has been widely and incorrectly reported, send cases like this one straight to the Court of Special Appeals. Circuit courts would still have original jurisdiction. Nor does it tilt the scales in favor of the State Center project. The legislature is not changing any of the standards by which the State Center lawsuit will be judged but is instead adding another step to the legal process. If the case that the state broke its procurement law in approving the State Center deal is as strong as the litigants say it is, then the only effect of the General Assembly's action will be to drag out the legal process even more, which only benefits the project's opponents.

This may not affect the peace process, the fate of which rests less on the makeup of Israel's government than on Obama's level of determination. Obama has indicated that he wants to have the United States play the role of "honest broker" between Israelis and Palestinians rather than continue to act like "Israel's lawyer," as former Middle East mediator Aaron David Miller described the U.S. stance under Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

At the visitors center, Ranger David DeWitt said poppies, lupine, chuparosa, penstemon, owl clover, ocotillo and brittlebush will be better than average this year. On my visit in late February, some of these flowers made a shy appearance along the roadside.

As it turned out, other, earlier reports had already been purged from the CPS database because they had been ruled “unsubstantiated.” If a report is checked out and deemed to lack enough evidence, it is ruled unsubstantiated; if a case is ruled to have enough merit to be investigated further, it is “substantiated.”

It must be difficult for a guy who is used to being the star to sit and watch, I've thought in recent weeks. For Roy to see the attention and activity post-game around the lockers of Andre Miller and Lamarcus Aldridge, and not his locker, must feel awful.

While "Search" garnered positive reviews from NME, Pitchfork and NPR's "All Songs Considered," the attention didn't translate into national or even regional attention in the form of additional gigs. The idea of playing more shows outside of Northeast Ohio is definitely a goal -- and unfortunately so far a hurdle for the band. "We need to go out and play Chicago, New York City, Boston and stuff," Tolar said. "We've been contacting the clubs, but it's just tough. Sometimes I feel like I don't really understand why we're not able to get shows. We've gotten some decent press, I don't know why it's as hard as it is."
