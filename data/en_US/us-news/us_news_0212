The game's far from perfect; technically it's still in beta, and it's prone to frequent crashing. Spending real money in the game can get ungodly expensive - 1,000 platinum, which won't buy you much at the game's upper levels, costs $99.90.
"Kiewit/Reyes' contract was awarded over five years ago, well before any indictments or charges were levied against those particular subcontractors," city aviation spokeswoman Tammy Chase says.
“Just knowing someone’s going to commit a crime does not make you liable,” he said. “There’s no legal obligation to keep that spouse from getting run over, or drowning, or being shot, as far as criminal responsibility.”
That reminded me of the eulogy delivered by Lord Earl Spencer at the funeral of his sister, Princess Diana, as he decried the public obsession to uncover something dirty in her personal life.

The noodles are then ready to turn into a dish perfect for the warm weather still on the horizon for our always-late Bay Area summer.
Thursday night, I asked longtime NFL scout Dave Razzano for his opinion of the Brockers pick. Razzano is an independent thinker; his refusal to be a yes-man in draft war rooms cost him a job or two, because GMs and coaches don't want a lowly scout to tell them they're making a mistake in drafting a certain player.
The only solid source of information for detectives has been Carter, who now lives in East Orange. She said she heard Jones’ account of the evening as she sat by his hospital bed, before he fell into the coma.

"Lame duck’s becoming so anticlimactic," said Senate Majority Leader Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester), who will become Senate president when the new session begins Jan. 12. "There are very important pieces of legislation that are going to move through, but the energy level in past lame ducks seems different." Many bills faded because they would have required new spending without the state revenue to support them, Sweeney said.

"To the end, Atiyah kept trying to rein in attacks inside the Middle East," said Jarret Brachman, an author and consultant on Al-Qaida to U.S. government agencies.

NCAA prospects: In 52 previous tournament appearances, the Wildcats have reached the Final Four 14 times and won seven national championships -- the last in 1998 when they defeated Utah.
That meatball hero soars because Sandri has done the homework and the math. He hits that righteous ratio of dense, juicy meat to bread (a buttery-crusty Philly-style roll), all packaged with a hint of cheese and just enough marinara to grease the works. Sandri swears the recipe is straight from his mom's note cards in New Jersey, but even Mom isn't using 21-day aged Highland Oak beef from the Stayton farm also favored by the fine-dining destination Paley's Place. Menu temptations include arancini (fried risotto balls) for a mere $1. But watch for specials, like pulled pork with homemade watermelon pickles or the terrific Devil's Chicken ($9.50), a bio-dynamic bird marinated all day in a thick powerhouse of calabrian chiles, mustard and garlic that majestically clings to the beautifully bronzed skin.
"More government spending and more government jobs are not the answer," said Wadsworth GOP Rep. Jim Renacci. "Every dollar spent by the federal government must first be taken from someone through taxation or borrowed. That is not how you create jobs or grow the economy."

We always felt welcomed at Zanzibar, even on a Sunday morning when we had the nerve to walk in without a reservation just after the door was unlocked. Gracious greetings and a comfy window-front waiting area kept us -- and plenty of others -- patient. Once we took our seats, we watched the host fold and arrange newspapers we left behind. The aim for elegance is true.

This season casting directors will be on the lookout for applicants who have challenges living an everyday life that most take for granted, struggling with weight issues, affected by a natural disaster, products of home or alternative schooling, followers of unrecognized or non-mainstream belief systems, elite athletes, recent graduates affected by the economic downturn, those involved with goth, emo, or punk subculture, members of a pro-abstinence organization, those who are recently single due to a tragedy, someone who has recently gotten out of the foster care system, and individuals who want to bring the spotlight of “The Real World” to a cause, condition, or social issue they care deeply about or are personally affected by. We are also particularly interested in cast members who have had to work hard to support themselves and move ahead in their lives.

It's likely that everybody in warm, English-speaking climates has heard that phrase before, probably this week. It's been brutally hot here lately and there are only so many annual summer clichés to go around; "dog days" must have rated a mention. The phrase generally refers to the hottest stretch of weather in late July and August, the kind of days known for stifling, breezeless, oven-like air. But why blame the poor dogs?

You might remember. Although he owned a .569 winning percentage with three NCAA tournament appearances in 15 years with the Broncos, school officials decided in early February 2007 that Davey needed to "retire" at season's end and asked him to announce it immediately. Not after the last game. Right then. The loyal basketball man complied publicly, while explaining to his players that it wasn't his idea.
Roy said he did not experience a setback and expressed hope that he would play against the Lakers. However, McMillan said he wanted to make sure Roy did not experience swelling or discomfort in his knees overnight and elected to hold off making a decision on Roy's status until watching him go through Wednesday morning's shootaround.

Those days seem to have passed.
Punk's pre-match promo was great, as well. He drew on the comparisons between his straight-edge lifestyle and Bryan's vegan one to create a few lines that, if nothing else, brought a smile to the face of this fan. The line about AJ shaving her head was gold, in my opinion.
In the spring of 1995, when scouts started coming around mostly to see an outfielder named Greg Millichap, Jensen could hear them chattering behind the backstop during infield practice about his catcher. “He could really catch and throw,” said Jensen. “I was a part-time scout with the Mariners. So, prior to the June draft, I took Tommy to a pre-draft workout at the Kingdome with a bunch of other prospects. He put on a show. He hit two or three balls out in batting practice with a wood bat and was probably the best-throwing guy there. But everybody knew by then he was going to Michigan.”
Tsonga was making his debut in the clay-court event and had a bye into the second round. But he has never won a title on clay and was outplayed by the 134th-ranked German, who once was ranked No. 2. Tsonga is ranked fifth, but never had a break point against Haas.

At issue is an agreement publishers made with Steve Jobs in 2010, as he was about to launch the iPad. At that time, Amazon's Kindle had 90% of the market for e-books. Book publishers had imported the "wholesale model" from the print world, where they sold retailers books for roughly half the recommended cover price. This made sense in the bricks-and-mortar world of returns of unsold books and expensive inventory. It was in the interests of publishers and booksellers to sell at whatever the market would bear.
But only about 2 percent of the city's current units are priced at below-market rates that lower-income households can afford, according to the San Mateo County Department of Housing. The new units won't do much to change that picture.

During cross examination, Messitt pointed out that the Education Department’s own handbook on campus crime that spells out the Clery Act uses examples of colleges that waited days — not hours — to alert the campus about sexual assaults and cites the responses as a positive way to handles such cases. Moore said the examples shouldn’t be in the handbook.
"If people ask you what this campaign is about, you tell them it’s still about hope. You tell them it’s still about change.

The waiters are well trained in tableside service and do a magnificent job boning the fish and presenting the dishes. While the restaurant could easily seem corporate and impersonal, the staff combines a welcoming air with laid-back New Orleans style and efficiency. Still, at times they aren't versed in the menu, not knowing the cheeses or cookies, for example, and they often forget to tell guests about the chocolate souffle ($10) that takes 20 minutes to prepare.

“Corril Slayer” captures the fear and the horror pitch-perfectly for anyone with a soft spot for side-scrollers like “Caslevania” or “Mega-Man.” You are Sam Asherton, a botched lobotomy patient who vaguely resembles a young James Spader.

The laws affecting women in Tunisia, and to some extent in Egypt, are among the most progressive in the Middle East, so the potential for backsliding in those countries is real. And women in Yemen, Bahrain, Libya and Iraq, where the spreading unrest has been met with government force, have also struggled for their rights and likewise have reason to be concerned if their governments fall or start handing out concessions.

The description on Amazon reads like a bizarre joke: "Swastika, starring Adolf Hitler, Eva Braun, Josef Goebbels et al." It's bizarre, but no joke. Hitler, his mistress and some of his henchmen are the real-life subjects, if not the stars, of Philippe Mora's controversial 1973 documentary.

Some of the scenes, intercut with Nazi propaganda films and ominous newsreel footage of the Nazis' rise to power in the 1930s, were shot by Braun in 16mm color. They're home movies, with all the cheerfulness and awkwardness the term implies, except that the home is Obersalzberg, Hitler's Bavarian mountain retreat, where Hitler is seen giving a persuasive—unless you pay close attention—impression of a full human being.

I am tired of hearing people make the excuse that they cannot change the way they were raised when considering their position. It is a cop-out. We are thinking adults who can use our brains to evaluate the evidence. When that evidence shows that a belief we have held — even one we have held for all or most of our lives — is wrong, we can either double down and ignore it because we are afraid to have been wrong, or we can embrace it and make ourselves more significant by helping to advance humanity.

If the Wrecking Crew can be said to have had a leader, it was probably drummer Hal Blaine, who was the contractor for many of the sessions, played on more than 50 No. 1 records, and is interviewed in the film with several other of the players and producers. Now 83, he's frustrated -- although not surprised -- that "The Wrecking Crew" hasn't been released commercially. (Screenings at film festivals are nonprofit showcases for filmmakers.)

They responded. Scallops caramelized with dark miso were drizzled with green tea. A sweet and citrusy sauce steeped from oolong-orange tea added softness to Madras-curried duck. But it was the sushi, as pristine as ever, that reminded me of Morimoto's worth, with silver needlefish, pink kanpachi, and perfect snapper folded over rice, itself the key ingredient. It gets polished from brown to white in the basement each morning to retain its extraordinary texture. Just as Master Morimoto planned.
There are 3.7 million Buick owners in China and 60% of sales are high-end, said Jean Liu-Barnocki, brand director for Buick China, which has 114 dealerships offering full coverage in larger tier 1 and 2 cities and 50% coverage in smaller tier 3 cities.

The new exams would be a graduation requirement for students currently in 4th grade and younger.
Unlike most of my peers, I didn't hate the first season's ambiguous ending. In fact, because the characters were so involving, particularly that of homicide detective Sarah Linden, played by Emmy-nominated best actress Mireille Enos, I was willing to follow Sud's story ever deeper into the mystery. This is a story about a murky process, not about a definitive resolution. It's deliberately soaked in confusion and misdirection. And so I embrace the dilemma.
"Who reads them?" asks Bruce Nyman, a former county official from Long Island, N. Y., who has grown tired of the many disclaimers attached to messages in his inbox. He says they are like the modern-day mattress tag. "And has anyone ever been arrested for tearing them off?"

"The snow that was left on the ground, especially on the more north-facing slopes, turned into that weak layer that we've been talking about all winter, sitting at the base of the snowpack."
Overview: Matt Kenseth won last year. The Roush Fenway Racing gang will ride into town with guns blazing. Greg Biffle could leave with the cash.
Added John Dadian, a Republican political consultant not involved in the race: "Typically they are trying to find one little thing that the person who filed their taxes doesn't remember, or wasn't aware of, to splash on the front page and make the candidate look bad."
"But I think there's always that sense of urgency. I don't think anybody's willing to say ‘in three years or four years.' You look at the Nationals. It took them awhile, but they've got a pretty good team. One or two players makes a big difference."
It is easy for someone like me to be outraged by these clear violations of our dignity, if not our civil liberties. After all, I've been covering the most unpopular government agency since its inception a decade ago. I have been threatened by the TSA, lied to by it and been served with an illegal subpoena to force me to name a source (I didn't).

The service had said the aircraft's cost at $215 million apiece make it less cost-effective than the existing U-2 spy planes that burst on the scene in the 1950s and were critical in finding Soviet missiles in Cuba in 1962. The military wanted to rely on the U-2 instead of the Global Hawk drones.
Medium security is still pretty secure -- perhaps more so at Two Rivers, because the prison is broken into several sub-prisons with a small number of inmates who rarely see anyone from the other groups, and no Big Yard offers prisoners the freedom to roam and congregate, to an extent, as they wish. It's safer, more secure and in a way, even more confining.

The couple left and I stood there for a while. For years I had come to see baseball games simply as sporting events. After that incident, I realized that, for some people, it was much more than that. A part-time player and an official baseball had so much more significance than I had ever supposed. I never saw a game the same way again.
"The New Jersey settlement reflects the implementation of a national settlement reached by Wells Fargo Investments on Nov. 18, 2009," said spokesman Vince Scanlon in a statement. "(It) is related to the repurchase of auction rate securities stemming from the failure of ARS auctions in 2008."

Even after he served four years in prison on charges his supporters say were fabricated, local officials kept Chen, his wife and their 6-year-old daughter confined at home after his release in September 2010. They did so even though there was no legal basis for the detention, preventing outsiders from visiting the family and occasionally beating Chen and his wife.
BNSF said workers get a fair shake. Plaintiffs' attorneys have described the system as a "kangaroo court.'' They see it as an easy way to build a case against workers, helping the railroad defend itself if workers ever sue over an injury.

Rookie Division
The game might as well have ended after the first quarter, which the Lakers ended with a 14-4 run to take a 27-14 lead. The advantage grew to 24 points in the second quarter and the Lakers (7-0) coasted from there.
The other problem comes with the casting. Angelina Jolie as a high-kicking CIA agent who may be a double agent? (Or is that triple agent?) That’s easy to take, particularly when she dyes her hair Morticia-black and starts racking up the body counts. (In the film’s boldest bit of estrogen power, she improvises a field dressing out of a Kotex.)

At the dogleg left 13th, Mickelson ripped a 6-iron to the upper shelf of the green, leaving himself a long putt up a slope with a sharp left to right break at the end.

"Everybody along the food chain wants their money," Sopko said. If Chrysler stops paying a top-tier supplier, that company could go out of business and stop buying his products.
Pundits, writers and many others have had a lot to say about Lake Ridge Academy over the last few months. We wanted to take a moment and set the record straight for the sake of not just the school, but also for the sake of some terrific girls that just recently joined our community.
The typical barley wine is a winter drink, sweet, malty and potent. The contrarian Santa Barbara outfit Telegraph Brewing produces an eccentric version that stretches the definition by being made with rye malt rather than barley. Telegraph even refers to it as a rye wine; probably a category with only one member.
Major League Baseball, Fox Sports and Jamie McCourt each raised concerns that they asked the court to consider on or before April 13, the day of the scheduled hearing to approve the Dodgers' sale. The concerns appear unlikely to derail the sale.

Until Friday, that is. That's when the Ohio Lottery pulled its ads from an Internet photo gallery that showed a shapely blonde woman undressing in stages -- fully clothed at first but with little left to the imagination by the 114th frame. The color photos have ads from various sponsors underneath them as well as in some of the sequential frames, just like TV shows have commercials.

The most common mistakes she sees parents making is trying too many different approaches to sleep training based on advice from friends and family without having a set plan in place. And, too often, parents blame themselves for their child's sleep troubles.
When Holmes and Adler get together, she greets him in the nude -- an attempt to rattle him -- and soon it becomes clear that this strong, sexy and very smart woman wants to engage the great detective in a spirited (and flirtatious) battle of wits.

It's planting season at 49er Farm, a 2-acre parcel Klasna and wife Tracy lease off Highway 193 in Cool, El Dorado County. More than 3,000 of his plants, germinated through the precarious winter and unanticipated early-spring downpours, need warm weather to take root, sprout and yield a bounty to sell at the couple's farm stand and a new weekly farmers market that soon will start in Cool.
So it's good to see Eric B. & Rakim on the ballot. They might not get in -- although why wouldn't they? -- but their nomination suggests that the Hall is willing to tell (at least) an attenuated version of the hip-hop story. Rapper Rakim and DJ Eric B. didn't have the chart hits that other rap stars would, but they've been cited as invaluable forerunners by almost every serious hip-hop artist of the last quarter-century. Rakim is, in a way, similar to 2010 inductee Tom Waits -- a dynamic storyteller and singular voice who pushed against the limits of his genre, and, in so doing, opened up territory for other creative voices. Eric B.'s aggressive sampling of James Brown and '70s funk changed the way hip-hop sounded. making it harder, denser, and groovier. Listening to "I Ain't No Joke" in 2011, it's amazing how modern it feels. Nearly everything that hip-hop would become in the '90s and '00s is present in its nascent form here. If it was my Hall of Fame, they'd walk right in.

On another front, the administration tried to build on the Democrats' favorable gender gap with women by dragging the Catholic Church into a controversy over insurance coverage for contraceptives. That blew up when a Democratic strategist and frequent White House visitor alienated stay-at-home moms by saying Anne Romney "never worked a day in her life." Romney used that to talk about how women are attuned to economic reality through daily household buying.

At Manino, Colton acts like a supreme assh--- (sorry for the language) and won’t even talk to Bill. Bill calls him a stuck-up brat. Colton then puts his own spin on things, and makes Bill out to be the villain. He then brings up offering to go to Tribal Council instead of the women. I think that boy’s cheese done slid off his cracker. The other men all think so too, but they also know that Colton has the personal Immunity Idol, and he’s running things a little bit. I can’t believe they are even considering this, and neither can the women.

"We knew the joke, the big joke, wasn't, 'He-he, vibrators' — it was really, 'Can you believe the idea of hysteria?'" Wexler said. "And the idea you'd have this young handsome doctor who could barely hold the hand of the woman he was courting in one scene then in the next scene he's in the office with his hand up a woman's skirt treating her, thinking it's like polishing furniture. To me that's what was always funny, the massive cultural denial, the delusion we could all be in."

For the Musiqa composers, the concerts are a vehicle for their own works. But Brandt says the ensemble's purpose goes further: "to present the best and most wonderful new music that's out there." Not everything the Musiqa has presented has been new, by anyone's standards: Joseph Haydn and Hugo Wolf have made cameo appearances. But most of the music Musiqa plays is from the 20th or 21st centuries - often by composers who are still alive.

And yet the whole point of insurance is to enable people to take responsibility for medical expenses that they can't predict or, potentially, afford. If someone knew today what treatments he would require, when he would need them and what the cost would be, he might be able to set aside enough money to cover those costs — assuming he was never fated to spend much time in intensive care or undergo complex surgical procedures. But no one has that kind of clarity about the future.

The standard sightseeing itinerary is short, usually ending with a pilgrimage to the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, established after the 1979 Vietnamese occupation.

Purges that filled Tuol Sleng began almost as soon as the communists took power, inspired partly by the paranoia of leaders such as Pol Pot and partly by the Cultural Revolution in China.

2. Stop Making Sense (1984): Sure, David Byrne will be remembered for his big suit, but this Jonathan Demme film captured the band in its absolute prime, and it also was the first film made using all digital audio technology.

Know the rules: Take the time upfront to decide how the pool will be run, and then put it in writing and distribute copies to everyone. This doesn't have to be overly complicated. Some basics to consider: What's the deadline for collecting cash? Who will hold the tickets? Will play be limited to certain people? What if Bill in accounting is out sick, and has Sara in sales cover for him when the money is being collected? Will they each receive their own share? Or will they have to split a single share? Some of these questions might seem nit-picky, but they could help fend off office drama, hard feelings and lawsuits if the pool strikes it rich.
