We found a single copy of Vilmos' book, "A Kaveforras" ("The Coffee Source") — on sale — at a bookshop called Alexandra on Andrassy Avenue, Budapest's Champs-Elysées. Coincidentally, the shop has one of Budapest's most ornate cafes on its upper floor. In Vilmos' time, the late 19th century hall, now occupied by Bookcafe Kavezo (kave is the Hungarian word for "coffee"), was part of a Parisian-style department store, so it's not mentioned in his book about coffeehouses, but the extravagant spirit of his gilded age is present in spades. Unfortunately, the neo-Renaissance murals, the gilded ceiling and the mirrored walls were more dazzling to look at than the pastries were tasty to eat.

The worst thing that could've happened to very promising young players like Castellanos was the meteoric rise of Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper. Washington took both first overall in amateur drafts 2009 and 2010. Both attained outrageous media attention for baseball prospects. Both were national magazine cover children. It's as though MLB wants its high draft picks getting the same amount of public fawning as their football and basketball counterparts.

Obviously, this payment scheme isn't a good one, but you can't necessarily blame the operators. It seems logical to pay for what you use, but in most states, only regulated public utilities are permitted to bill by the kilowatt-hour - something that's being challenged. Until that changes, public-charging providers must bill by session or time. After just one attempt it seems time would be the better way to go.
I leave it to the sensory scientists to explain this phenomenon, but a seemingly delicate sparkling wine can handle blue cheese, unless it is a heavily veined monster like Spanish Cabrales. With a more mellow and buttery blue, such as Ireland's Cashel Blue, Oregon's Rogue River Blue, French Fourme d'Ambert or Italian Gorgonzola dolce, sparkling wine is almost certain to please.

The win on DGB also carries extra symbolic power at a time when Mizzou is moving to the SEC. The SEC partners are measuring Mizzou, wondering how serious the Tigers plan to be about competing in the toughest conference in the land. Well, keeping the top in-state recruit home conveys strength. It just makes MU look good; this is great publicity. In the coming seasons, Pinkel will have to fight hard to keep recruits at home as SEC programs enter his territory to establish a base in Missouri. Pinkel won't win all of these battles but this was a big one. This was a start.

Democrats stand a chance of taking away a GOP seat here, where the incumbent Republican is retiring. With 87 percent of the vote counted this morning, lieutenant governor Brian Dubie was trailing by one percentage point to the Democratic candidate, Peter Shumlin. The hitch in Vermont is that there are five other candidates (including one who wants Vermont to secede), and if no one gets at least 50 percent of the total vote, the (GOP-run) state legislature gets to decide. As of this morning, Shumlin had 49 percent and Dubie 48 percent.

As a meat eater, I find there's an inverse relationship between how good something tastes and how guilty I feel about eating it.

Some Democrats wonder whether a back room deal will be reached where one of the candidates throws his support behind another. Lawyer Jim McDonnell and Cleveland City Councilman Kevin Kelley got the most votes at the earlier meeting of party leaders. An alliance there could result in a party endorsement and the free campaign help that comes with it.
The Internet can help you find love, and not just the eHarmony kind. It's a great way to get informed about diet and exercise — if one's cautious. We all need to learn how to separate the good information from the bad, just like life (hopefully) taught us to separate good relationships from bad ones.
When it won the 2003 Tony for best musical, John Waters' "Hairspray" was acclaimed for its warmth, its witty style and its embrace of a new generation of musical theater fans. It deserves all those accolades.

It depends on your situation. The bank's health is less important than your own personal financial health. If you are in a position to make your mortgage payments, you needn't be concerned if your bank fails. Even if the bank that holds your mortgage gets in trouble or fails, your mortgage obligations will still be obligations, and some other bank or financial institution will pick up your mortgage from the failed bank. You will have to continue paying your mortgage, but the holder of your mortgage might change.

Russian surgeon-poet Yury Zhivago's world is turned upside down with World War I followed by the Russian Revolution in this grand, epic adaptation of Boris Pasternak's novel, a love story set against sweeping events of history. The 1965 classic was nominated for 10 Oscars, including best picture, and won five.

Supporters say it's needed to protect the rights of employers with religious or moral objections to contraception.
A: Our focus right now is to get events going in other cities. With regards to the potential for future parades here, we're looking into that. And other events. For instance, on March 6, Brian Owens, the national recording artist formerly with Sidewinder, is having a concert at the Old Rock House in St. Louis and part of the proceeds will go to support the foundation. That's just an example. We plan on having other events to help the cause in the future. Right now, our focus is helping other cities to keep bumping up the level of awareness. That's important, because a small percentage of our population has been fighting our wars for us. We have a great responsibility as a society to show our appreciation for them and to take care of these people. But everybody has stepped up to the plate, and it's been really gratifying to see that happen.
I am fighting this fight because we have to be truthful about what we can’t afford—whether it is health and pension benefits which are out of line with the rest of the country, or a tunnel which we can’t pay for.
Two significant events for the Blazers this season happened against Dallas: In December, Aldridge found his season-changing groove against the Mavericks; and later, in March, McMillan realized he would have to change his “small” starting lineup for the postseason because he realized Gerald Wallace didn’t have the length to guard long forwards like Nowitzki.
Some companies were extremely selective and only hired candidates that exactly matched their needs, recruiters said. Other companies may not have been able to find candidates with the necessary skills.

Even more helpful are the exceptional first-grade teachers, Michelle Zamzow and Lori Marty, to whom I have been assigned. Each knows her student well, giving me tips as to the child's educational and emotional needs. In this way the child is recognized as an individual; he or she becomes much more than a name attached to a series of reading scores. I work with a personality, not just the skill gaps.

although summer is quickly coming to a close, it doesn't mean that everything fun and awesome has gone out the window. Fall brings us football, cool evenings to sit outside with a glass of wine, Halloween costume shopping, and ultimately, the joy of not sweating the moment you step outside. Living in the Midwest, we know that this joyous break in weather can be short-lived, bookended by intense heat and borderline devastating ice storms, so fitting it all in can be a challenge.
U.S. stocks yesterday snapped a five-day rally in which the S&P 500 climbed 5.6 percent, the biggest weekly advance since July 2009. Last week’s gain helped the S&P 500 erase about 75 percent of the decline suffered since reaching its high for the year on April 29. Through June 24, U.S. equities had fallen for seven of the previous eight weeks on concern the European debt crisis would spread and the U.S. economy slow. The index is up 6.5 percent for the year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

What a missed opportunity! What an exciting place Detroit could be with a thriving movie industry. What a magnet for creative, energetic young men and women willing to invest their talents here.
Roosevelt establishes wage and price controls as part of the nation's emergency response to World War II. Businesses can't attract workers with higher pay so instead they compete through added benefits, including health insurance, which unexpectedly grows into a workplace perk. Workplace plans get a boost the following year when the government says it won't tax employers' contributions to employee health insurance.
Movie memorabilia collector Ira Resnick has had the same dream for years.
I rest my case.
Instead they are automating. A $500,000 computerized machine replaces skilled workers who cut cloth with minimal waste. The plant aims for bigger margins by producing more complex outerwear products for Columbia and other customers.
Jake Stoneburner is a good tight end, although he should have caught the touchdown pass from Joe Bauserman against Miami. Others had less successful careers. Cornerback Travis Howard from the '08 class was suspended for two games in the scandals involving a Cleveland booster. Speedy wide receiver and return man Lamaar Thomas transferred. Injury ruined what is probably the final season of defensive linemen Nathan Williams. Etienne Sabino took a redshirt season in the middle of his career and is a sometime starter at linebacker.
$24.) You don't see writing like this often, so infused with an intimate relationship to nature, certainly not in debut novels. It may be that with nature shrinking away from us, young writers don't marinate in the sounds, smells, colors and emotions that were once readily available. Whatever the reason, Sosin writes about Lake Superior as if it were a character, a parent, a lover, an enemy. Three stories are linked between the covers of "The Long-Shining Waters": Grey Rabbit, an Ojibwe woman living on the shores of Lake Superior tries to protect her children from starvation, even as her dream life warns that they will die; Gunnar, a Norwegian fisherman living on the lake in 1902 with his beloved wife, Berit, is haunted by the discovery of a dead man in the lake; and Nora, a middle-aged woman whose business on the shores of the lake burns down in 2000 takes a journey around its perimeter. A single thread joins them through history; their stories link in the novel's subconscious like a fable. "Superior should be comprehensible," Gunnar thinks as he reluctantly leaves the body in the lake so as not to frighten Berit. "It's not. And that discord is readily felt. The Great Lake is movement at peripheral vision. It is sound at the limit of audible frequency. It is the illusion of the ability to understand."
(4) Michigan over (13) Ohio – Michigan won a share of the Big Ten regular-season title, while Ohio has been a pre-tournament darling of the upset prognosticators. But for Obama, there’s a key fact: The Wolverines are from Mitt Romney’s native state, and it still looks like the Republicans eventually will make Romney their nominee, even if they don't always demonstrate their elation at the polls. Maybe that's what Obama meant when he said, “Michigan looks good.”

Swanson accused the consulting firm of using heavy-handed, even illegal, tactics to pressure Fairview patients for payments before, during and after their hospital stays -- sometimes at their most vulnerable moments.
MSU still is potent, and nobody should doubt Izzo in March. But the Dawson injury could derail Michigan State in both tournaments this month. If that happens, the Spartans might feel like they never got proper recognition. But they did win a championship. And I hope that someday they allow themselves to enjoy it.
øWhen talking about fast-growth companies, you're likely to picture a technology start-up zooming from zero to billions: a Google, Facebook or Twitter. But fast growth also can sneak up on long-established small businesses in nontech fields.
In addition to knowing the symptoms of colon cancer and receiving a colonoscopy when applicable, your day-to-day routine also impacts your chances of developing colon cancer. By not smoking, limiting alcohol consumption, exercising regularly and eating a diet high in fiber, fruits and vegetables, you can take an empowered stance in looking out for your colon not only in March, but throughout the entire year.
A spokesman for Weihai's commerce agency said he knew of no citywide seizures but said local offices might be investigating sales or collecting evidence. He refused to give his name.
“When you're playing that well, you tend to push the door open for yourself,” he said. “Where he is right now is where he needs to be. If he continues to play at that level, eventually you're going to open up a spot for him. When it's going to happen, nobody can really say right now.”
Still, he was "smokin'" when he arrived at the Giro last month, one of cycling's three Grand Tours, like pro golf's four major tournaments. The Giro is every bit as challenging as the Tour, but it's more dangerous. So dangerous that Armstrong and others protested one of the stages this year.
"In that role, he took the lead in planning and directing efforts to murder innocent Americans," Obama told reporters in Washington, saying al-Awlaki plotted the Christmas 2009 airplane bombing attempt and a foiled attempt in 2010 to mail explosives to the United States.
Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks, opened in 1998 as Bank One Ballpark and is owned by the Maricopa County Stadium District. The ballpark, which has a retractable roof, air conditioning and a grass field, is for more than just sports. It's used for many events, including weddings, high school proms and technology events. The ballpark, 401 E. Jefferson St., was built with a quarter-cent sales tax, but that ended in 1997. All improvements have been funded with revenue generated by the district.

To Meksin, "House Coat" is many things - a metaphor for the immigrant experience (Meksin was raised in Russia), an allusion to shipbuilding (the panels of cloth are roped together like sails) and an exploration of the gender divide.
"I never question what my velocity is," he said. "I never know what it is. We really don't keep track of that one for me, anyway. Just kind of a mind game that I don't play."

It would be wrong to blame the impending sweep (or five-gamer) entirely on Stoudemire, however. Certainly, those of us in the typing pool are justified in our disapproval, because polite breeding teaches us that he should know better than to bleed all over Pat Riley’s carpet.
A petition must be filed with the court requesting the appointment of a guardian. Medical evaluations by two physicians are necessary to establish the person’s condition. Notice is given to all next of kin who have a right to participate in and/or be appointed by the proceedings. The Court will appoint an attorney to represent the proposed incompetent person who will prepare a report to the court. A judge will hold a hearing to determine if a guardian should be appointed and who the guardian should be. Once appointed, the guardian must post a bond.

With windows facing the Pacific Ocean, sunsets at Kinda Lahaina have been an attraction for some customers. The Angus-beef burgers a mainstay for others. Breakfasts were a favorite - from the avocado, bacon, cheese omelets to the huevos rancheros.
I'm not rolling out the Pollyanna/Chamber of Commerce speech. But it's important to dial down the whining and the discontent. Since everybody keeps score, it's important to note that there will only be one national champion in 2011, and the other teams are going to have to look for some other positive mojo while reflecting on the season.

There were thousands of saloons, many no more than fetid cellars, and grinding poverty. And those were only the most obvious ills. Swindlers, hustlers, pimps, cutthroats, con artists, derelicts -- the place was a hive of the most sordid and base activities. The cops were virtually all on the take, as were the Tammany Hall politicians. When upstanding New Yorkers launched an effort to take back their city, they were thwarted at all turns by crooked judges. Enter Roosevelt, an ambitious young reform Republican eager to make a name for himself.
But as Diane Bonagura and Mary Jane Contino scheduled their trip to a local Home Depot, it changed from a simple journey to create birdhouses to a trip that would end up shaping much more than just a couple pieces of wood.

West, the Pacers' best offseason acquisition, scored 12 points in the third quarter on 6-of-9 shooting to help them go from leading by two at the half to being up 12 heading into the fourth quarter.

I hear warnings not to "rush to judgment" in the Martin case, yet I find myself wondering: When is the last time I saw anyone who is not black look at one of those episodes where the justice system failed African-American people -- look at Trayvon; look at Jena, La.; look at Tulia, Texas; look at Amadou Diallo; look at Abner Louima -- and say, unprompted and unambiguously, that thus and so happened because of race?

And yet, as a serious wine, Grenache is on a star turn. Our tasting of about 30 bottles - not to dismiss the charms of Rhone-style blends, but we limited ourselves to wines labeled specifically as Grenache - yielded the most auspicious tasting in months. It is a grape that has done well in the two cooler vintages of 2009 and 2010, and the less oak and heavy-handed winemaking it receives, the more it seems to reward its maker. What's not to like?

M lived in the Bronx and I lived in Manhattan so it took him a while to travel from his home to mine. We left and took a couple of buses to the Empire State Building, a place I had never before been. We took the elevator up to the viewing floor and looked over the city from above. Surprisingly, his father was there. I'm not sure why but it seemed as if he was checking me out.

The idea that the sale and use of drugs should be illegal largely arose in the first half of the 20th century, when we had little understanding of the science of addiction. Then, and even now to a large degree, the abuse of drugs is seen as a moral failing - a bad exercise of free will.

The National Institutes of Health defines drug addiction as "a chronic, relapsing brain disease that is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, despite harmful consequences." The NIH goes on to say, "It is considered a brain disease because drugs change the brain - they change its structure and how it works."
