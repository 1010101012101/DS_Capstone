In the middle, I set a cap of $75, which pencils out to $15 per person - no more out of line for a special meal than choosing a free-range turkey over a freezer bird. While the midrange can be a minefield of serviceable but meaningless wine, these bottles should make you feel like a billionaire, Travie McCoy-style.

Went the Day Well followed a similar path to Animal Kingdom, breaking his maiden just a few weeks before winning the Turfway Spiral and proving to Motion and the ownership group, Team Valor International, that he was worthy of a Derby trip. His development was slowed earlier this year when, upon being shipped to Florida after being purchased in Europe, Went the Day Well was quarantined for two weeks. That put Motion's training behind, and he's taking the unusual step of having the colt race with blinkers on for the first time Saturday.

What happened: The subprime mess is mostly a domestic issue, but it has shown up in a few other nations, including Britain. Dozens of foreign banks and investors took big stakes in U.S. mortgage securities. More fundamentally, many believe aggressive foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, especially by the Chinese, kept interest rates here artificially low while the crisis was building. That may have allowed more borderline borrowers to qualify for mortgages and encouraged speculation in general. Those purchases were made possible by China's big trade surplus with the United States.

While your stellar "Watchdog" reporters have done excellent work ferreting out local graft and corruption, I am less than impressed by the non-scandal that has been uncovered involving our port operations. Your in-depth investigation seems to have discovered that business has dropped off at our port facilities since the start of the recession -- hardly surprising and barely newsworthy. It does appear, though, that the U-T has embarked on a peculiar crusade to convince readers that the port operations are suddenly unworthy of the waterfront land that they currently occupy (particular emphasis on the 10th Avenue terminal). Not surprisingly, this effort coincides with the U-T's quixotic proposal for a billion-dollar football stadium/sports complex at the very site currently occupied by the port terminal. The U-T reportage keeps referring to a supposed debate over the viability and civic value of our ports vis-à-vis a sports facility, but in reality there is no evidence of such a debate among key players in San Diego. The U-T should let the Watchdog reporters do what they do best and stop ginning up phony scandals in a fruitless attempt to sway public opinion.
Jakub Voracek made a nice pass from along the boards to Briere and he busted free alone on the open ice for the breakaway goal in the second. Van Riemsdyk knocked in a rebound and gave the Flyers a 2-1 edge only 37 seconds later. Van Riemsdyk stamped himself as a franchise cornerstone last postseason when he scored seven goals in only 11 postseason games and earned a $25.5 million, six-year contract extension. But he scored only 11 goals in 43 games in a season derailed by a broken left foot and a concussion.

I have realistic solutions to being fashionable. Don't make excuses about time, money or your diet or size. Fashion is everywhere; you don't have to spend tons of money. Ready-to-wear sizes might not fit exactly, so get things altered. There are great jeans out there for 20 bucks; they're just as nice as the ones costing $120. It takes patience to build a good wardrobe. Be creative, get out of your comfort zone, try things on. Know what flatters you. Inventory your closet, get rid of worn-out stuff and try to create new outfits. I'm not a clotheshorse anymore. Now I'm financially conscious, and I know that I can be creative and versatile with what I already have.

Conventional spyware is a piece of code that invisibly tracks a user's movements and habits without his or her knowledge, and silently reports what it learns back to an evil enterprise (which we can define as anything from "A Russian crime syndicate" to "Facebook"). Prey is a special kind of "white hat" spyware that lies dormant and never tracks a device's legitimate user. But when your hardware is stolen, you can remotely activate Prey and it'll begin to invisibly and regularly report the hardware's location, and the thief's activity, back to you. Prey isn't designed to make your life miserable; it's designed to help you get your gear back.

Traumatic brain injuries contribute to a substantial number of deaths and permanent disabilities -- disabilities you can see and ones you can't. While brain injuries are underreported, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that each year 1.7 million people sustain a traumatic brain injury; 52,000 people die and 275,000 are hospitalized. TBIs contribute to a third of all injury-related deaths in the United States. The numbers are rising fast, given how much more we know about sports injuries and with our troops in war-torn places. Last month, in a news conference about Brain Injury Awareness Month, the Pentagon estimated that as many as 360,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans may have suffered brain injuries. Among them are 45,000 to 90,000 veterans whose symptoms persist and require specialized care.

Mark still is struggling with the dance, heat exhaustion and a general unease of seeing a dream for $1 million fading away. After each unsuccessful attempt, Booper encourages him to quit, and after his 11th attempt, Mark gives in. He feels like his health is at risk and says his three children are more important to him than the money. He goes to change, but Bopper follows him and asks him to give it one more try. His dancing coach tells him that he'll get the clue if he dances just one more time, and so Mark musters all the strength he has left and dances for the 12th time. It's not perfect, but it's good enough and everyone cheers for him. We tear up. It's quite the moment.
Senait Gebregzhiabher, the head of the aid agency Oxfam in Somalia, applauded the end of the famine, especially that "125,000 children no longer face severe malnutrition," but warned that the international community "must not be complacent" and that gains made so far could easily be reversed.
It's difficult to believe that the NFL draft (which began in 1936) was almost a throwaway TV show when it premiered in April 1980. Chet Simmons, the ESPN president at the time, asked NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle if his 6-month old network could televise the draft. Rozelle's legendary reply: "Why would you want to do that?"

The poster was released around the same time as the "Charlie's Angels" premiere, and together turned Fawcett into a phenomenon. She wasn't a classic beauty like "Angels" co-star Jaclyn Smith, nor (at the time) the acting talent of "Angels" lead Kate Jackson, but something about her Southern California look -- inviting yet oddly wholesome, playful and down to earth -- on both the show and the poster spoke to that moment in time. "Angels" was an enormous hit from the start, and thanks to the poster (still one of the best-selling ever), Fawcett became its breakout star.
A far cry from the typical taverna, this corner BYOB near Washington Square is a heartfelt homage to the authentic Cypriot-Greek flavors of Konstantinos Pitsillides’ island home, with an emphasis on soulful game stews (goat, rabbit, venison), grape-leaf-wrapped fish, and ancient grains, like the trahana wheatberry goat’s milk soup from my most recent visit.

“The original bill had no safeguards whatsoever,” Heise said. “It was pretty much a free-market option. We have much more accountability and more oversight. The ultimate bill is, I think, a decent compromise between the different factions.”
The Senate's 38-20 vote Tuesday came a day after the House approved its own stadium bill. A conference committee will work out differences, and the Vikings are already on record against the House version for a $105 million hike in the amount they would pay.

Unlike say, a bowling league, where everyone competes at once, the archery league is flexible. Participants can come when they want. They shoot 60 arrows (plus up to 10 practice shots), record their score and go home. In competitions, there's the extra pressure of a time limit, but the league participants often take breaks to rest, adjust their equipment, get tips from the store's staff -- and eat pizza.

"Once he took over, the first thing to do is to make sure the team is together and they all have the same goals," Scott said. "I'm not saying they didn't have that goal with Mike D'Antoni. But I think Woody stepped into a very tough situation, and he's done an excellent job, especially on the defensive end.

We tried two more pizzas, both with great toppings, but never found the tender chewy crust of the kid's pie. Fruity tomatoes and lots of fresh mozzarella in the margarita ($15) proved too wet for the much larger crust. And our simple mushroom ($17), a gluten-free version, was good for its kind - neither too gummy nor crackery - but the sturdy crust was a bit distracting.

Although the sinking of the Titanic has figured in TV period pieces from "Upstairs, Downstairs" to Fellowes' "Downton Abbey," the last time the disaster got miniseries treatment was in 1996, when CBS rushed a two-night drama starring George C.

Despite an appearance by Catherine Zeta-Jones as a heroic passenger, the miniseries was generally panned.

If you've listened to James throughout these playoffs, he hasn't exactly seemed in harmony with his head coach. He brought up J.J. Hickson getting more minutes against Chicago.

In the 1960s, he wrote an exposé for Newsday about urban planner Robert Moses's foolhardy plan to build a bridge across Long Island Sound from Rye, N.Y., to Oyster Bay, Long Island.

La Russa gave Felipe Lopez Thursday's start at shortstop but wasted little time lifting him for Brendan Ryan after the Cardinals took a 5-3, fourth-inning lead. Lopez threw late to first on Ian Desmond's second-inning infield single, then threw over Pujols' head for a third-inning error that led to three unearned runs against Chris Carpenter. Ryan has typically started behind Carpenter, but La Russa noted before the game that a matchup against Nationals righthander Jordan Zimmermann prompted him to start the switch-hitter Lopez. ...

The game will be played at Sun Life Stadium at the start of a road trip that takes the club to Pittsburgh and Chicago. The Cardinals will play 44 games in the season's final 45 days.

Noting that Kawai's granddaughter, Leslie Kawai, was named 1981 Rose Queen, Hirahara says that "after doing the research for the article, I realized — especially with the addition of the teahouse, which was given by the Pasadena Buddhist Temple — the Huntington represents a century-long arc of Japanese American history in this area."

Made legal by virtue of two U.S. Supreme Court rulings, the groups allow the rich to make an end run around the old campaign finance rules.
Russo said the transfer is not “routine,” like Mayor Dawn Zimmer said in her proposal. Russo said the items for transfer, which include $233,000 in legal fees, were not entered into the budget, so it cannot be simply moved because the amount was not figured into the budget when it was proposed.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he didn’t see any reason to second-guess the NYPD’s methods. He was responding in Albany to a letter sent by a civil rights group demanding a meeting to discuss the attorney general’s decision not to investigate the department.

Previously, the corps had insisted it would need until late 2015 to recommend a permanent fix -- a timetable challenged by five states in a federal lawsuit and legislation proposed in Congress. Critics say faster action is needed as huge, aggressive carp that have infested the Mississippi River and many of its tributaries bear down on the lakes, where they would gobble up food needed by native species and further disrupt ailing ecosystems.
It opens with Pinkett-Smith's mother saying to Willow, whose head is nearly shaved clean and what little hair she has is dyed magenta, "You know, Jada did not have the kind of life that you have now. I was not a good mother."
The good: Griselda's has successfully taken Tex-Mex to the state buffet line. A frequent customer at Griselda's told me that the pozole (a Mexican stew offered only on Mondays) is terrific. Ditto for the great greasy-spoon breakfast burritos. Torey was pleased with the amount of food on her plate: "Good portions but not monster size." The carnitas was tender, moist and "very spicy," she said. Jon's burrito was about as big as his two fists, and the carnitas virtually melted in his mouth. Spicy? You betcha, but not the sweat-inducing spicy that can make you wish you could disconnect your tongue.

Thapedi's opponent, Bobby Joe Johnson, has no political record, but he's not a newcomer to local politics. A 2011 attempt to run for alderman in the 6th Ward was stymied, and he did not appear on the ballot. Similarly, two previous bids to defeat Thapedi, in 2008 and 2010, were derailed when the Illinois Board of Elections invalidated his petitions, citing an inadequate number of valid signatures. Johnson did not return the Chicago Sun-Times candidate questionnaire.

Mr. Currie's conduct, and the parade of public officials who have been speaking up on his behalf, casts a pall on the entire state government. The first order of business when the Senate returns to Annapolis in January should be his removal from the General Assembly. There should be an explicit public record of which members of the Senate consider his behavior unacceptable.
"For them to open the door the way that they opened the door for me when I got here, I was a guy coming off my 13th year and a lot of people were saying I should retire them. They opened the door and said, Listen, this is your home, and gave me free reign to be me," Dawkins said in a 30-minute farewell news conference. "They gave me that opportunity to come here and just be, and it's been a blessing to be able to play for another organization that, to be honest with you, I feel loved me."

1) Tlaxcala (1.1 deaths per 100,000): Mexico's safest state is also its smallest, tucked just east of Mexico state like a notch in Puebla's side, with the Sierra Madre Oriental dominating its eastern boundary. It is an agricultural state with a significant tourism industry made up mainly of Mexican visitors and a smattering of history-minded German, French and Swiss travelers. Its primary attractions, barely known to U.S. tourists, are precolumbian archaeological sites such as Cacaxtla and colonial architecture in and around the capital city of Tlaxcala. The state has more than 1,000 archaeological sites, only seven of which are open to the public. It's tailor-made for travelers hankering for an authentic cultural foray safely removed from the hordes.

He prepared them for the difficult zone defense of No. 1 seed Syracuse, guided them to a halftime tie despite foul trouble for star Jared Sullinger and saw them lock down the win at the foul line after point guard Aaron Craft fouled out with 48 seconds to play.

Her audience, which was made up mostly of retired teachers, was delighted to be aboveground. These were her halcyon days. I saw some good shows at Illinois Theatre Center over the years — "Shadowlands" with David Perkovich, a fun revue called "Living the Dream: America in the 1950s," a memorable "All My Sons" in 2000, complete with Marilynn Bogetich, a "Bubbe Meises" production starring Billig herself.

Moving on to Michele Bachmann vs. Howard Baker (I'm sorry I couldn't help myself.) Baker served in the U.S. Navy, was elected to the U.S. Senate, was asked to serve on the Supreme Court by Nixon, and served two terms as Senate minority leader. He later received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and inspired the formation of the Howard H. Baker, Jr. Center for Public Policy at the University of Tennessee. Could you see Michele Bachmann being nominated for a Presidential Medal in the near future?! Of course, some people might say, to be fair to Bachmann, Baker has never claimed to cure anyone of homosexuality.

Still, it's a stretch to call U-Theatre a dance troupe. While Portland Taiko fans will find a kindred spirit in this company's polyrhythmic thunder, audiences expecting an evening of dance will encounter performance more akin to musical theater. U-Theatre's movement vocabulary is primarily limited to big turning leaps, martial arts combat poses and Tai Chi-style flow. But while the vocabulary may be narrow, its execution is masterful. The leaps, particularly, are performed with a precision unison that's increasingly rare on the modern dance stage, the dancers simultaneously wielding long sticks and punctuating the action with extraordinary synchronism on the drums.

The least expensive available flight in the "Economy Super Saver" category cost $312, but it wasn't immediately clear whether that was one-way or round-trip. Moving to the next screen, I found options for my return flight: The least expensive was $835. Ouch. The third screen generated a subtotal -- $1,148 -- and then added taxes for a grand total of $1,179.

The Pirates' key issue is to protest ACTA, the Anti-Counterfeiting-Trade-Agreement, which the United States negotiated with the European Union and a number of other countries. The Pirates organized anti-ACTA-protests as early as mid-2010 to fight for copyright reform and better protection of online rights. The party fears the alleged limitation of informational freedom on the Internet will become widespread once ACTA goes into effect. Consequently ACTA-protesters have staged quite impressive and numerous demonstrations.

There is the fight to deny that life must end. Many physicians as well as family have not been taught that dying is not failure. Often "doing everthing" does not mean prolonging a life, it means prolonging the dying process and the pain and suffering. To die on life support means being unable to talk, having one's hands tied down (to prevent pulling tubes) and being sedated. This keeps the patient calm-but unable to have any meaningful interactions with family or anyone!

Shadow's latest release, "The Less You Know, the Better," out now on the jazz label Verve, sees the 39-year-old record hoarder dabbling in exotic folk, heavy metal and the moody brand of hip-hop that made him an international sensation in the first place.
