I'm not sure this understudy from Akron -- the original sits near Canal Park -- fills the bill in a culinary way. Not all dishes I tried rated a standing ovation. But there are critical things it does right: Offers a park-once option for dinner and show; serves food with a user-friendly Italian slant; charges moderate prices; fills the plate; and works its tail off to get you to the show on time. And get this: It's open until 1 a.m. many nights for after-show dining.

Lowell Arye, executive director of the Alliance for the Betterment of Citizens with Disabilities, a lobbying and advocacy group for community home providers, said housing options outside of institutions are slim because the state has for too long pocketed the federal Medicaid reimbursement that comes from providing community housing. In fiscal year 2007, for instance, the state received $194 million in federal funds. Yet Treasury officials allowed only $50 million over three years to be used to support and expand community housing. "The other $144 million were used by the state for other purposes,'' he said.

"They are mad for classicism," Kenny says of the day’s fine furniture buyers. "The whole emphasis is on classical antiquity." A refined woman of means would select furniture to remain fashionable among her peers, and that often meant a desire to be transported to the idealized past of the Greek and Roman empires, thus the term Empire furniture.

"Shall we commerce?" asks one of the prostitutes in "House of Pleasures." It is a standard question routinely posed to the men who frequent L'Apollonide, a Paris brothel circa 1900. Commerce is the key word, as the evening assignations have little to do with romance, sensuality or intimacy. It's all about money and power, the women having very little of the former and none of the latter.

The association does rely on the help it gets from the city, however. The city donated $10,000 this year, and it added the float on its insurance policy, as is customary. Neilson said that the $10,000 is only a small addition to the approximately $100,000 that the association raises each year, and that 52-foot floats comparable to La Cañada’s can cost up to $300,000 when fully paid for as a city float, as has been the practice in Glendale.

Take “Elis,” a number dedicated to his daughter that came later in the performance. It began as a heartfelt waltz, where Bonilla’s orchestration made five players sound like 10 and where Renta scored with a boisterous soprano solo.

As soon as I got in I wanted to show him that I could play and I felt that I meant something to this team.

Over the past couple of games, he’s definitely got me to play harder. Now looking back I’m 100% glad he made me do that.”

“Somebody I’ve read said, ‘Oh, he wasn’t some heroic man of action.’ And I go, ‘Oh really?’ He went to West Point. He was kicked out, but he was there. He got in. And he was a swimmer. It’s not a stretch to think of him trying to solve a mystery, a series of crimes. He had an analytical, mathematical mind. You can see that in the writing. He called it ‘rationation.’ But basically, he invented forensics in his fiction.”

I started my blog in 2007 as a way to engage Oregon State economics students outside of the classroom setting. I was enthusiastic about the possibility of using new social media to bridge the gap between the classroom and the everyday lives of students. I thought this could in some way make economics more relevant, more alive and more interesting for them and in so doing, make them better economists. It also quickly became a way for me to engage in my own personal interests: looking at the world through the lens of economics and thinking about policy matters from an economics perspective.

Silatolu has rare quickness and all-around athleticism. He played tackle at a small school and will need to switch to guard.

In better times, this notion could be gently dismissed as a well-intentioned but impractical strategy for addressing our environmental challenges.

(And opinions are how I make my living.) I would say "It all depends," which is a choice pollsters never give you.

To obtain the rates, 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages required payments of 0.7 percentage point and 0.8 percentage point, respectively. Five-year and one-year adjustable rate mortgages required an average payment of 0.6 percentage point. A point is 1% of the mortgage amount, charged as prepaid interest.

My 13 years within the St. Edward High School community have been filled with, literally, thousands of blessings. I want to express my deep and abiding gratitude to each of you, especially to our students past and present, who have been a constant source of true hope in my life. At this moment, I also need to publically express my gratitude and love to my spouse, Mary, for her understanding and support over my years at St. Edward. She has been a constant companion to hundreds of our community events over the years, as well as being a great listener in some wee small hours.

First, the researchers sequenced Snyder's genome — the 6 billion letters of his DNA blueprint — several times over, to assess his risk for various conditions. (And they sequenced Snyder's mother's genome as well, to learn which genes he got from each parent.) They drew Snyder's blood regularly to see how proteins, RNA and a swath of other chemicals in his body increased or decreased when he was in good health and bad — his "omics" profile. They monitored his immune system and other health measures.
Much of the money at issue was funneled to Andrew Young, a former campaign aide once so close to Edwards that Andrews initially claimed paternity of his boss's illegitimate child.

Other than that, it seems you're better to stick with Guinness and play around with the tan variable. Although Bass Ale claims to be the original "tan," I got more dramatic color contrast from the lighter-hued Harp's lager (also a Guinness product). Another time-tested favorite is Smithwick's, the classic Irish pale ale. Also try Kell's Irish Lager from Oregon's Rogue Brewing. Depending on your taste, you could employ a highly hopped India pale ale like Bridgeport IPA, a West Coast pale ale like Sierra Nevada's or just a plain old American lager like Sam Adams.

4 "To Cork or Not to Cork" (Scribner, $26) Corked wines may be as annoying as the 49ers' standing this year, but George M. Taber made a very important decision in writing his new book: He realized that a whole book about wine corks wasn't exactly potboiling stuff. So he focused on the people who spend their days squabbling over corks and the many other devices used to keep wine in the bottle. That keeps "To Cork" heavy on drama and light on jargon, and humanizes what could be a seriously wonky topic. Taber's last book, "Judgment of Paris," is set to become a movie; will a double feature about screwcaps be next?

3. Run those fans. Make sure to leave fans on for 15 minutes or more after showering in order to remove the moisture that causes mold (which degrades air quality and contributes to asthma and other respiratory symptoms). If you don't have a fan in the bathroom, open a window after each shower to let in fresh, oxygen-rich air, which also prevents mold, Sherry suggests.

A dog park sketch, at Northeast Portland's Normandale Park, has potential, but the joke isn't really about dog park rituals; it's about Dave (Armisen) and Kath (Brownstein), the vest-wearing twosome whose self-absorption always makes them lecture others on how they should behave so as to make Dave and Kath happy. They're an obnoxious urban type, all right, but not my favorite ones to spend quality satirical time with. As with other Dave and Kath adventures, the sketch ends with them losing interest in the very subject they're obsessed with, as they walk away, leaving their dog with someone else.
When “The Simpsons” debuted in 1989, the course of animated television was forever changed — not only for the subject matter, but in the way music regained its prominence as part of the show. Matt Groening and Alf Clausen, the creator and composer for the series, respectively, brought aspects of live-action musical moments into the cartoon world. These innovative minds opened the door for an entirely new generation of animated series.

One of the misfortunes of successful modern women -- at least so the occasional sociologist or magazine writer asserts -- is that they intimidate men of comparable social standing. Kate Hardcastle could relate. Oliver Goldsmith's enduringly endearing 1773 comedy "She Stoops to Conquer" centers on the wealthy Londoner Charles Marlow, who is tongue-tied around the women of his own class, but confident and charming with common women. The well-bred Kate's solution: pose as a maid. That's just the start of the confusions and complications in what's long been regarded as one of the most clever and warm-hearted of all English comedies. The well-reviewed recent production from the National Theatre in London shows here in a high-definition recording for the series NT Live.

So what does all this mean to you? Obviously, hotel executives don't think twice about leveraging guests like you to improve their online reputations. But if it's happening to you, it's probably happening to tens of thousands of other hotel guests every day.

Sleepers have been known to suggest that a guilty conscience must be the culprit. But thoughts as morality-neutral and ethics-free as whether or not to use fabric softener can, in the dark of night, be urgent enough to keep the eyes on the ceiling.

The budget I recently submitted to the County Council included money for 62 additional teachers and funds the entire Board of Education request, minus nearly $34 million for employee raises. We cannot in good conscience fund raises for school employees when the most that can be done for other county workers is to end their furloughs. Last year, when county employees faced salary reductions for the second year in a row, the school board insisted on giving pay raises to school employees, in spite of the strong opposition of the administration and the council. The additional money sought by the School Board for fiscal 2013 is clearly for salary increases. The school officials will assert that they negotiated salary increases in "good faith," but how is it "good faith" when they were told prior to the negotiations that the county would not fund these pay increases?

Everyday in this country, millions of your fellow citizens use firearms lawfully and safely, and thousands daily use them for protection. If guns didn't work effectively, the police wouldn't want to carry them around. Naturally, the proper use of a gun is hardly newsworthy, so the understandable impression among non-gun-owners is quite negative when tragedies such as these capture the headlines. The simple fact is, there is a small number of deranged people out there and law enforcement can't protect everyone (even themselves) all of the time. If we spent more time focusing on the problem and less time proclaiming the need to reenact the federal assault weapons bans (see Atty. Gen. Eric Holder's remarks several weeks ago), maybe we can do something to ameliorate the problem. I bet we can; how about you, Paul?

Worse still is the twisted ethos of governance as a pastime-to-be-exploited that Blagojevich & Co. perpetrated — and that some of his survivors perpetrate to this day. You've read before our belief that citizens of this state are cheated as much by favors as by fraud. That for every Illinois pol who tried to sell a U.S. Senate seat, many others exploit citizens for personal or political gain. That the proven cost of conniving and clout in Illinois ranges from whose children get the choice jobs, too whose children get tuition waivers at state universities, to whose children get incinerated in the van wreck.
"My youngest son (Jon) said to me, ‘it'll be like (the movie) The Blind Side, mom,'" she remembered. "I said, ‘yeah, but he's not poor and black, and I'm not Sandra Bullock.' "

Similarly, Union City Mayor Brian P. Stack said the holiday shopping day "was negotiated as part of a contract by a previous administration." He said Union City is in the process of renegotiating the municipal contract to put an end to the practice.
Gaiman and Sarrantonio have sampled widely, and you're going to find names here you may not expect—Jodi Picoult, for instance—and others that you may, like Jeffrey Ford, Michael Moorcock and Peter Straub. But that's the point, right? These choices are meant to blur —or entirely erase—the lines usually separating genres. "Stories" is the perfect dark counterbalance to the smells of suntan lotion and barbecue smoke waiting for you this summer.
Saturday is expected to be mostly cloudy with a calm wind.
Most people never faced in waking lives the disasters they find in the exam dream. So why are circumstances in the dream so dire?
I've been at Madison for three years now and have experienced it first hand to know what this "underachieving" high school just off Southeast 82nd Avenue is really like.
"With the uncertainty because he's suspended indefinitely, it's hard to go out and offer somebody a job with the potential that (Williams) may get reinstated at the end of the year, and then he may not," Fisher said.
“Speed and shiftiness,” Shuler said when asked what he brings to the unit. “I want to be the speed guy of the group. We have really great receivers: Brandon Coleman, Tim Wright, Quron Pratt, Jeremy Deering, Mark Harrison. We all can do different things. We’re going to fit all of our talents into this offense.”

BOSTON -- When the Yankees placed Michael Pineda on the 15-day disabled list, they did so for two reasons. They wanted to rest his right shoulder, which the Yankees believed to be afflicted by minor tendinitis. And they hoped to give him a chance to mentally regroup after a difficult first spring training with the Yankees.
Chris Ronayne, president of University Circle Inc., said he's pitched the project to nearby University Hospitals as a potential home for nurses and other employees. Construction could start next month and finish in mid-2012.
Based on what coach Nate McMillan said during his pregame meeting with reporters 45 minutes before Miller's arrival, that means Miller will start against his former team.
Neither is intimidated by the mayor's manic passion for his job, and neither should be. When Cogen realized he was getting nowhere negotiating with Adams in private over funding of a new Sellwood Bridge, he took his frustration public, noting the mayor's "demands have become increasingly outrageous."
"The nonproductive times, the failure to meet objectives, and the outright failures are a pretty good indicator that things just aren't quite right," Pritchard said. "The rig schedule is a key driver that is really detrimental to safety overall and process safety in particular."

"It's a source of confusion for many employers," she said, and the law is hard to enforce because it's impossible to know why a person's job application was rejected.
Cunningham added 10 points, but made his biggest impact on the defensive end. He had two steals on the perimeter -- stripping Martin and taking it in for a dunk, then swiping the ball out of Luis Scola's hands and chasing the ball down. The steal resulted in an Aldridge basket, drawing the Blazers within 89-87.

Boyle on Thursday often referred to the this year's unseasonably warm winter in key Columbia global markets as he assessed the company's first quarter for investors and analysts.

The woman who called Fitzgibbons about the 2000 Dodge Durango was Darcel Gillespie, 27. The mother of three kids, 8, 2, and 3 months, supports her family on food stamps and a $9-an-hour nursing assistant job. She grew up in public housing. "Breaking into my car kind of set me back," said Gillespie, who lives in the 1100 block of Long Street.
Seattle fans will have to endure a nearly eight month regular season before getting to the meat of the matter. After three strong regular seasons, three U.S. Open Cup titles and three first-round playoff exits, the Sounders must awaken from their postseason nightmare. This team is good enough to challenge L.A. in a two-game series.
The decision caps a political career that started out promising for the lawyer who became the first Chinese American elected to Congress. But Wu displayed a bad temper, didn't play political ball with others, and had little to no political clout. By the time the 2010 election rolled around, his staff was begging him to seek psychiatric help for a host of erratic episodes.
Admission was free. Patrons were encouraged to dress in formal attire, and more than half of the crowd of more than 800 or so did just that. So did many of the people tending the bars. It made for a festive evening, despite the colliding styles of music.

Yet Brown criticized Republicans for the $670 million sum. He addressed Obama's matching budget request for $670 million only when a reporter asked why he was limiting his criticism to the GOP.
miss something new at Urban Chestnut. This midtown brewery had five beers available when it opened in January. As of last count, Urban Chestnut's what's-on-tap blackboard lists more than a dozen brews, from smoked ales and hoppy IPAs to traditional European-style lagers and a signature chestnut beer. Also of note: Brewmaster Florian Kuplent says he hopes to begin bottling this summer.
But it’s a different story in Europe, where GM lost $256 million, and South America, where earnings fell 8 percent to $83 million.
A federal judge blocked key parts of the law from taking effect but left in place a provision that makes it a crime in Arizona to stop a motor vehicle to pick up day laborers or for day laborers to get in a motor vehicle if either action impedes traffic. The law also makes it a crime to transport illegal immigrants if another crime is committed.
There's one recipe in particular in my book -- wagon-wheel pasta with pancetta and peas -- that she likes to make with me. I always say to people that frozen vegetables are a key to a fast weeknight meal. I have frozen edamame and frozen peas in it, so I really only need fresh sugar snap peas and a little bit of mint. Everything else I have in my kitchen. I always have pasta in the pantry, and I always have pancetta, which always adds a ton of flavor. You throw all that in a pan, and you've got food ready in about 15 minutes. If you can plan ahead and stock your pantry and freezer, you can make dinner faster at home than takeout.
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A former East Cleveland man sent to death row nearly three decades ago is scheduled to be executed on Nov. 15.
Methodology: Monthly city and CDP labor force data are derived by multiplying current estimates of county employment and unemployment by the employment and unemployment shares (ratios) of each city and CDP at the time of the 2000 Census. Ratios for cities of 25,000 or more persons were developed from special tabulations based on household population only from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For smaller cities and CDP, ratios were calculated from published census data.

Under the law, companies can set their own rates, even if it means providing fewer hours, and are paid based on invoices of oftentimes unverified hours and student sign-in sheets. They submit evaluations rating their own program's progress to the state; choose when and where to host their tutoring — including in homes and online; and hire tutors with qualifications of their choosing.
Huff was struck in the head by a liner from Alex Rodriguez today (Saturday) in the Bronx. I heard the Jim Rosenhaus call on WTAM while I was driving and later saw the STO replay. Both were scary in their own way.

Although the constitution, does indeed, give Congress the power to REGULATE interstate commerce, nowhere in that most precious document, does it say that Congress has the power to MANDATE such commerce.
King Kamenetz has so damaged his relationship with enough of his subjects that the revolt has started. In 1775 only a third of the colonists wanted complete independence, a third wanted to find a way to work out their differences and remain loyal subjects, and another third were undecided. Just as King George miscalculated with actions that alienated the undecided, King Kamenetz has likely done the same. The best that King Kamenetz can hope for is that his subjects have short memories, but somehow I do not think that the delegation, the County Council, and Baltimore County voters will be so forgiving.

Hey, Tony: I know it didn't make a difference in the end, but wasn't Hue Jackson's decision to go for it on fourth down instead of kicking the chip-shot field goal one of the worst you've ever seen?

After a friend sent him a box load of half-century-old mug shots from an abandoned prison in rural Georgia, Schiek evolved the idea of refashioning them as portraits. He re-photographed the tiny pictures and printed them, much enlarged, on paper with an unusually metallic finish that quietly evokes the "silver screen" of which many of the depicted prisoners appear to have dreamed. Schiek's treatment magnified the found images' physical imperfections: They now seem to symbolize whatever defects of personality or judgment landed the men in prison. The source prints' creases and scratches and their perforation by staples have also made scale in Schiek's photographs matter in ways it ordinarily does not.
The people are speaking up — in a way they have not before.

The state passed a new monitoring system for public schools in 1995, called the Quality Single Accountability Continuum. Every three years, districts must pass a detailed checklist in five areas: governance, fiscal management, personnel, instruction and operations.
Somewhere deep in the catacombs of Capitol Studios in Hollywood, Bethany Cosentino has found a little place of her own. It's squeezed into a tight corner in the control room of Studio B, where she sits behind an ancient synthesizer to relax or think or read her book, "Tusk," about the Fleetwood Mac album of the same name. The keyboard is her desk. She's never played it.

Democrats stuck to the message they have had since the map was rolled out Tuesday: slow down the process and consider changes to a map they consider overly partisan and textbook gerrymandering. Minority Leader Armond Budish, a Beachwood Democrat, said Republicans were "raising the specter of the judicial bogeyman as a scare tactic."
Senate President Steve Sweeney is sponsoring a bill that bars cities and towns from charging new fees for services such as garbage pickup to help stay within the mandatory tax cap lawmakers approved in 2010. The proposal would prohibit user fees from being shifted out of the property tax base.
But sources told CBSSports.com last night the league and players union are closer to a pact than they are publicly disclosing.

"I still want to run. I do," Izzo said. "But we've got to be smart. Probably if I look back on the zillions of mistakes I've made, the one that I've made stubbornly was the different times we played Carolina and (we) just tried to do it the same way each time and (got) beat by 20 each time. Sooner or later, don't put your hand back on the stove, because it's going to burn."
Lucas Gasco has been serving up superb Spanish food at this charming location for 15 years. His rustic Russian Hill restaurant features mostly small plates, but he breaks that tradition with excellent paella and a few other larger plates, including pork medallions in piquillo sauce. Top choices: shrimp sauteed with garlic; poached octopus; the restaurant's namesake, zarzuela (seafood stew); and crema Catalana for dessert.
But Malaysia Air's main union leaned on the country's politicians to squash the share swap because of concerns about cost cuts. Those fears were well-founded. Malaysia Air has been bleeding losses because of rising competition and soaring fuel prices. The tie-up was meant to reduce overlap between the two Malaysia-based carriers on some routes, cut expenses and help shore up Malaysia Air's balance sheet.
Because amount and intensity of exercise was self-reported, participants could have underestimated or overestimated their activity levels, which could have had an impact on the results, she said.
Yikes. A very pungent argument. It should be noted that Budweiser has not been "killed" - it's still one of the largest beer brands in the U.S. But it is indisputably on a long decline that shows no signs of easing. How much of that stems from Bud Light? It's a fair question.

Was it this person, or that person? Was it even someone from town, or just someone passing through? All kinds of rumors swept the town, as days and then weeks passed with no winner claiming the prize. On April 4, MotoMart was presented with a decent chunk of money - half a million dollars - just for selling the ticket, but still no winner. Winners who bought tickets in Maryland and Kansas claimed their prizes, but still no winner here.

Mooney, who grew up in Rock Lake, N.D., set his sights on running a pub while standing in London's Waterloo train station. World War II was on, and Mooney, a machine gunner, was on his way home after a German tank killed three of his buddies, tore out one of his eyes and left shrapnel in his skull.
It makes rational sense that such expressions might be hard-wired. We are an intensely social species, after all, and the business of letting others know what we’re feeling (or deceiving them about what we’re feeling) is important business. So is reading the emotions of others. Why would natural selection have left that aspect of human behavior alone?
Gregersen's sister Dorothy, 84, was in an elder-abuse situation in Chicago after suffering a massive coronary last December. Gregersen, whose father was a decorated World War I Army veteran , was put in contact with Operation American Patriot.
In fact, the high temperature has only eclipsed 80 in March a total of 17 times since the turn of the 20th century and only one other time on back-to-back days -- March 30-31, when it was 81 and 80.
Intermittent springs in the canyon also feed the mountains' wildlife. Observant hikers might see a black bear as it lumbers up the canyon wall toward the ruddy spires and curiously carved formations near the canyon's rim.

"Snow White & the Huntsman": As soon as "Mirror Mirror," the other Snow White movie, opened to mixed reviews that not even Julia Roberts as the evil queen could disguise, the focus shifted to this darker, action-adventure interpretation. This film gives Kristen Stewart a chance to shed her "Twilight" moping and play a strong young woman who takes lessons in how to be a warrior from a very handsome huntsman (Chris Hemsworth, a.k.a. Thor of "The Avengers"). In this edition, the merciless queen is Charlize Theron, who knows how to handle wicked torment (she won an Oscar for "Monster"). Expect a dazzling visual panorama from debut feature director Rupert Sanders (who cut his teeth making eye-catching ads) and a battle royal that would have the dainty Snow White from the Disney cartoon running for cover.

The "King Kam," as the hotel is known in Ironman lingo, faces sheltered Kamakahonu Beach, where two centuries ago the eponymous monarch built the Ahuena Heiau compound, his final home. The thatched-roof Hale Mana, carvings and steeple-like Anuu oracle tower, among other reproductions of buildings on the revered site, are just a few steps from Kailua Pier, where cruise ship tenders dock and 1,800 triathletes begin and end their 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile ride and 26.2-mile marathon. And for the past couple of decades, location was about the only thing the musty King Kam had going for it.

The play is fast, inventive, creative and very, very funny. It resembles the book in that it roughly follows the plot and has all the same characters -- but what Rick Elice has done is reinvent it all, and the two directors have realized his words and story into this constantly moving, uproariously funny two hours of magic. You leave the theater enchanted, and that is the most anyone (especially the authors) could ever ask for.

The goal is to have as many of the products used during the tournament made in Newark by as many different companies as possible, Cahn said. Already, he estimates 50,000 items are in production or waiting for delivery. The attention paid to Newark during the event — not to mention the significant visitor traffic and dollars — has local organizations excited about the attention. City officials estimate revenue from ticket sales, hotels, restaurant and travel could reach into the millions of dollars, but Newark Mayor Cory Booker has said the actual figure is "hard to calculate."

Winning back-to-back series in New York and Boston is actually a pretty big deal for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that this is still a fairly young team that is building confidence with each happy circumstance. The Yankees and Red Sox are not what they were in the early 2000s, but they will always be the teams that the Orioles measure themselves against...and the O's have measured up very well against them this year. Even during the disappointing three-game sweep the Yankees pulled off at Camden Yards last month, it was obvious that the Orioles were much more competitive.
And the biggest question, who will Emily protect — Amanda, who knows all of her secrets and is pretty much the only friend she had before this summer; or Jack, her first love who is completely innocent in all of this. I’d say odds are in Jack’s favor, but with all of his snooping around, he's bound to make this difficult.
"It's disappointing to our group as a whole because you want to set a standard for yourself to be consistent," left back Mike Chabala said. "It's been an issue and it's been something that is a recurring theme, and it's something that we have to get away from."

In the near term, Milwaukie and county representatives say they need to better understand why the rate negotiations heading for arbitration dissolved into such costly, legalistic chaos.

It urges building on the collaboration in the region's biotech industry with similar area-wide plans to grow information technology and advanced manufacturing. It suggests economic development groups focus more on growing startups and small firms and less on wooing big employers from elsewhere. It calls for more cooperation on worker training and better connections between rail, river and road transportation. And it proposes clarifying, and maybe redefining, the roles of area-wide groups like the Regional Chamber and Growth Association and the Bi-State Development Agency.

Romney is unlikely to go for that. At the same time, Paul’s backers recognize that selling supporters on an alliance with Romney carries special risks, since Paul’s bond with his backers is predicted on his record of principled stands. A pact would have to be done “very cautiously,” says Benton. “We wouldn’t ask our people to do that if we worried they were just being coopted or that we were in some way selling out.”

Everything - the handcrafted booths, vinyl stools and even the built-in phone booth which doubles as the diner business line - is just the way it was on his first day. Only the prices have changed. In 1960, the chili was 15 cents. Now it'll set you back $3.80 a bowl. It's a peek at what the American Dream - or at least Dinos' version of it - used to look like.
"Our third quarter sales growth reflects the previously reported increase in our Fall season backlog, as well as strong performance in our global direct-to-consumer business," Tim Boyle, Columbia's president and chief executive officer, said in a news release.

When the audience arrives, they are directed to an enclosed area that represents the film's diner. Everyone watches the first two scenes together. But from the moment Mr. Orange and Mr. White throw open the warehouse doors and enter bleeding and screaming, it's every man for himself. Or woman. Action breaks out everywhere — in the main warehouse, in the parking lot and in a loft. It's up to every wandering audience member where to direct their attention. So if you don't want to see that poor cop lose an ear, you can go check out what's happening out front. The action is so concentrated that, unlike the film's 100-minute run time, the whole thing here is over in an hour.

If you rank by which school does the most for the students it admits, Penn State dominates.

The time is now. We are in a position of power. No other cities are hiring and they're all cutting jobs, wages and benefits or planning to cut very soon. If the unions don't agree then we need to impose at least 10 percent in actual wage cuts this year and additional cuts in benefits.

The grand jury report called Sandusky the charity's primary fundraiser, and The Second Mile's annual reports show that some donations came from entities now involved in the scandal.
Skafte's character was meant as an observer, but his lack of engagement caused him to disappear in some sections.

True, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), under Texas Rep. Pete Sessions, is aware of the challenge and is energetically fund-raising and recruiting. True, the party is already coaching its newer members about the rigors of re-election. And true, John Boehner and Eric Cantor are going all out to collect money for their members.

PAC’s student actors all do a fine job of maintaining the piece’s absurdist humor. Stacy Downs is a very likable Tilly. If there is a flaw in her performance, it is that there is too much sweetness, too much perkiness, in her interpretation of the melancholic Tilly. She lacks the European-style, cosmopolitan world-weariness that might explain what the other characters find so sexually attractive and mystifying about her. From the start we get a bright-eyed, all-American innocence; however, when she becomes the happy Tilly midway through the play, Downs takes this bubbly girl-next-door quality to extraordinarily humorous extremes.

So I feel like the work I put in today and the work I would put in tomorrow, hopefully I would feel better and be ready for Sunday."

New thrills at Fantasy of Flight in Central Florida -- Fantasy of Flight in Polk County has added Wing WalkAir, an all-new outdoor attraction featuring an adrenaline- pumping, 600-foot zip line suspended four stories above water and a three-level ropes course with 33 midair challenges. Harnessed and tethered to the zip line, guests get to "fly" through the air a total of 600 feet, to the landing tower and back again, giving them double the chance to take in the scenery or to see it for the first time if they were too scared to open their eyes. Meanwhile, the ropes course tests participants' balance and bravery with a series of 33 elements to be navigated while tethered to an overhead line, including exercises that mimic walking a tightrope, balance beam, and horizontal and vertical ladders, all while suspended as high as four stories off the ground. Three levels of challenges offer something for children to adults, whether mildly adventurous to absolutely fearless. And, while zip lining or navigating the ropes course, guests will get a birds' eye view of Fantasy of Flight, scenic Lake Agnes and the rare and vintage airplanes on display on the tarmac. Regular, one-time admission for the zip line and ropes course is $22, or $15 for the zip line and $12 for the ropes course when purchased separately. Pricing is for children and adults and does not include 7 percent sales tax. Combo pricing is available with and without general admission included. Fantasy of Flight admission is not required for admission to Wing WalkAir. General admission is $28.95 for adults and $14.95 for children, ages 6-12, plus 7 percent sales tax. To participate, guests must be at least 48" tall or must be accompanied by an adult. All guests must be able to understand and follow safety rules as given by the safety personnel. The participant weight limit is 300 pounds and guests must be able to fit in the harness. Athletic shoes are recommended; no flip flops or loose shoes are permitted. The zip line and ropes course comprise only the first phase of Fantasy of Flight's Wing WalkAir attraction. Plans are underway for new additions to the area including a rock climbing wall and rappelling area to be installed this winter. Visit www.fantasyofflight.com.
