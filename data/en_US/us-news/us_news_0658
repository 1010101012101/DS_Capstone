Efforts to make a buck on the disaster are nearly as old as the disaster itself. The first film version, a silent short starring actress and actual Titanic survivor Dorothy Gibson, came out less than a month after the sinking. More than a dozen others have been released since, including James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster "Titanic," which has been re-released in 3-D for the centennial.

Despite a rough beginning to the season that included a 0-8 start on the road and an air of ongoing tension between Skiles and Stephen Jackson - which finally ended when Jackson was included in the trade with the Warriors, who subsequently sent him to San Antonio - the Bucks were beginning to play well just before the Bogut trade. Then they went on a run, winning four straight at the beginning of April to run their record to .500 and making the playoffs look like a realistic possibility.
Page 204: A juror asks whether police are trained to de-escalate the situation. Chamberlin answers: "I think that's always our number one goal in any situation. They got fancy words for it. Some people call it 'verbal voodoo.' Ideally, that's the way we would like every single call we go on to be." Police training emphasizes communication skills. "If we could talk every single person down that we encounter, whatever the situation, it would be fantastic."

Kaptur campaign spokesman Steve Fought said Wurzelbacher's references to Islam and Obama's middle name constitute "neo-birther code language."
But wait a minute: Taylor was a betting man. Indeed, for the 15 or so years he was absent from the music business -- from 1980 to the mid-1990s -- Taylor dedicated himself almost entirely (and with extraordinary success) to gambling. When he decided to give up gaming, it was because his original muse had been undeniably reanimated, and he has since re-emerged as a soulful, country-tinged singer-songwriter, standing shoulder to shoulder with such Americana icons as John Prine, Guy Clark and Lucinda Williams.
Oregon has taken a number of steps to reduce prescription drug abuse, and to do so in a way that honors the state's commitment to pain management. One is to approve a prescription drug monitoring program, a database that will allow doctors to track patients' use of certain drugs. The program should be up and running by early 2011, despite the state's budget crisis, because it's funded by provider dues.

Meanwhile, Small Bar owner Phil McFarland said he wanted to scale back operations to focus on the original Small Bar, 2049 W. Division St., which he continues to own. In addition to its reliably impressive beer selection, Small Bar has unveiled more ambitious food and cocktail menus during the last year that McFarland said he wants to further. The result will likely be more rare beer at Small Bar Division now that it doesn't need to share with another location.

Casual summer nuptials are the perfect fit for a white linen suit from Richard James, May said, highlighting just one of the many colors today’s grooms can choose. “Tuxedos have become a bit more diversified and we’ve been seeing some great play with the lapels and in colors like midnight blue, navy and white,” he said.

"We do know that there was an entry and an exit on the left hand, and we know that there was an entry and an exit on the right hand," Urbaez told NJ.com. "We also know that there was another bullet hole on the right thigh, and two holes in the back. Now, whether they were entry or exit wounds, we are waiting on the final outcome of that. But for Molinelli to say that there was only one bullet hole in the back — whether exit or entry — is certainly far-fetched."
Anibaba was issued a red card in the seventh minute of second-half stoppage time for challenging officials, according to the referee's standard game report compiled after the game. Last Saturday's original game summary on Saturday did not include a red card on Anibaba.

Congressional Democrats are plotting a tax trap for Republicans.
"A mighty empire arises," observes -- almost offhandedly -- the narrator of "Fort Ballads." The line haunts Cathy Park Hong's third book, as she explores the cost of empire, of progress. "Engine Empire" imagines boomtowns -- and their human losses -- in the American Old West, a modernizing China and in a dystopian, virtual future. Reading this book feels like listening to a symphony: Themes develop, vanish and recur amid Hong's abundant verbal music. The intellectual pleasure of such formal intricacy does compromise the emotional resonance, but Hong's triumph is to alienate us from ourselves in order to reaffirm what makes us human. Grade: B+
Cinco de Mayo is often mislabeled as Mexico's Independence Day (mostly by U.S. distributors of Tequila and margarita mix). The date instead marks the May 5, 1862, defeat of the French army at Puebla.

The box-off took place Thursday at the St. Louis County Police and Fire Academy in Wellston where a ring was set up in one corner of the gymnasium. The gym echoed with shouts of encouragement to the boxers, the whirl of jump ropes and the heavy thuds of punches on body bags. Family members carried cameras to photograph their loved ones in action.
Hamilton continues to spout the company line about not playing in the fourth quarter. But it's clear Thibodeau isn't trusting the veteran shooting guard down the stretch. Thibodeau basically admitted between Games 3 and 4 that he wasn't pleased with the starters' transition defense in the third quarter of Game 3, so perhaps Hamilton is the scapegoat for that.

But some low-income patients cut corners by skipping medication and doctor visits until they land in the emergency room. State health officials are seeking waivers from federal rules so coordinated care teams can spend money in new ways. In exchange for that freedom, the teams will be held to state standards for results. They might pay for a patient's bus ride to a doctor or hire a health coach to help manage chronic illnesses.

It must be said that no chef in the world divides people quite the way Andoni Luis Aduriz does at Mugaritz, whose presentations range from the awkward to the aggressive. His side projects include a film musical about food in Ethiopia and Peru, handsome editions of Michael Pollan books translated into Spanish and a multimedia banquet attached to a production of "Titus Andronicus," whose most famous culinary moment involves slaughtered princelings baked into a pie. In interviews, he praises the beauty of insipidness, herbs that whisper, quiet flavors. He likes local plants, especially the unglamorous ones, and loathes salt, cheerful splashes of acidity and wisps of crunch. If cooking has a real avant-garde, a style that frightens away the squares, it is to be found not among the splashy gross-out artists but at Mugaritz, amid the herb garden, on this green, rural hillside only 20 minutes outside San Sebastián but seemingly light-years away. Aduriz's is a melancholic cuisine.

* The Rams defense has definitely earned some respect. Considering the futility of the team's offense, it's no surprise to see the Rams' D wilt later in games. The only area where I think they've done a poor overall job is run defense. The Rams are giving up more rushing yards per game (153) than any NFL team. And they are getting plowed for 4.8 yards per rushing attempt, which ranks 28th among the 32 teams.
After days of closed-door talks, Christie, Assembly Speaker Shelia Oliver (D-Essex) and Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester) reached a deal on one of the biggest pieces of the "tool kit" intended to help municipalities handle the 2 percent property tax limit that goes into effect Jan. 1.
In the summer after Brady’s senior year of high school, Hughes kept an ongoing dialogue with Brady and his parents. “Where we took him in the draft was not indicative of his talent,” recalls Hughes. “Everyone knew, with the commitment to Michigan to play football, he’d be tough to sign. We were certainly willing to pay him a lot more than a typical 18th-round pick, but we still knew it would be tough. With that said, the summer I spent with Tom and his family was the most enjoyable time I’ve ever had not signing a guy. His dad, Tom Sr., was great to deal with. They are just wonderful people.”
Her intense critique of contemporary society combined with her political activism set her apart from other leading women poets of her generation, including Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton.

Who is the audience for this aggressively unsexy movie about a man who engages in empty sex and feels numb? About a woman so hungry for love that a look can bruise her? Pretty much anyone who has unresolved family issues, which includes a significant part of the population old enough to see it. McQueen finds the exquisite tension between the brother wanting to disconnect and the sister longing for connection. To paraphrase a line of Sissy's, it's a good movie that comes from a bad place.
The drive home understandably was much better than the drive to the gym. By the time I arrived, my wife and daughter were asleep.

I ordered a medium buttered popcorn and medium root beer.

Manager Mike Scioscia speaks often about the need for offensive "continuity" but has used 17 lineups in 19 games, and many of his moves involving the bullpen and offense have backfired.
"Now he's like a seven," said Anders, "but he started off at a one. He had never sung in his life. He was like, 'I need to know that I can do this before I sign on.' So I went to his house to hear him sing and even though he was completely green as a singer, his vocal cords were amazing. He had this voice that blew me away. It was the most powerful voice I had ever heard. So loud. He could do anything and go as high as we wanted. It was like a kid discovering he had a new toy. I left there super-pumped knowing that not only could we make him pass as a singer in the movie, but we would blow people away with what he could do."

We found the turnoff from Big Pine that took us literally off the beaten path to No Name Key, noted for a roadside pub by the same name.

You'll be wondering what the plot is. Teenage Wednesday (the sassy Cortney Wolfson) is in love with Lucas (Brian Justin Crum, putting in his time). Wednesday even sings about wanting to break out of her dour self and become more like a normal person -- and she is, horrors, sincere! So, there will be a dinner at the Addams shack with Lucas's parents. Add contrivances, a couple sight gags, stir, and, in the end, love conquers all. Wha? Sentimentality in the Addams Family? Where's my nerve medicine?

Work on perfecting your bedtime routine. Prepare your child with a half-hour warning, and if possible devote that half-hour to an activity the child particularly enjoys – a quiet and calming one, of course -- giving him your full attention. Then make actual bedtime a pleasurable time of conversation, cuddles, songs and stories. Assure him that you will keep him safe through the night, and express confidence that soon, possibly tonight, he will be able to fall asleep right away, and sleep until morning.

I wish that someone would know how we can go about getting an Aldi's and also a Wendy's restaurant here in Affton. There's no Aldi's close by and I'd like to see us have one on Gravois across the street from St. George Church. How great that would be for all of us shoppers. And how about a Wendy's on Watson? There's a vacant restaurant there. If you know about how to get in touch with these companies, tell them about those places that are vacant and how much we'd like to have a Wendy's and an Aldi's in this area.

I’m told you can’t go without trying the Lola fries with fresh rosemary, and they are fabulous. Another time we tried the “porky fries” ($7). A huge plate of shoestring fries is topped with good pulled pork, then drizzled with Cheeze Whiz and pickled chilies — one of our favorite choices. It’s a terrific bar snack with one of the zillion beers available.

But there are aspects of Pollock's work from the years preceding the famous "drip" paintings that remain underexplored. Dartmouth College's Hood Museum of Art, under its new director, Michael Taylor (former curator of modern art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art), has seized the moment by hastily assembling an absorbing dossier exhibition focusing on a crucial period in Pollock's trajectory from representational landscapes, heavily influenced by his teacher Thomas Hart Benton, to his signature abstract masterpieces that, according to popular and Hollywood legend, seemed to spring out of nowhere.

Two other coalition service members also died Saturday in Afghanistan, one in an insurgent attack and another of non-battle related injuries.
Cutler's past of wanting out from the Broncos when things didn't go his way appears to have haunted him. When the Broncos decided to replace fired head coach Mike Shana-han with Josh McDaniels two years ago, which in turn led to the team getting rid of quarterbacks coach Jeremy Bates, Cutler demanded a trade before he even met McDaniels, according to three NFL sources. When Cutler got his way and was traded to the Bears, the perception was that he bailed out of Denver.
"To go out and spend a bunch of money on a high-paying GM job doesn't make sense right now," the source said. "With what has happened the last week or so, it made a lot of sense to put the search on pause."

Diners can choose either the menu gastronomique for $85 (four courses with choices) or the chef's tasting menu for $120 (12 courses). We went for the menu with choices, so our meal started with the pea soup with little balls of fried frog leg meat in the middle.
Hiring foreign engineers is a sensitive topic in South Korea, where the big conglomerates are expected to provide jobs for the country's workers. While unemployment is currently just 3%, the jobless rate for recent college graduates is about 8%.
The problem is not Grenell’s views on international affairs, which are pure Republican; it is his outspoken support of gay marriage. Bryan Fischer, the American Family Assn.’s tweeting Savonarola, told his Twitter followers that, by hiring Grenell, Romney was telling pro-family conservatives to “drop dead.” A National Review columnist predicted that Grenell would quickly switch sides and support President Obama if the incumbent came out in favor of same-sex marriage. The Family Research Council’s Tony Perkins raised the fear that Grenell would use his position to establish “sexual orientation” as a basic human right. (As opposed to what, a capital crime?)

That may not be much when the state is facing a $9.2 billion deficit in its $92.5 billion general fund budget. But downtown San Diego resident Patti Martin agrees with Anderson's idea. She once wrote a Letter to the Editor of the U-T suggesting it.
In practice, of course, it has done nothing of the sort. And while a good deal of the blame lies with sanctimonious politicians who were determined from the get-go to undermine the medical marijuana law, those of us who supported this sloppily drafted public initiative also bear a share of the responsibility.
On issues beyond those disclosure matters, the lawyer said there was no evidence of misuse of funds, no evidence UCAN failed to conduct a required audit, and no proof Shames practiced law with an inactive license. Also, Dostart found the bonuses were legal.

“These guys (the Flyers) are improving. They've got some great players on the power play. They're dangerous. Sometimes Marty (Brodeur) makes the big save. Sometimes we block a shot and we get bounces our way, too. But we can't give them too many opportunities. We have to stay out of the box.”
Besides all of that, airlines have to worry about what their competition does. If one carrier cuts fares, everybody else usually matches -- even if it cuts into profits -- because they know fliers will go for the airline that's $10 cheaper.

Last month, HarperCollins' U.K. division announced the launch of Mischief, its new erotic/romance e-book imprint that has been in the works for about a year with upcoming titles such as "Red Grow the Roses" (vampire erotica) and "Sisters in Sin" (an "arousing" tale of a woman's travels in Italy). Here in the U.S., Avon Red has been putting out racy novels for more than six years but is happy to ride the wave of the "Fifty Shades" success, Avon publisher Liate Stehlik said.

Buy local. Start your search online, but buy in person. Like any building material, a photo of a salvaged item might differ slightly from the physical piece in quality, texture or color. So unless you find a one-of-a-kind heirloom piece you can't get anywhere else, avoid buying from out-of-town vendors. There's no sense paying to have a secondhand toilet shipped to you when you can pick one up from a salvage yard a few miles from home.
The Bruins tied it with 5:33 left in the second when Holtby kicked Andrew Ference's shot wide to his left to Johnny Boychuk, whose shot trickled through the goalie's pads and into the crease. Seguin dove for it, with two defenders crashing on top of him, and swiped it into the net to make it 1-1.

They usually can't pull plays on him because he's stronger and often faster. Now there's even more. Like his teammates, he feels more instinctive in the 3-3-5 defense, a complex system now in its third year at SDSU.

Then, in this past week's Tribune, Bill Alverson debunked Mr. Blanchard's thinking by mentioning Bristol Palin. While not personally in the public forum, she is Sarah Palin's daughter. Apparently he did not know that Sarah Palin herself praised her daughter for speaking out publicly which, to my way of thinking, put her in the same category as her mother. Any child of a public figure is, by default, "free game" for the media. She is definitely NOT a private citizen as in the case of Sandra Fluke.
The building pace is far below the 1.2 million units a year that economists consider healthy.
Soden instructed four players that they were NOT to dress in uniform or sit on the bench with the team for that game because they hadn't been behaving as 'team' members needed to behave. So we went to Half Moon Bay and had only six other players to play that night — Jocelyn had been absent from the last practice due to the flu so, by rule, was not allowed to play, although she did dress down and sit on the bench with the team. By halftime, we were down by 22 points, and the girls came back to the locker room in tears. They wailed about needing their team, to which Soden replied, "THIS is your team! You can win this game or lose it with THIS team — it's up to you."
Colorado's Tad Boyle is quickly becoming a household name, having guided the Buffs to a school-record 24 victories in each of his two seasons in Boulder.

ø•Odds are you didn't draft Miami Marlins veteran Omar Infante for his power, but you're probably thrilled with his five home runs. Enjoy it while it lasts. Infante is putting the ball in the air far more than he usually does. And while 3%-5% of his fly balls have typically left the park over the course of his career, he's over 15% in 2012. In this day and age, 30-year-olds don't magically find a new source of power, so don't expect this barrage to continue. Worse, if he keeps lofting those fly balls, they are going to start landing in gloves and his trademark average might take a hit. A cold front approaching.
