Boorstin wasn't oblivious to the lure of the pseudo. He understood that the entire society seemed in thrall to its own illusions and to its ability to entertain itself with distractions instead of having to engage in the actual mess of life. He knew that the pseudo could be more exciting, more dramatic, more accessible, more fun and less taxing than the real.

That's not to deny the narrative's value as an introduction to the life of this remarkable woman, who is called Suu by her husband, Michael, a writer played by David Thewlis, and by her supporters in Myanmar. (How nice to see a reversal of roles where the husband, for once, stands admiringly at the wife's side.) And it's not to ignore the film's virtues: a chilling account of tyranny enforced by teenage soldiers with dead eyes, red kerchiefs around their necks and automatic weapons in their hands; a sense of a thriving nation with heavenly landscapes—the exteriors were shot in Thailand—turned into an impoverished hell by a superstitious general and his imbecile flunkies; a stirring portrait of the woman who faces them down as she gains confidence, and the eloquence that won her world-wide acclaim.

The first hurdle was to pass the House Education Committee, which spiked the issue last year. On Monday, Rep. Tom Massey, R-Poncha Springs, switched his vote from 2011 and supported the bill. It then went to the House Finance Committee this evening, where it died on a 6-7 party-line vote.
A Jane day out: Like most sights in England, it is possible to visit Bath, Winchester – even Chawton – on a day trip by train from London. But I would suggest making it at least an overnight destination, preferably on a weekday (though check to make sure museums are open). Chawton Cottage is more enjoyable on an uncrowded Thursday than on a jam-packed Saturday.

DJ Kishka, who is often joined by beard-wearing female sidekick Babcia Flo (Polish for Grandma Flo), has become a local attraction. "It's all in good fun," Gorski said.

A short menu and a long ride are great for bringing out people's stories. Jessica and Amy, friends separated by Hurricane Katrina, were trading visits between Houston and New Orleans. John and son Jacob were on the last leg of a train adventure that had taken them all over the Northwest, down the California coast, and now to New Orleans, from where they'd head home to Chicago.

The city's population has increased fivefold (and its area by about 50 square miles) since 1925. Its City Council should be at least twice as large as it was then. The people of Watts, Boyle Heights, Koreatown and other communities should be able to elect their own representatives. How many? There is little point in fixating on a particular number at this point, although it's worth noting that Los Angeles has 35 planning areas. Those divisions seem to be a good place to start.

Part of the Girl Scout Promise is to serve the country, and giving a special treat to the people who serve in uniform seemed a good way to do that.

Nevertheless, this week found him bickering with Jerusalem, in leaks and counterleaks, over responsibility for canceling a joint military exercise. Top administration officials also vehemently deny involvement in the recent assassination of Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, a key figure in Iran’s illegal uranium-enrichment activity.

As for Kate, the rich girl responsible for the waste of words — and in whose sprawling apartment the meetings take place — she’s lucky enough to be in the hands of the incomparable Lily Rabe. A Tony nominee for “The Merchant of Venice,” Rabe modulates her raspy pipes to fantastic effect, whether Kate attacks Kerouac’s machismo or tries hiding her attraction to her old friend and fellow workshopper Martin (the excellent, deceivingly affable Hamish Linklater).

Sabre and some consumer activists disagree.
In context: Mangini's first season, with a 1-11 start, was a disaster. But the Browns won their last four, probably saving his job under new team President Mike Holmgren, who was hired after the season. The 2009 season was also marked by the hiring, then odd mid-season firing, of General Manager George Kokinis, formerly Mangini's friend and hand-picked choice for the job. It appeared the player personnel department was unsettled. The Derek Anderson/Brady Quinn experiment resulted in an offense that scored just over 14 points per game, good for 29th of the 32 teams.

And yet, trying to capture the disparate nature of Los Angeles on the page has often proved difficult because writers get lost trying to define things, to add specific borders — emotional and physical — to something that is inherently diffuse. Because Los Angeles exists outside of Los Angeles County. Los Angeles is also the manufactured country club world of Palm Springs, the false hope of the rotting yacht club at the Salton Sea, the Matterhorn looming over Disneyland. Not even Hollywood is in Hollywood anymore, our actual landscape now more likely to be CGI.
A boost in drawing conventions to St. Louis is the presence of a "hotel cluster" near America's Center and the spiffed up appearance of the big downtown meeting hall, he said.

"You worked with the best experts in every aspect of film-making. If you were doing a Western, you were taught to ride, to fast-draw, anything. But at the same time, I became an anachronism in the age of Brando and method actors. Studios looked on contract players as chattel, you were taken for granted. It got harder to convince my agent and studio that I could do anything out of the range they'd set for me. They'd never let me do a comedy. The only way I was finally able to do something like "Love at First Bite" was if I'd produce it or raise money myself, then everyone's surprised it's this unexpected success."
That is where the silver lining is found, if you look closely enough.
Athol Fugard's talky play probably didn't win a New York Drama Critics' Circle award for its ability to cram more prosaic dialogue into its first 50 minutes than a women's Bunko night. You will hear many chairs creaking in the audience as folks shift their weight trying to find a comfortable position so as to absorb these long stretches of exposition.

Allison Blake, commissioner of the Department of Children and Families, said DYFS could do a better job of involving kids in the planning and decision-making process.

How Do We Go?: Really embarrassingly. Apart from the president (played with all the dignity Danny Glover can muster, which is considerable), people riot and act like cowards. Only author-turned-chauffeur John Cusack manages to sort of keep a handle on things.
The Omidis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
One thing that I was surprised by was the number of sports represented throughout the bar, from the Olympic barbell being deadlifted by a pair of prop arms hanging from the ceiling to an article about curling accompanied by a curling broom. To say that Champions covers all the bases is to resort to a pun that is simply unavoidable.
"Some guys over there, we were in the foxhole for a while," he said. "You're always keeping up on box scores. I'm not a big guy that's gonna watch a lot of baseball games. I'll watch enough video that way. In my free time I like to watch a lot of hockey, especially this time of the year."

After more than 15 years in Arizona, Luis Sanchez, an illegal immigrant, is moving across the country with his wife, Marlen Ramirez, their three children, and two other families.

But Bartók, to create his effects, divides the orchestra into two camps, facing one another like mirror images. Thursday, one wondered if the string players on one side could hear their counterparts on the other. There was persistent out-of-tuneness and rhythmic imprecision. Even so, Outwater battled on, stirring a mood toward the end, just not enough of it. It was time for "Holy Sisters."
Conceivably, Olson said, concerns of local regulators' in Oregon could hold up the entire $8.6 billion sale that touches 14 states-- or force Verizon and Frontier to take Oregon's fiber lines out of the deal.

"Dark Shadows" opens promisingly, downshifts after 30 minutes, and sputters into a meandering, momentum-free mess. Depp plays Barnabas Collins, the brooding bloodsucker who debuted in Dan Curtis' horror-tinged TV soap opera in 1966. An atmospheric prologue sets up his tragic dilemma. The heir of an 18th-century Maine fishing fortune, he rejects the advances of serving girl Angelique (Eva Green). The beauty reveals herself as a witch, kills Barnabas' true love, Josette (Bella Heathcote), transforms him into a vampire and buries him in a padlocked casket.

Under the open enrollment bill, students could go to a school in a different district if officials there say there is room.

Eventually, that's just what Palos and the Oilers did.
Denver traded out of the first round in exchange for moving up 25 spots in the fourth round. The Broncos took defensive tackle Derek Wolfe in the second and cornerback Omar Bolden in the fourth. Wolfe would have been a nice pick in the fourth, but he was a gamble in the second. Bolden, if he's completely healthy after an injury-plague collegiate career, could be a decent sleeper.

Maybe there are just far too many prospects from which to choose? I'm not buying that. Lazy scouting? I could believe that. Arrogant scouting? Indeed. Just plain old scouting mistakes, when players are incorrectly analyzed? Definitely.
To make the loft space feel more intimate and divided, Slein added raised bookshelf "bridges" between rooms, complete with sliding wooden library ladders, as well as an entry wall to create a true foyer. He uses a small den off the foyer as his bedroom (roped off with a red velvet theater rope) and turned the original master bedroom into his full-scale art studio.

Likewise has the orchestra itself become expert. In a moment's notice Thursday, the strings were able to taper off a soaring, lyrical arch and morph into a lilting waltz band, only to shift gears moments later and rattle the heavens with a throbbing, thunderous climax. What's more, their energy continued flowing at full strength well into the work's remotest stretches.
Prices are rebounding from 10-year lows as supplies fall closer in line with average levels for this time of year. The government's latest supply report says U.S. natural gas supplies rose by 28 billion cubic feet last week, below the 30-34 billion cubic feet that analysts had expected.

Blagojevich has kept a low profile since his conviction last summer, declining interview requests. That's in stark contast to his behavior prior to being convicted.

In 2003, a Japanese researcher had better luck connecting dog-related complaints (for excessive barking, biting, etc.) with the magnitude-7.2 Kobe earthquake in 1995. He found from public records that complaints in parts of Japan affected by the quake rose by about 18% during the two months before and after the quake. On the island right above the epicenter, complaints were up 60% in the month before the quake compared with the same month a year before.
Football is the only sport in which every team does not make the playoffs. This format will help some borderline successful programs experience a playoff weekend. Consider Eastlake North, which was 7-3 last year, but has yet to play in the postseason. One playoff game can spark development from the youth level on up, and it gives a shot in the arm to school pride. That might seem clich , but anything that helps morale inside an Ohio school building these days is a blessing.

To my mind, nothing celebrates summer quite like fresh fruit pie. It's as if we're taking the best the season has to offer - beautiful, vibrantly colored fruit nurtured to ripeness under a hot sun - and packaging that bounty in a tender, flaky crust. Like a gift.

If you didn't think that after Sacramento officials dealt with illegal camping downtown and violence broke out in Oakland, you most surely did after the videos of UC Davis police pepper-spraying campus protesters were posted online and went viral. The video made the university and its chancellor the subject of widespread scorn and became a national symbol of the tension between protesters intent on provoking action and authorities grappling with how to respond.
"But I don't think Laura was looking for world recognition. She wasn't that type of person. She had been offered things that would've catapulted her into the public eye, but she turned them down, for whatever reason.

The right-hander allowed six hits and two runs over six innings, walking five. He twice got out of jams by getting the White Sox to bounce into double plays, both started by third baseman Hannahan.
Many municipalities are courting developers to spur transit-oriented growth, but the projects require the ability to satisfy a number of parties with different agendas. Some involve public-private partnerships, with governments paying to build or refurbish a rail line and private developers filling in the rest. That requires coordination between multiple layers of local, state and federal governments, community representatives and residents. Some complain the projects raise prices and force people out of low-income areas.

An alarm system installed at St. Andrew's a few months ago seems to be doing the trick in preventing more thefts. Attacks on St. Mary's in Hatfield Broad Oak have also tailed off since the church added its security system. But a third of its lead roof is already gone and will cost tens of thousands of dollars to replace.
Dave Feldman, the lead singer of Wyldfire and a DJ at local clubs, lives a few blocks from Iris and spends an inordinate amount of his discretionary income shopping for vinyl. “Every day should be Record Store Day!” he enthuses. “One of my happiest vinyl moments was when I got a promo copy of Adam and The Ants Kings of The Wild Frontier, which had this sick Ants catalog with interviews and junk. You never know what kinda treasure you're gonna get with vinyl.”

Self defense is a responsibility that should not be limited. Especially not by geography.
DALLAS — The light from a rising sun pierced through the glass of a hotel suite this morning, a sign to its bleary-eyed inhabitants that their time had come. The newly assembled front office of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim had just worked another 21-hour day, but as baseball's winter meetings came to a close, they hoped their efforts had pushed them to the brink of a coup.
Topol and his colleagues say that a heart attack takes shape days and weeks before it actually happens. The chain reaction can begin with CEC's flaking off the interior wall of one of the three main arteries on the surface of the heart. That causes the artery to crack and results in a blood clot.
"The reason why we got it back so quickly is all of the above," Wright said. "It's Kevin's break-out year, and his play this season. It's signing Rubio and that Rubio played beautifully in this marketplace. It is because of Rick Adelman and Derrick Williams. But it is also because of the way we built our infrastructure around our consumer base."
The city also has a fine artists' bazaar, modern art museum, colonial architecture and scenic churches (many tilting due to the alarmingly soft ground).

Johnson didn't play in 2011, so his hitless streak actually goes back to 2010, when he was hitless in the final two at-bats. Johnson's last hit came May 5, 2010, in Yankee Stadium as a New York Yankee. He had three hits that day against the Orioles.
Toyota maintains its backup systems are sufficient -- and all performed as expected in testing.
Nate, 16, doesn't know whether he'll follow his sister's lead. Only people 18 or older can be tested, unless they're exhibiting symptoms, because a positive result can be shattering news. There's also no cure. Huntington's is devastating on so many levels: People lose coordination, developing wild jerky movements; they suffer behavioral changes, often becoming depressed and psychotic; and in the end, they develop dementia and require total care. One of their last images of their mother was in a wheelchair in a nursing home.
"People are going to see what they want to see — they make their own images and perceptions," Tyson said during a break from filming last fall. "I can't make anybody have an opinion about me. Only thing I can do is treat them the way they'd want to treat me."

The death of music legend Whitney Houston has cast a dark shadow over Sunday's Grammy Awards.
In his pro debut Monday night for Low-A Quad Cities, Wong went 2-for-2 with two RBIs, a walk and a hit batter. He started at second base and hit third for Johnny Rodriguez's River Bandits, two spots Wong will be familiar with as this season speeds ahead. Wong was a part of a double play and got caught trying to steal second. He had two singles but neither of his RBIs came on those hits. In his first pro at-bat he lofted a sacrifice fly to score Ronny Gil for QC's first run. Later he was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded to force in a run.

Siciliano said it came down to the type of device and the operating system.
Indeed, much of the DePersio family is involved in the restaurant: Brother Anthony DePersio is a partner; and grandfather Paul Martino is behind the homemade orecchiette and cavatelli. The food at Fascino is both elemental and transcendent. It’s food that you know, but made with such a light hand it seems almost an ethereal version of the original. It’s all intentional; DePersio is healthy, a guy who works out five times a week and bested every trainer at his gym in a recent mini-triathalon.
Dylan led the way down the narrow steps into the cellar. Margie held back. Recent renovations had overlooked this dark little room. Loose boards covered a dirt floor; a mouse ran for cover. There were alcoves along one wall, perhaps places to sleep. The bricks were dirty and marred.

Board games, our old standby, got old quick. Even Candyland, 4-year-old Little Bits' favorite, could only hold their attention for so long. We colored, we drew, we made innumerable castles of wooden blocks and knocked them down again. And that got us till noon on Tuesday.

If spotted owls eventually are classified as endangered, the company will be insulated from cranked-up restrictions.
Ohio law must reflect both the government's obligation to public safety and the public's right to know how its money is spent and how its institutions are run. Confidentiality about security makes sense. Secrecy when it comes to accidents and safety improvements does not.
