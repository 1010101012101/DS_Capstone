At the same time, Florida's domestic-migration numbers were sagging. For years, Florida had led the nation in that department: from 2001 to 2006, 140,000 more people moved to Florida than departed for other states. But by 2007, annual domestic migration to Florida had dropped to 17,000. In 2008, Florida lost a net 19,000 residents to other states; in 2009, it lost 31,000. This huge reversal of Florida's fortunes became the subject of much analysis. Could Florida's demographic struggles portend the decline of the Sunbelt, which had accounted for more than 80 percent of U.S. population growth since 1980?

With Matthews, Rudy and our two new point guards, PLUS Mills, we have a packed backcourt.

From citizens' point of view, though, the report makes little sense. Why auction off leases on all the state's acreage at once, which would seem to guarantee rock bottom bids for most of it? The price of natural gas already has sunk to multi-decade lows as new supplies flooded the market. And even at today's low prices for natural gas, efficiency programs that protect against future price swings should continue.

Gingrich’s point on religious liberty is simple: “The government should not force its values on any religious institution.” But he probably doesn’t intend it to be as grand an idea as it sounds. The government’s values include not discriminating against people on the basis of their race, and there’s no carve-out for church-affiliated hospitals to deny care to blacks or Asians. It’s doubtful that Gingrich would want to give religious institutions carte blanche to ignore U.S. law. Instead, he seems focused on the requirement that employers affiliated with religious institutions include contraceptive coverage in their employee health insurance policies, although the cost would have to be covered by the insurer.

Some choose to live here and do get national work, but the opportunities are limited. The Second City veteran and respected improviser David Pasquesi chose to stay, but even he was in LA this spring for TV pilot season.

So there was absolutely no reason to go out there."

The hard part is recommending "The Devil's Double" for any reason beyond Cooper's impressive turn. Much of the film is a tiresome "Scarface"-retread (the Al Pacino version, not the Paul Muni original).

Two other factors strongly support the need for Mr. Teare to answer questions sooner rather than later. First, in responding to the public information requests, he redacted portions of the documents because they contained information from a state criminal records database that would be illegal to release to the public — or, for that matter, to Mr. Leopold.

In fact, federal constraints resulted in a perverse incentive: a homeowner who begins using less electricity -- as kids move out, for example -- would do well financially by turning on every appliance in the house to keep checks coming at gross rates as high as 65 cents per kilowatt hour.

Salsify shows up, the root vegetable pared thin as noodles, in several different guises. Some are plain. Some have an edge dipped into charred leek ashes, as if to mimic a model's smoky eye.

The answer: It is the CEO that provides leadership and sets the tone and direction for a particular company. In my current position, it's about making a difference in the lives of others. In most of my previous positions, much of my work was reactive, like setting policies for health and human service issues or determining how individuals would transition from welfare to work. This is the first time that I have an opportunity to really provide direction in the creation and implementation of leadership development programs that can shape the lives of girls and prepare youth to become our leaders of tomorrow.

Canon G1 X -- The Japanese camera maker revealed a compact camera that pushes into professional camera territory. Its G line of relatively large compact cameras has been popular among enthusiasts, and the G1 X extends the range by including an image sensor that's more than six times larger than other models in the range. Sensor size is the most important factor for a camera's image quality, far more than the number of megapixels -- 14, for the G1 X. It's the first camera to use a sensor of this type, which is only 20 percent smaller than the "APS-C" sensors used in single-lens reflex cameras, or SLRs (though some luxury compacts from other manufacturers use APS-C sensors).

To the side of that scrolling declaration of dominance is a quote from a '97 Nike spot that depicts MJ in a less-glamorous, more vulnerable light: "I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed." Such steely focus on the process of overcoming failure and coping with self-doubt suggests an incredible self-awareness and mental toughness.

The action in GCO’s production took place in Scipio’s shag-carpeted bedroom, with a fair amount of dressing and undressing. Fortuna expressed her changeability with a series of makeovers--cowgirl, dominatrix, fashion plate--and shifted from a flight attendant smile to a terrifying scowl.

1. Lone Star (1996) Sam Deeds: One of the biggest Oscar snubs in history is how little respect this John Sayles film received. Cooper plays a man whose father once was a Mexican border town's legendary sheriff. Once Cooper gets the same post, he sets out to destroy that legend. Cooper and Elizabeth Pena deserved acting nominations, and it should have also received best picture and best director nods. All it received was a script nomination for Sayles.

Frank: If we essentially receive money from two places to educate a student, tuition that they and their family pay and per student funding that all of us as taxpayers chip in to provide what we have historically seen as a public good. When you combine those two sources and adjust them for inflation, we educate a student for the exact same amount today that we did 20 years ago. That's a pretty impressive record of maintaining the cost of education. We've had to focus much more on financial aid models, to buy down that affordability cost of access for low-income and middle-income families.

High-quality leather and soft-touch plastics give the Q5's cabin an expensive look and feel, but - and this is a big but - Audi's interior designers should go back to color class. Jet black and cinnamon brown simply do not get along, and confined spaces only amplify garish color combinations.

"We worked so hard, and we had so many chances,'' captain Jonathan Toews said. "And every time we had a chance and it didn't go in, you kept saying, ‘Keep working; we'll get another one; it'll go in eventually.' We just didn't get the bounce.''

It sure knows how to count the money, though. “Recovery” was one of the two biggest-selling albums of the year; other high-profile rap releases by West, Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, B.o.B, Lil Wayne, Drake and T.I. were all chart-toppers. Many of these albums were superior to Slim Shady’s comeback effort. The Grammy voters, however, stubbornly refused to demonstrate any imagination or perspective in the Best Rap Album category.

My initial response was to say "Stay clear, and head to the library."

Creating new lab schools around the country and training more teachers to innovate will take time. Meanwhile, what the parents of future innovators do matters enormously. My interviews with parents of today's innovators revealed some fascinating patterns.

As their children matured, they also encouraged them to take risks and learn from mistakes. There is much that all of us stand to learn from them.

Thursday, students browsed at Portland State's first open-to-all-majors spring job fair. The timing was a nod to how the recession has changed job shopping. PSU used to have one all-majors job fair in the winter, but it now has three -- fall, winter and spring.

Leshoure has a tough road back, especially if he is the one driving on it. In February, Leshoure was cited for driving his BMW 92 m.p.h. in a 70-m.p.h. zone on I-94 around 6 a.m. with a gram of marijuana in a backpack in his backseat. If you believe police reports, he decided the problem was the BMW. A few weeks later, also on I-94, he was pulled over in a rental SUV. Leshoure was cited for marijuana possession; police say he tried to eat it, to conceal it, when an officer approached. I don't know what he was using to wash it down. Probably a milkshake.

Hitchcock said Backes was fine after the game.

"Not many people know that there was once a marshy lake the size of three city blocks in the middle of the Mission District," Buscovich says. "You could reach it by boat from the bay, via Mission Creek. If you overlay maps of the '06 and Loma Prieta quake damage, you'll find they're remarkably similar. The filled-in marshes, creeks and bayshore areas remain inherently riskier than other parts of the city."

ø Under a promotion that goes through Father's Day, GM drops the cost of OnStar from $299 (plus an extra $50 to $100 for installation) to just $99 for everything. You still must subscribe to an OnStar service plan, starting at $18.95 a month or $199 a year.

Turn-by-turn navigation brings the monthly cost to $28.95 or $299 a year - a lot, given cheaper alternatives on smartphones and other devices.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Tuesday that crop insurance will cover the farmers, despite the fact that the flooding was, in effect, "man-made."

MS is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks the myelin that surrounds and insulate nerves, effectively short-circuiting them and making movements difficult. An estimated 400,000 Americans now have MS -- 2.1 million worldwide -- and another 200 patients are newly diagnosed each week. For reasons that are unclear, the disease affects two to three times as many women as men, and people with a close relative who has the disease are about 20 times more likely than normal to develop it themselves. Relapsing-remitting MS is marked by periods of flareups or exacerbations in which the disease progresses, interspersed with periods of remission. About 85% of MS patients suffer relapsing-remitting MS as the first stage of their disease.

Even recently, before our marriage was blessed in the Catholic Church, my husband and I took a course about building good marriages. It was a video series by a nondenominational Christian group, and the segment called "Good Sex" did not mention children once. In all the talk about bonding and back rubs and intimacy and staying in shape, the closest the videos came to connecting sex to the creation of life was a brief note that couples should discuss the topic of contraception.
Mary will run again next Saturday in another meet. Might try the 100 meters. Or maybe the 200, again. It's the hardest thing in sports to attempt to duplicate a big moment.

The athletic director and a university vice president were charged with perjury and failure to report a 2002 allegation to police, and Paterno was fired following mounting fury he did not do more about the charge — that Sandusky assaulted a boy in the Penn State football showers — than pass it along to his bosses. President Graham Spanier also was ousted for similar reasons.

Jesse Spector, The Sporting News: "With Ryan Suter looming as an unrestricted free agent and Shea Weber a trade candidate if he cannot come to terms on a long-term deal as a restricted free agent, Nashville general manager David Poile not only had to treat this season as the Predators' best chance at a Stanley Cup, he needed to prove to his two All-Star defensemen that the organization was committed to winning . . .

Comment: His stock is somewhat hard to figure; some NFL teams might see him as an underrated player who was simply overshadowed in college, but others may conclude that he's not quite the elite athlete some others at his position are. It's true that he's not the biggest or the fastest safety, but Taylor - whose brother Curtis was selected out of LSU by San Francisco in the seventh round in 2009 - is a hard-working, smart player who should be able to add depth to a defensive backfield quickly.
