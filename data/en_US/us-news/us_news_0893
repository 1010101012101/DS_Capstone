Simpson joined the morning leaders with a 15-foot birdie putt on the 11th, but no birdie was more unlikely than No. 12. His tee shot went into the right rough, and because of trees blocking the flight of his ball, hit a low bullet that ran up the hill to the back side of the green, leaving him a 60-foot putt that swung sharply to the left and ran quickly away from him.
Moderates are typically less educated than either liberals or conservatives, Gauchat said. "These folks are just generally alienated from science," he said, describing them as the "least engaged and least knowledgeable about basic scientific facts."

DISORDERLY CONDUCT (JUVENILE), AURORA ROAD: When an officer on patrol just after 4:30 p.m. on April 25 noticed an RTA bus stopped near Melbury Road, with the driver outside chasing a juvenile, he pulled over as well and learned that the boy, 15, had been unruly on the bus when asked to turn his music down. After calling the driver names, he allegedly spit on her, before the Garfield Heights woman went after him. The boy admitted to cursing at her, but claimed to have been spitting on the floor, although a witness on the bus backed up the driver’s account. He will be cited into county Juvenile Court.

Tolls on the highway will rise 10 percent for bill- and coin-paying customers as of Jan. 1. There will be no increase for travelers who use E-ZPass. The reason? Pennsylvania, like Ohio, wants to encourage more people to use the system. The state offered a similar enticement last year when it raised rates. With the new increase, cash-paying customers in Pennsylvania will now pay 17 percent more than those with E-ZPass.

"It separates the men from the boys when you build something like that," said Kemp, recalling the mental gymnastics it took to build the house. Every structural roof member, for example, is a different size and had to be cut on the radius to fit flush with the unusual line of the roof. Kemp, who has been building houses for more than 40 years, said that he wasn't intimidated by the project, in large part because of his rapport with Mulfinger.
Another change would have the state retain the naming rights for an outdoor plaza at the stadium, which would be located at the Metrodome site in downtown Minneapolis. “The naming rights are just for the plaza, not for the stadium,” said Rosen, who said the team would retain the stadium's more lucrative naming rights.

GM notched a record $7.6 billion profit last year, nearly three years after a government bailout and trip though bankruptcy court. Sales picked up in much of the world, and its North American unit, long a money loser, surged to profitability. Yet the price of its stock, 27% of which is still held by the U.S. government, continues to languish, in large part because of the problems in Europe, where 18% of GM's revenue came from last year.
"Timeout" for day care: A daycare provider was arrested Wednesday after she left a 15-month-old girl in a "timeout" outside for an hour, the Beaverton Police Department reported.

Which isn't to say the book is an unpleasant experience. Klosterman is terrifically expressive, funny company, and if references to Daniel Johnston and Chevy Chase's "Fletch" inspire knowing nods and descriptions such as, "He looked like someone who might have played in a ska band when he was 16" conjure a mental picture, than you're already one of his people. But even when writing a book dedicated to exploring invisibility, Klosterman's unique voice is never less than right out in the open.

On a positive note, I was able to pass legislation which will create a new farm brew license for Maryland farms to utilize their crops for the creation of craft beer. The bill will provide Maryland farms the ability to use winter barley, wheat crops and Maryland hops to allow farm breweries to mirror our local wineries. The new craft beer market has progressed quickly in the Northeast and this will give our local agriculture marketing program a boost to allow Harford County farmers to add another local product to their menu.

It has been amazing and confounding that for the last several years we have all been hearing and reading about 'robo-signing' of bank foreclosure documents and countless other types of fraudulent mortgages and less-than-honest business practices by lenders. It appears that anyone, including my dog, could apply for a mortgage with little down payment and almost no evidence of ability to repay a loan. I have even read about NINA (no income, no assets) loans. It looks like the brokers who signed off on those loans are the only ones who benefited by lining their wallets with hefty commissions. Now the lenders are the not-so happy-owners of thousands of homes which have been abandoned by their past owners through little fault of their own, and of course we the taxpayers are expected to bail them out.

Debate over how to achieve that took up the day and most of the night Saturday. Some Republicans objected to the expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor. The House bill would extend it to anyone earning up to 150 percent of the federal poverty level, or $33,075 for a family of four. Although the federal government would pay nearly all the new costs, Republicans warned that it would still stress states' budgets and add to federal obligations.

øAuthor and former car salesman Ray Lopez says consumers have more bargaining power if they're considering two items that aren't on sale. Shoppers looking at, say, a $900 TV and a $400 Blu-ray player should target the TV for a discount because there's more markup in the price, he says. He suggests telling the salesman you'll take the Blu-ray player at full price, but you want the TV for $800 - and that you'll buy both or none at all. Then, he says, only let the salesman speak to his manager twice before making a final offer.

Kennedy had picked him in part because Johnson could help ensure support in Texas and other Southern states, but by the fatal visit to Dallas in November 1963, Johnson's influence had fallen enough that Kennedy made some key decisions about the trip in a meeting to which Johnson was not invited. At the same time, an investigation into the finances of Johnson aide Bobby Baker was leading to questions about Johnson himself. Life magazine was planning a long investigation.

Many more underwater California homeowners will get principal reductions when the change takes effect in early June, but there's a catch: The reduction is structured as a forgivable loan. If they sell their house within five years, any profit will go toward repaying the principal reduction. After five years, there is no repayment requirement. Under current rules, the loan is forgiven after three years.
He also revels in a wildly creative group called "The Whack Brothers," which hangs out at the Springsteen homestead in New Jersey. They got their name while recording with Scialfa at the home studio.

Another tip: rent glasses. Cheap plastic cups are for college keggers. Check the Yellow Pages or online for a nearby party rental store.

It appeared to be an all-out attempt to take back the city -- which has a history of dissent -- after residents all but took it over since June, barricading it against the regime. Rights group say at least 100 people have been killed, while some estimates put the number as high as 250.

The Mistake: It's not easy leaving corporate America to become an entrepreneur. I made the mistake of waiting four years after I started a business on the side before I decided to take the leap. My business partner and I had the fundamentals in place, including satisfied clients. But we should have trusted our capabilities sooner. Instead we continued to moonlight. I had a high-level management position, which meant I was working two full-time jobs. Typically, I'd get home at 6 p.m. and head to my basement office an hour later. It would be close to 6 a.m. overseas and we'd go at it until 10 p.m. Depending on what meetings I had at work the next day, I might have to get back up at 4 a.m. Sometimes I'd have to travel to Europe for my corporate job. Meanwhile, my partner in Dallas had a similar schedule while working for corporate America. My company has changed tremendously. But it all started with me helping a company in the U.S. to find a supplier in the Asian market. I brokered a deal for a major global corporation by getting a company in a different field to use its machines and the same process to make much larger parts. The banking environment was much more conducive to giving small business owners loans back then. I should have used that multimillion-dollar deal to secure funding with a loan and a line of credit. Instead, I continued to bootstrap the business.

BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS, COMIC ROLE:
It’s good to see the issue of body image is drawing the attention of a wider range of experts. Computer scientists are people one might presume have little interest in women’s self-help magazines -- and are also far removed from the hallways of American high schools where young girls struggle with anorexia or bulimia. Instead of studying, too many girls are dreaming of liposuction and other plastic surgeries to release them from the bodies they were born with.

While questions have been raised about some of Colao’s patients, many have been recognized for acts of heroism. Some have taken killers, carjackers and armed robbers off the streets.

I want to avoid surgery at all costs if I can," said Scott, who is batting .223 with nine homers and 22 RBIs in 206 at-bats after homering a career-high 27 times last year. "But at the end of the day, if it turns out that surgery is the best option, it's necessary that I have to do it, then of course I have to do it. But I am still on my knees praying and just hoping that I don't have to have surgery."

The big IPO market never really came back after the dot-com bust, except for a couple of quarters. Now it's locked down tight for this year, and maybe beyond. And while there will still be mergers and acquisitions this year, they're going to be happening at bargain basement rates. So returns for the VC industry have not been great for the past few years, and now they're going to get worse.

According to the report, Newark spends almost twice as much per capita than the state average. Much of that goes to a police force that is 86 percent larger than the state average. The city’s tax rate is 10 percent below the state average, despite a tax base that has grown over the last decade. With a 2 percent tax cap on the horizon, the city is running out of time to head off a long-term budget meltdown, according to the task force.

Even in rich countries, there hasn’t been much appetite to make major policy changes to fight chronic diseases. Europe has the world’s highest level of alcohol problems, yet in the wine-producing countries of Italy, Portugal and Spain, there is no tax on wine.

The U.S. spends far more on healthcare — per capita and as a percentage of GDP — than any other nation on Earth, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In 2010, that amounted to approximately $2.6 trillion. Each year, we Americans not only pay more for private health insurance than the citizens of other OECD countries; we also spend more on out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. And on top of that, we devote more tax dollars, per person, to healthcare than the Swedes, the French, the Germans, the Canadians or the British.
Ironically, though, the law that furnishes Weinblatt's next-door neighbors with possible grounds for an invasion of privacy claim against him could provide Weinblatt with the basis for a counterclaim, because he, too, became a target of surveillance -- videotaping, no less -- after arousing his neighbor's maternal suspicions.

Some observers argue these private interest bills do, ultimately, benefit at least a portion of the public. Thad Kousser, associate professor of political science at UC San Diego, said legislators who introduce sponsored bills on behalf of industries are doing exactly what they are sent to Sacramento to do: represent the interests of their district.

I made food runs for kids' slumber parties. I banged pots and pans in the street with the neighbors as the New Year dawned. Our cute white-and-orange Jack Russell-Chihuahua mix dog, who thinks anything below 80 degrees is cold, suddenly became habitually clingy, slipping next to me in the easy chair in the living room every morning as I read the newspaper (yes, I still like the paper and ink version of things).
The villain, Loki, Thor's semi-brother who dreams of murdering billions, is also strong. As played by Tom Hiddleston ("War Horse"), he is suitably menacing without being over the top. Even the lesser-known fighters, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, pull off fully rendered characters. One terrific addition is Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk. Ruffalo portrays a more world-weary Bruce Banner, and the filmmakers smartly save his metamorphosis into the big angry green guy for later in the action, greatly increasing his impact.

To serve the mission and compete with the best, we have to behave like a private hospital.

That means planning for future developments in medical technology, government programs and patient needs.

However, the first $250,000 of capital gain is exempted, since it was the sale of a personal residence.

When you analyze this, you have to look at the numbers when Jeff Garcia has been the Eagles' quarterback. We have celebrated Garcia's work here for good reason, because he brought fire and hope and skill to a season thought to be over when Donovan McNabb tore up a knee against Tennessee in the Eagles' 10th game of the season. He deserves every bit of the praise he has received, and he deserves to be back here next season.

Admitted, I didn’t like the previous film in this series, which tried too hard to turn Holmes into an action hero. And as a director, Guy Ritchie is still far too fond of sequences tracking bullets in slow-motion.

3. Sidestep hormone disturbers. The most famous one, BPA, is linked to a protein found in up to 30 percent of women with breast cancer. Fortunately, BPA has been removed from virtually all hard plastic bottles, glasses and pitchers, but most tinned foods still come in cans lined with BPA-laced material (it excels at blocking spoilage and can contaminates).

Meanwhile, try to buy fresh or frozen foods, look for BPA-free cans -- about 20 percent are (usually from organic lines) -- and don't take thermal receipts you don't need. If you do, stash 'em, and wash your hands before touching food.

Teamsters Local 399 has 130 union members who are animal trainers, handlers and wranglers, down from as many as 500 in the 1970s.

Never heard of gorlami? Me, either. Turns out it's a made-up name, inspired by a line from "Inglourious Basterds," but its fabulous, late-summer flavors were entirely real: a tender, buttery pasta ribbon laid out on a slow-cooked sweet corn pudding and dressed with caramelized bits of zucchini and a tangy goat's milk froth.

assumes that because we have high unemployment they are going to win the election hands down is mistaken. It's true there has been a rule since 1936, no president has been re-elected with unemployment above I think it's 7.8 percent. I don't think that rule applies anymore. We sort of have gotten used to perhaps not nine percent, but it isn't as shocking as it would have been had we been at four

Court records in the criminal case also said Christian’s biological mother hadn’t seen the boy since 2005, when Riley’s father got custody of Christian and his sister. How did he get custody? The biological mother wasn’t talking, and court records were sealed, but at a hearing in the murder case, Riley Choate’s lawyer requested the records and mentioned the name of Choate’s lawyer in the custody case. That lawyer, George Galanos, remembered the case and that a court-appointed guardian ad litem had ruled that it was in the best interests of the children to place them with their father.
For some reason, Oakley also gets on Thunder center Kendrick Perkins for being dunked on (we presume he's referring to the one poster job from the Clippers' Blake Griffin).

But here, Rooney Mara, the heroine, looks more bored than terrified. Classmate Katie Cassidy looks less like a high-schooler than a hardened Hollywood wife. And while Kyle Gallner, our pasty and bushy-browed hero, seems to have been groomed to evoke Robert Pattinson, all he recalls is Kate Winslet in "The Reader," only less butch.

The stuff in bottles labeled Templeton Rye is contracted out to Lawrenceburg Distillers in southeast Indiana, which at 28 million gallons of spirits produced per year is anything but the quaint Iowa image the Templeton brand is meant to evoke. The whiskey is trucked to Templeton, offloaded at the plant and bottled there. A staff of gray-haired locals does the rest: hand writing the labels, affixing them to bottles and sealing the bottles shut. At least in that way the operation is very quaint, very small town and very Iowa.
Police Detective Mark Rodebaugh said he has found allies in dealers like Southern Metal but needs more. Only 10 of 30 dealers invited to a recent theft forum showed up.
•Diagnostic laziness. Increases in studies ordered do not necessarily correspond to any increased complexity of medical diagnosis. Last year, a Johns Hopkins study demonstrated a three-fold increase in emergency room studies ordered nationwide over the past decade without any corresponding increase in diagnosis of life-threatening conditions. As pressures mount on physicians to see ever-increasing numbers of patients, traditional methods of patient assessment have gone by the wayside. Many doctors replace physical exams with diagnostic CT and MRI scans. Instead of laying their hands on the patient, physicians at the bedside have delegated diagnostic duties to other physicians, such as radiologists, who interpret these imaging studies. Worse yet, rising patient rolls from increasing health insurance coverage can only increase such dereliction of duty to the patient.

The fourth work by writer/director Joseph Cedar, Israel's most accomplished filmmaker, Footnote has not lacked for recognition. It took the screenplay award at Cannes, won nine Israeli Oscars (including picture, script and direction for Cedar, plus a pair of acting awards).

By this time, I'd learned that in Argentina and Uruguay, well-done meat, far from being unsophisticated, is traditional. Short ribs are the star player in the characteristic asado, or barbecue, of South America's Southern Cone. At the core of the asado is another way to look at beef. Uruguayans and Argentineans care less about tenderness, and more about flavor, than Americans do.
I teach for all the crazy people who believe this, too.
The process starts on Tuesday and needs to end no later than October in order to get the $50 million on the books by Nov. 18. In that time the plan needs to be finalized by the city council, accepted by the improvement authority, and appraised by the county and the city.

Unfortunately, a short sale is often anything but quick or short. Each lender can take as long as they deem necessary to approve or disapprove a short sale. Also, every lender and short sale request may be on a different schedule. In addition, if you are receiving foreclosure notices or warnings from your lender, do not ignore them even if another department of the same bank is considering your request to approve a short sale. There have been cases in which one department of a financial institution foreclosed on a home while another department of the same lender was in the process of reviewing a short sale request from the homeowner.

What struck me about the Tab 2 was how it's both similar to and different from Apple's iPad.

It's hard to know what would have happened if Apple hadn't re-imagined the smartphone back in 2007 or taken the risk of coming out with a tablet in 2010 despite other company's failed attempts at tablets during the previous decade.

On Friday, Superintendent Clive Coleman outlined initiatives for the 2011-2012 school year, including expanding preschool, reconfiguring middle schools, changing start times at the high school and transforming the district's nine elementary schools. The proposals would allow parents to choose their elementary school.

Giving parents a choice in schools would give them greater sense of ownership in the district, leading to improvement, Coleman said.

That's it. My wife thinks it's funny, but I certainly won't be committed to any state-run institutions over such behavior in the near future. I also am well aware of the fact that the two teams I root for have never won a single meaningful title game between the two of them, so perhaps my silly little rituals don't mean much at all.
