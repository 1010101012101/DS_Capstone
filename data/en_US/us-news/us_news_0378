On the funky side, Marie still had the moves, dancing in step (with no sense of irony) with her three back-up vocalists and seven-piece band, breaking out the rhythm guitar for certain tunes and taking an occasional spin on the congas. A revisiting of classic funk tracks "I Need Your Lovin'," "I'm Just a Sucker for Your Love" and Rick James' "You and I" found them vibrant and relevant.

The Ohio House of Representatives held a hearing on this bill on March 22, and voting-rights officials from Ohio and other states testified in its favor. Not one of these proponents could point to a single instance of voter fraud that had occurred in Ohio (or in their own states) that cannot be prevented by current law but would be prevented by HB 159.

The longtime former home of Coco's at 731 South Lindbergh Boulevard has been transformed into a red and black, vaguely Vegas-esque dining room and bar. Although Sinatra's estate apparently wasn't fond of the use of his nickname, huge pictures of him dominate the room, including some with his Rat Pack pals.

But Baltimore is not Sanford, Fla., and nothing like the level of racial tension evident there has occurred here. In fact, there is no reason to believe that the Trayvon Martin case precludes a fair trial for the Werdesheims. There have been a number of news stories that have noted the similarities between the two cases, but the charges, evidence and applicable laws are entirely different. There may be some jurors in this city — or in any of Maryland's counties — who could not have objectively considered this case because of their opinions about the handling of Trayvon Martin's, but they could have been weeded out in the jury selection process. The brothers' decision to give up their right to a trial before a jury of their peers should eliminate that concern altogether.

If Bud Black were president, I could see him standing there talking to the national media, throwing out some wisecracks, curves and knuckle balls. After finally giving his thanks, he'd walk away, only to stop, do a Columbo, turn and say: "Oh, one other thing. I've decided not to seek re-election."
Busch Stadium was still in frenzy when Freese opened the 11th with a leadoff shot over the center field wall off Mark Lowe. Freese thrust his arm in the air as he rounded first base, and the crowd was delirious.

HOUSTON - The Mets moved the fences in at Citi Field this season to do more damage with home runs. Their opponents are getting the same effect in every ballpark by simply stepping into the batter's box.
"The third floor Andrew Carnegie Meeting Room is particularly interesting because we uncovered a large Cass Gilbert-designed skylight above the room that had been covered for many years with a false ceiling. It needed minor repairs, but otherwise, was completely intact. We also found a beautiful original wooden floor that had been hidden away for decades. These are just two of the many ‘surprises' we've had during the restoration."

For much of the day, the market was down on pessimism about weak economic reports -- a problem that will continue to dog the market. A day after the Federal Reserve issued a slightly more bleak outlook on the economy, two regional reports pointed to a slowing in manufacturing activity in the Northeast. Meanwhile, the Fed reported modest growth in industrial output nationwide. And the Labor Department said that first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, but that was largely due to seasonal factors.

SAN DIEGO CHANGES
To turn the trick this time, the Blues will need to create more scoring opportunities, after scoring just three goals on 58 shots in Games 1-2.

"I grew up in Baltimore and witnessed the Cal Ripken streak (in baseball), but football is a completely different sport," Schwartz said. "At quarterback, you have a target on you.

Yet the stacked stones and eerie timelessness of the mountaintop endure. To see and feel this wonder at its best, all you need to do is take a series of planes, trains and automobiles, bring bug juice and sunblock, accept the thin air and some high prices, and get up early. The ruins open daily at 6 a.m., and that's when you want to be there.

This is further compounded by the proposed reduction in the local government fund.

Full disclosure: My brain is fried from trying to comprehend the events of Monday night. This must be why old-school sportswriters used to sip whiskey in the press box. This is too bizarre to absorb and understand on a tight deadline. Game 5 came down to phone calls? Really? And how do we possibly explain this? What do I look like, a Verizon salesman?

Schlereth repeatedly struggled until the Tigers sent him to Triple-A Toledo two weeks into the season. He allowed eight earned runs in seven innings. He's now on the disabled list at Toledo with shoulder tendinitis.
The divisive nature of our public debate has gone too far. None of us can claim with certainty that we have a corner on the truth. We can only do harm to people when we demonize them, when we see each other as less than human, as less worthy than ourselves. People on all sides of the political and social issues of our time must reject violence. Throwing rocks will never change anyone's heart.
He's right. Send Terry Coleman to Sacramento.
"We were unable to play defense the way we need to play and get stops when we had to. That's what it is. It wasn't a case of being out-matched. We have to do 11-man defense and that's what we're preaching here. We had too many break downs."

"As you are aware the GIT (gross income tax) collections for April were more than $550 million below expectations. Owing to the delayed filing deadline for many residents, we assumed that much of this shortfall would be made up in May. Based on the collection data now available, it seems that this assumption was overly optimistic. There is a high probability that GIT collections for FY10 will fall significantly below the levels assumed in the GBM (governor's budget message) and that projections for FY11 may have to be tempered as well. We will be working between now and Tuesday to quantify the impact in both years, but I thought you ought to be alerted to what we know at this time. "

I instinctively started honking my horn. The celebration - any celebration - was on. This was a stunning victory moment for all of us. At the Massachusetts home of team captain Mike Eruzione (who scored the winning goal), dozens of fans gathered on his lawn and sang the national anthem.

Advocates of the deal say it should pass legal muster because the payments are based on a long-term estimate of what the benefits would be under the standard methodology. The scheduled amounts would have negligible impact on ratepayers in the short run, but do escalate over time, providing a larger offset.

The level of unanimity also raises hope that they can finally put the issue to bed.

At this stage, you're pretty much guaranteed to be running into a hot goalie in the playoffs, and the question is always how long that hot streak lasts. It's a bad matchup to the extent that it will be hard to take the Kings out of their game, because it's not a wide-open style. This might be a lower-scoring series than the one with the Sharks was, and overtimes are inevitable. Neither team has an abundance of playoff vets, and let's face it, the Kings were the No. 8 team in the West. All in all, it won't be easy, but if I were the Blues, I'd rather face them than the Predators at this stage.

In the long term, two other concessions Mr. Kamenetz secured will be even more significant. If fewer than five licenses transfer in any given year, the county will be allowed to create new service bar licenses — that is, for table service of beer and wine in a restaurant — without regard to the population quotes (though, again, not in Towson or Arbutus). And any new licenses created that way or by population growth would not be eligible for sale from one establishment to another. Those two reforms, at least in a small way, begin to transfer control of the system back to the local government, where it belongs.

For a reader, trying to keep track of the various Teddys and Aprils, the Alices and Barrys whose lives criss-cross in a variety of ways in "Palo Alto" this is an insurmountable problem. Franco seems to grasp the literal meaning of "God is in the details"—virtually every character has his or her gene pool racially dissected and locations are rendered with GPS precision—but not the spirit.

Civil disobedience on behalf of causes we believe in is a time-honored American tradition ("Going to jail for the environment," August 22). Another time-honored American tradition is keeping an open mind about the issues, listening to different views and then forming an opinion.

His unconscionable sin: putting men on base and then (you won't believe this, but I swear it happened) actually letting them score.

The kickoff is the only play in football where a player can get a running start before reaching the line of scrimmage at the ideal moment.

Until recently, you would have been hard-pressed to find a pizza, much less a short-rib pot roast with bone-marrow turnover pie and a cutting-edge cocktail made with chai-infused tequila. But that's changing as another generation of restaurants and cafes is sprouting between Olympic and Santa Monica boulevards — amid the new boutiques, salons and food trucks. The neighborhood is a magnet for the hungry and the restless (which also means parking hasn't gotten any easier).

In the U.S., berbere most often is found as a dry powder, though it sometimes is a paste in Ethiopia. The powder can be added directly to just about anything, or heated briefly with oil and minced garlic and onion. The latter makes a great starter for chili or pulled pork.
"That indicates they have evidence (Zimmerman) was chasing Trayvon because he was black," said Florida defense attorney Richard Hornsby.

The friends slipped into a governors' reception and stood three feet from Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and their wives.

Some of the homes with high lead levels have had lead service lines "disturbed" in some way, meaning the pipe was rattled when street work was done or when a pipe was repaired.

They managed to change the narrative from one about Obama making a concession and agreeing to a provision in the bill to speed the approval process for an oil pipeline to one about stonewalling House Republicans, who have spent much of the year holding the upper hand of divided government.
The renter was looking for help. His former landlord had sued him for nearly $10,000, contending that he'd significantly damaged his unit before leaving even though he insisted he hadn't.
