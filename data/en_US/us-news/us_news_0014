PSA: There are fans of AirCal and Western Air Lines and others in Southern California. But I took my first solo plane trip on PSA in the 1960s and planes with smiley faces, as well as flight attendants in hot pants and boots, make quite an impression on a 14-year-old boy.

In response to this unrelentingly snowy January, I'm choosing, as Song of the Day today, one of the sunniest songs I know: "Golden," from Jill Scott's great and frequently underrated 2004 album, "Beautifully Human: Words and Sounds, Vol. 2." (Her 2000 debut album was "Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sound,s Vol. 1").

Small is beautiful: Maryvale Baseball Park. The big, slick parks in Glendale and at Talking Stick are getting all the buzz, but many baseball fans speak warmly of the smaller, older parks around the area. Bill Plunkett, the Angels beat writer for the Register, enjoys Maryvale Baseball Park, the spring training home of the Milwaukee Brewers. It's in a somewhat scruffy neighborhood in the west side of the city, but it has loads of charm as one of the smallest parks in the league – holding a little more than 7,000 fans. The Brewers are negotiating with the city for renovations of the practice facilities, but overall it's unlikely the Brew Crew will move out.

But those are the extreme examples. For half the cities statewide, the latest estimates for July 2009 were within 3 percent -- plus or minus -- of the official count nine months later.
Losing that money has got to hurt a laudable organization that provides critical services to the poor of Sacramento. Money is scarce in the state capital, as we all know.
"Variables such as the texture of the almond flour, the temperature and state of the sugar, the moisture content of the egg whites, and the viscosity of the macaron batter," Tian writes, "as well as random environmental variables such as ambient temperature and humidity, can all play a crucial role in macaron baking."

Dr. Theodore Chu noted that "lack of pricing (and payments) results in lack of competition, which is one of the causes of increases in health care costs. ... It's a complicated subject, but contrary to the opinion of some, there are practicing doctors out there who are interested in keeping costs down and are working for the benefit of the patient."
The existence of Kuelap has been publicly known for more than a century. But in contrast to Machu Picchu, which became an international sensation after a Yale explorer, Hiram Bingham, declared its "discovery" in the early 20th century, Kuelap's isolation long thwarted serious research. Waves of determined looters and the curious carted off bones and other remnants.

NEW YORK -- One World Trade Center, the monolith being built to replace the twin towers destroyed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, claimed the title of New York City's tallest skyscraper on Monday, as workers erected steel columns that made its unfinished skeleton a little more than 1,250 feet high, just enough to peek over the roof of the observation deck on the Empire State Building.
Joining the UConn contingent on the team is two-time Olympic gold medalist Tamika Catchings. Also returning for a second straight Olympics are Candace Parker, Seimone Augustus and Sylvia Fowles.

On the hoppiness scale, this is by far the leader of the pack among these three red brews. Green Flash calls Hop Head a red India pale ale, which is an accurate description. The reddish-copper color is the only thing that really resembles the other red ales in this group; the aroma and flavor are hops all the way, thanks in part to the beer being dry-hopped with bitter, citrusy Amarillo hops.

Carpenter's appearance meant the end of Jake Westbrook's first start of the season. Westbrook became the second Cardinals starter to complete seven innings as he held the Reds to one run (it was unearned) off seven hits and four walks. All four of the walks came in the first two innings. After that Westbrook settled in, got some help from his defense, and zoomed ahead to 21 outs on a frugal 88 pitches.

The Art of Shaving was created by Myriam Zaoui, a French-born cosmetics chemist who in 1996 cooked up balms in her kitchen to sooth her husband Eric Malek's razor rash. The couple sold their car for $12,000 to open a shop in the Upper East Side of New York City, then hit pay dirt signing a barber from the famous British shop Truefitt & Hill to offer shaves. Once that hit the front page of the New York Times, lines to get in stretched out the door.

Our endorsement comes after discussions with city officials and finance experts who assured us this was no back-door scheme to privatize city assets. They also convinced us that many potential trust deals - such as retrofitting buildings to be more energy efficient - probably couldn't be done with traditional public financing. In many instances, the city still will use traditional municipal bonds, but privately financed deals open up a new world of capital. Though they potentially feature higher interest rates, they bring efficiencies and better allocation of risk that could drive down costs.
"Just a few months ago, President Obama told an Ohio television station that the economy's 'trajectory' was 'a good one,' Romney said in a campaign press statement. "Since then, Ohio's unemployment rate has gone up and families are facing an uncertain future.

That is why I am running and I look forward to working with these leaders in Ohio to get our economy growing again."
Viaduct Lounge does wonders with ingredients most kids would hate. A liver-loving companion wanted to try Viaduct's chicken liver special. I braced myself and took a bite.

Big flavors in the accompanying cheddar-jalapeno grits, studded with bits of house-made bacon, finished off a winning combination.

The current repurchase program has 2.2 million shares yet to be purchased.
I was left with pounds of leftover grilled eggplant after a photo shoot, and although eggplant is my favorite vegetable, grilling it is my least-favorite preparation. Without breading and frying the eggplant, I worried that the dish would be soggy and lack form. I layered the bread crumbs with the eggplant to give the vegetable that familiar breaded flavor and a little crunch. I proceeded with my usual preparation, minus some cooking time, and the result was remarkably close to the original.

We knew her as the possessor of an electrifying pop voice — a singer so skilled she could take “The Star-Spangled Banner” to the Top 40.

But today, none of the candidates seems completely prepared to grapple with what to do next. Some repeat falsehoods as if they were gospel: Los Angeles County's jails are overcrowded (false; they are at about half capacity). California's recidivism rate is 70% (meaningless, without distinguishing between a new criminal offense that should land an offender back behind bars and a technical parole violation, such as failing to report to an agent in time). Realignment puts parolees on our streets unsupervised (a blatant falsehood). State prisoners are being released early under realignment (false). But it's true that if prosecutors, the courts and the sheriff are not careful, they will release people whom they should keep. And it's true that under realignment, more jail inmates (as opposed to prison inmates) may be unsupervised upon release.

Ms. Setnick was a bridesmaid in a wedding and didn't think she needed to bring one for the evening. Her mother felt otherwise. "It was like a clash of wills," Ms. Setnick recalls. "Who was going to capitulate?"

To some Americans, this agenda will seem ambitious. To others, it may seem frightening. But House leaders believe their main risk is appearing too timid to their own members. Even if this three-part strategy proceeds with efficiency and success, in two years it will result in a budget freeze, an unsuccessful guerrilla campaign against health reform and the bare beginnings of the entitlement debate. Will Tea Party revolutionaries view this as victory? Will they be tempted by the Ross Perot option -- a third-party movement that would increase the odds of Obama's re-election?
The music of Dylan and Guthrie has been used prominently in "Occupy" protests across this country and at game-changing political uprisings in other countries. And these projects surrounding their work come just in time for what looks to be an exceptionally volatile presidential election year, one that comes on the heels of last year's Arab Spring protests that toppled long-entrenched repressive governments in several countries and helped foment myriad "Occupy" demonstrations in the U.S. and abroad.

Acapulco, Mexico, is especially strong this year, Celko said, drawing students from East and West coasts. (It accounted for about 25% of STA's spring-break packages sales this year; a typical package costs $500 for round-trip airfare and four nights' shared lodging.)

"To make the product, beef companies use beef trimmings, the small cuts of beef that remain when larger cuts are trimmed down. These trimmings are USDA inspected, wholesome cuts of beef that contain both fat and lean and are nearly impossible to separate using a knife. When these trimmings are processed, the process separates the fat away and the end result is nutritious, lean beef. It’s a process similar to separating cream from milk."

One of the best appetizers is the Napoleon ($10) that features layers of sage polenta, tomato confit, eggplant, zucchini, red pepper piperade and a cap of goat cheese, all molded in a cylinder. It's kind of a New Age ratatouille; the fresh flavors evoke the Provencal countryside.

And then it could also be just some of my other tunes that I play with my other groups arranged for the strings, or old standard songs. I'm not sure what all there's going to be. There's a lot we can choose from, actually."
"We've been struggling away with this gallery for nearly two years now," says Sanday at another bas-relief, one depicting a figure believed to be Jayavarman VII leading his troops into battle.

On Saturday, the archive will screen 1945's "Flame of the Barbary Coast," one of the medium-budgeted films John Wayne made at Republic Studios, and which is often described as the poor man's version of "San Francisco." "Granted," Seid admits, "Wayne's movie is a tepid depiction of Barbary Coast debauchery, and the earthquake sequence never quite achieves the spectacular.

These lightweight, collapsible headphones have two forehead-slapping ideas that make them exceptionally well-suited for travel: a fabric-covered cord with a remote mike, and volume control that makes them compatible with most smart phones and iPads; and a jack in the right earpiece for sharing music with another set of headphones. The fabric cord is nearly impossible to tangle, the headphones collapse, and the jack for sharing music negates having to carry around (and lose) a headphone splitter from Radio Shack. Despite the cartoonish solid colors, the sound quality is serious and the padded earpieces shut out most noise.

That fact about the Brownie I mentioned above appears at least three times in captions. There is talk of George Eastman; there is talk of the other photographers who rushed to the scene, and what they did, and yadda yadda.

Faust’s emergence as an athletic stopper and increasingly reliable scorer, meanwhile, boded poorly for Parker’s 2012-13 prospects, as did the likely return of the injured Howard and this summer’s arrival of a sizable recruiting class.

It's good that Ann Romney had choices. She made them honorably and raised a great family.

Perhaps, but this one ended up being overripe and slightly ammoniac. This was probably due to the lack of circulating air, I learned after the fact.

Those themes were ratcheted up in the crawfish etouffee ($7.95/$14.95). It is a stew of the regionally revered mudbugs that is based on a light roux. For a light roux, the oil and flour are cooked for less time, meaning the mix develops less color and flavor but has increased thickening power. The flavors of the meat and stewed vegetables were good enough that I might argue that an entree-sized bowl is reasonable at $15, but the small cup we tried seemed overpriced at $8.

In architecture, the public thinks of us as being specialists, too. We -- Allied Works -- know a lot about museums. But also we've done Pixar's animation studio. The truth is that architecture relies much less on expertise than other professions. Architects know that but the public doesn't. It keeps the illusion of expertise because that allows them to understand the world better in that way.

Subsequent San Francisco building code overhauls in 1939, 1956, 1975, 1984, 1990 and 1992 greatly advanced building and fire safety. And even though a San Francisco program mandated strengthening of unreinforced masonry, or URM, buildings in 1986, which has worked through about 90 percent of the city's nearly 2,000 brick buildings, legacies of the 1906 quake and fire remain. There are still thousands of hastily rebuilt unreinforced masonry buildings cheek-by-jowl with wooden structures with no fire-resistant walls between them.

Without resorting to Wellesian cinematic techniques for telescoping character into convenient rosebud epiphanies, the movie, and especially Barrie himself, somehow feels shallow, mysterious and inscrutable. Or maybe it's just that we Americans want it all explained for us, wrapped up in a convenient package with shiny ribbon, and it was Welles who discovered the screen language that would do the trick.

Natanz is the centerpiece of Iran's efforts to make its own nuclear fuel. But Iran said earlier this week it was expanding some operations to a bunker-like site south of Tehran protected under 300 feet of rock.

Our budget situation is not a Beaverton problem; it is an Oregon problem. Districts throughout the state have been faced with similar budget challenges. Beaverton has reduced budgets by $105 million, largely sparing schools from deep cuts. We have used the ending fund balance and other one-time savings, negotiated employee concessions, reduced infrastructure and central office personnel, and minimally reduced the workforce through staff attrition to balance the budget. Many of these past options are no longer available.

Midwest Generation also gets an extra year to decide what to do with its Waukegan coal plant, 40 miles north of Chicago on Lake Michigan.
