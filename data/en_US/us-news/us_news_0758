We need a good fight. I'm not talking about idiotic name calling, Hobbits and terrorists, Marxists and enviro-fascists. No, we need a good fight to determine where we go from here. When the 2012 elections roll around, we'll be $17 trillion in debt. The editorial claims that now is not a good time to stop spending, and I can guarantee you that, if the economy gets rolling, there will be editorials that claim that it isn't a good time to stop spending because of the risk of backsliding into a recession. I believe that the best time to stop spending is when you're spending more than you have.
Meanwhile, other fairgoers are busy with horse races, cockfights, cow-butchering demonstrations and other farm-themed activities. Beer flows freely and the aromas of roasted pork and beef fill the air. It's not necessarily the best event for those with weak stomachs, but is a side of Cozumel few outsiders experience and a glimpse into the island's history and traditions.

Why, for example, does Pidgeon send her top agent into a top-secret archive to get a highly classified report which she knows reveals — absolutely nothing? Why does Willis break into someone’s home to hold a family hostage — and then leave without accomplishing anything? Why am I still sitting here an hour-and-a-half later, watching this?
It was in February, during his first state-of-the-city address, that DeGeeter announced he would start the Mayor’s In, Mayor’s Out program.
Oddly, it's only when Chaon revisits the unsavory types that populated his 2009 novel "Await Your Reply" that the book fails to connect. In the pitch-dark "St. Dismas," an amoral 23-year-old describes the aftermath of a well-intended kidnapping of the son of a meth-addled woman he briefly dated, only to be uncertain of his next move at his hollowed-out family home in Nebraska. For the only time in the book's fuzzily interconnected arc of struggle and uncertainty, the story's voice never comes into its own, and the results feel slight against the rest of "Stay Awake's" intricately drawn cast.
And city officials are hopeful for next year. "We still have room to improve," Cole said. "There are lots of ways to increase foot traffic to area restaurants that didn't feel the bump this year. At the end of the day, for a first year event, it was tremendously successful."

Brunetti, however, challenged the decision, which led to a hearing on the dispute last Monday. A key issue was whether political contributions made by Brunetti unfairly had taken him out of the running because of the state’s pay-to-play restrictions.
"We strayed off and started talking about baseball situations," Johnson said. "The little things you need to do within the game to help your team win ballgames, whether it's breaking up a double play or keeping an inning alive by hustling down to first base. I think everybody notices the obvious things, the big home run or the big RBI late, but you never realize what set up that inning.
Frank, who has written for the Silk Road Project,Yo-Yo Ma's world music ensemble, explains that her musical flights of imagination were launched by her father, who read Twain to Frank and her brother, a neuroscientist, when they were kids. Her father, an inveterate bodybuilder, also introduced her to fables and myths. Frank's favorite were tales of the Chaski, Inca messengers who dashed from town to town in the Andes.
Teachers "look at this as a hammer, a sledgehammer, and they're scared about it," she said. "They're schoolteachers; they're private individuals.... They're not public figures. And they just woke up one day and 6,000 names were going to be in the newspaper."
His mother, an educator and civil rights activist, wouldn't have wanted him to dwell on the negative, though, he said.
Because the Justice Department shrouds America's extradition program in intense secrecy, it is usually impossible to determine what goes wrong in specific efforts to capture border-crossing fugitives. The Rodriguez-Mena case, though, helps lift a veil on a clandestine world.

Mama Sue's menu represents the concept well, with hot links, pork chops, all kinds of chicken, appropriate sides (black-eyed peas, creamed corn, rice and gravy, potato salad) and traditional desserts (peach cobbler, banana pudding, sweet potato pie). Just about everything is made from scratch, Williams said, and it tastes like it.
It was the second perfect game in the majors this month alone, unheralded Dallas Braden doing it for Oakland against Tampa Bay on May 9. It's the first time in the modern era that there were a pair of perfectos in the same season - Colorado's Ubaldo Jimenez threw a no-hitter, too, in April.

One way to bring health back to the Willamette was to help it be wild again, a piece at a time, natural resources leaders thought. Find sections where levees could be knocked down, channels reopened, and native trees and shrubs planted. Let the river rise and fall naturally. This "string of pearls," as one environmentalist calls them, would become an oasis.

Maybe it's a good time to ask it. Not only has the Transportation Security Administration been with us for a decade, but it's also the one-year anniversary of the unpopular pat-down rule, when officials arbitrarily decided to either send air travelers through its new body scanners or frisk them. A citizen-initiated petition on the White House website encouraging the government to eliminate the agency is gaining momentum, having collected tens of thousands of signatures.

BROADFORDING CHRISTIAN (4-3)
Who they watching? No matter where 6-11, 258-pound Mitch McGary from Indiana played, coaches followed. Just call him "Big Block" because he plays as if he has a big block Chevy engine in his chest. McGary's game has been compared to former North Carolina All-American Tyler Hansbrough. In reality, the comparison is to Hansbrough's motor, which was nonstop, because McGary is far and away a better offensive threat than the former Tar Heel, both facing the basket, with his back to it, and putting the ball on the floor. Time will tell if he can draw as many fouls from the opposition as Hansbrough, but with his relentless style of play, he should.

Anyone with memories has ghosts. We are all haunted.
Writing in the New York Times in 1990, critic and writer Luc Sante noted that Ballard's "novels are complex, obsessive, frequently poetic and always disquieting chronicles of nature rebelling against humans, of the survival of barbarism in the world of mechanical efficiency, of entropy, anomie, breakdown, ruin."

UO offense vs. UCLA defense: The Bruins are coming off a 50-0 loss to arch-rival USC in which they allowed 572 yards of total offense. That performance dropped them from the upper half of the conference in total defense to eighth in (411.9 yards per game). Teams obviously move the ball well against UCLA and once they reach the red zone, scoring is highly likely. UCLA ranks 11th in red zone defense, allowing teams to score 91.1 percent of the time. The Bruins do have some playmakers on defense. Linebacker Pat Larimore is 17th in the conference with 6.2 tackles per game. Defensive back Andrew Abbott has four interceptions. But UCLA has just 13 sacks (11th ranked) on the season and is tied with Oregon State for seventh in scoring defense (30.8).

In a general election, the prospect for a traditionalist like Santorum would likely be even more problematic. Communities used to meet at bowling alleys; now Facebook is the nation’s gathering place. There used to be jobs for high school graduates with strong arms and stamina; now, the pickings are slim for workers without some kind of education beyond 12th grade. The typical woman once centered her life around home and family; now, most women work, whether from choice or necessity. America was once predominantly white and Christian; now, it is browner and more diverse.

Those of you with long memories may remember the original incarnation. The first PEOPLExpress launched in 1981, from its main base at Newark. It initially flew to just a handful of cities in the Northeast and Midwest, but grew rapidly to reach as far as Florida, the West Coast, London, Brussels and Montreal. Initially, service was all-coach, with just two fares on each route: peak and off-peak. Later, however, it added first-class seats and applied a more complicated "revenue management" fare structure. It was the first U.S. airline to charge for checked baggage and to charge for onboard soft drinks. I flew it twice -- from Newark to Columbus, Ohio early in its life, later on an inexpensive "first-class" trip to London.
WASHINGTON -- Orders for long-lasting factory goods fell by the largest amount in three years last month, mostly because demand for commercial aircraft plummeted. But companies also ordered less machinery and other equipment, a sign manufacturing output may slow.

Such rhetoric is eerily reminiscent of that with which religiously affiliated opponents of African-American equality once defended segregation. It wasn't all that long ago that some of them argued against school integration because, they alleged, black adolescents were uniquely unable to control sexual impulses and, therefore, would assault white schoolgirls. Exhortations against "race mixing" were commonplace pulpit messages short decades ago, though we now recognize them as hate speech. It's past time to do the same with rhetoric that denigrates gays and lesbians.

Voters say they want Washington to tackle deep deficit reductions, and both parties are responding -- Obama with his plan to cut $4 trillion, and House Republicans with a plan they passed last week that seeks to cut $5.8 trillion in spending over 10 years.

"Alegria" (2003): The first performance here that fully incorporated Old World circus sensibilities with Cirque's signature New Age aesthetic. With energetic acrobats, a Russian high-bar act and a contortionist from Mongolia, it stretched the boundaries of what the human body can do. Its distinctly melancholy clowns lent heart and warmth, particularly in a breathtaking sequence that turned the entire big top into a blizzard of white confetti. The score by Rene Dupere is easily the finest yet written for a Cirque show. A-

Democrats in Congress said they would demand provisions in the bailout measure to protect people in danger of losing their homes as well as seeking to cap executive compensation at firms who get to unload their bad mortgages debt onto the government.

Despite that optimism, international efforts to prosecute leaders have been spotty at best. Slobodan Milosevic died in his cell before a verdict could be reached on charges of fomenting the Balkan wars. Moammar Gadhafi was killed by rebels last year before he could be turned over for trial. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is defying attempts to arrest him on genocide charges.

Gallinari is considered the steal of the deal that sent Anthony to the New York Knicks. Gallo can shoot from distance, slash to the hoop and survey the court with uncommon vision. His life is good.

Generosity is an important element of "Rez Life" because of both the voices Treuer works into the narrative and the depth to which he reveals himself. Still, it is not, for all its intimacy, a memoir, just as it is not exactly a work of reportage or a work of history. Rather, it is a nuanced hybrid, broken into six chapters, each of which begins in the personal, then expands outward to a larger theme. Sovereignty, fishing, treaty rights, the tribal justice system, education, language and assimilation — Treuer examines all of it, finding associations between the broadest stories and the most individual.
To wait until next year to fill the vacancy would leave the district underrepresented during at least part of the 2012 session. Nixon could leave the seat vacant until it comes up for regular election in 2012 (the primary will be on Aug. 7 and the general election on Nov. 6, the winner of which would take office in January 2013), but that would leave the 15th without a House member for the entire 2012 session, an even more unacceptable option.
The irony of austerity measures is that they are triple-stupid. They deprive a hurting citizenry of a safety net that is sorely needed in hard times while doing nothing about employment. Therefore tax revenues remain low and even draconian cuts in government spending fail to make up that difference. The deficit barely shrinks or continues to grow anyway. We are seeing this exact scenario play out in Europe, where political turmoil has arisen and unemployment remains over 20 percent in some countries. The U.N.'s International Labor Organization has slammed Europe for this counter-productive approach.
After NBA commissioner David Stern called Irving's name, the 19-year-old hugged his father, Drederick, embraced other members of his party and placed the wine-and-gold cap on his head.

Cover the top with plastic wrap and chill the mixture completely. (Some cooks line the baking pan with plastic wrap and after the mixture has cooled turn it out onto a counter using the wrap as a device to get the mixture out of the pan.
