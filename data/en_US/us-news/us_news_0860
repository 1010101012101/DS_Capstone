Sanctioned and unsanctioned visual practices coexist, bleed together. We see it in this recent pair of photos, too. In the first, one soldier leans intently over the insurgent body, ignoring the camera, while the other soldier, with the dead man's hand resting limply on his shoulder, turns his sweaty face away from it and smiles. In the second photo, some of the Americans are occupied with something beyond our view, while a few of their comrades insert themselves awkwardly into the frame behind the legs of a corpse, which the Afghan police suspend by its ankles, one looking impassively at the camera, the other gazing downward and intent at the remains. For all the clarity with which the pictures depict the viscera of the dead and the faces of the men sent to sort them out, they also testify to the murkiness of the boundary between visual practices that are sanctioned and those that are not. They document the ease with which a visual mission can devolve.

It's an open-cell sponge that easily attaches to an extension pole (not included). It comes with a curved one for the rounded part of your gutter and a flat one for underneath. I used just soap and water, but there are several cleaning products Kovarik recommends including Streak Getter and Gutter Zap. I was able to easily reach and scrub the gutters. It worked like a dream. Within 30 minutes, the whole front of my house was done; making me wonder why I waited so long to do it. Kovarik also invented a similar product for siding - you know, the under parts that the power washer can't seem to clean. That will be my next purchase.

“They shot 57 percent (in the second half), so the breakdown was everywhere,” Joseph said. “Lack of communication, not having our hands up on shooters, bad closeouts … any time a team shoots the ball that well there has to be something wrong defensively.

The movie is a little predictable, at times – complete with a somewhat forced ending and that awful, on-the-nose title. But the acting is all easy and natural.

With a base at 7,000 feet and a top of 8,700 feet, this place gets a ton of snow, and so it was on our recent visit. The snow was so deep, only the main runs were getting groomed, which kept traffic pretty heavy on these runs at times. For those who ventured into the trees and put their rockers to the test, it was work, but well worth it to experience the near-solitude.

When the attacks on 9/11 occurred, I was at work in Baltimore on a teleconference with Price Waterhouse in D.C. and the New York Office of Foreign Labor Certification. My son, who was at school in Pennsylvania, called and interrupted the conference. He was in shock and asked me if I knew what was happening. At the same time, both the D.C. and N.Y. contacts in my teleconference began to get confused and frantic and we discontinued the conference. Our building was on alert and we were evacuated. Just like everyone else, I was frightened that we were under attack.
The lead role of downwardly mobile mistress Hester Collyer is a meaty one, and Rachel Weisz sinks her teeth into it. But the social drama surrounding her is as dated as fallout shelters and powdered-milk rations.
The campaign-as-warfare metaphor may seem sensible to those inside the hothouse. It may make sense if you think today's swing voters hunger for more combat, more harshness and more attack. But it's probably bad sociology and terrible psychology, given the general disgust with conventional politics. If I were in the campaigns, I'd want to detach from the current approach and change the nature of the campaign. If I were Obama, I'd play to his personal popularity and run an "American Idol" campaign: likability, balance, safety and talent. If I were Romney, saddled with his personal diffidence, I'd run a plumber campaign: You may not love me, but here's four things I can do for you.

If you've ever indulged in a glass of the fortified sweet wines port or Madeira, chances are that Rupert Symington had something to do with it. Symington's ancestors first produced port in 1652; today, the Symington Family Estates portfolio includes Graham's, Warre's, Dow's, Smith Woodhouse, and Cockburn's as well as the Madeira labels Blandy's, Cossart Gordon, Leacock's and more. In recent years, this historic conglomerate has been updating its image with dry table wines from Portugal's Douro Valley and single-vineyard ports, without giving up its age-old tradition of farming some of the world's most challenging vineyard terrain in the most natural way possible. When Symington recently swung through town, we asked the Anglo-Portuguese wine-biz whiz about the current state of fortified wines.

southern California one Advent Sunday. The sanctuary was filled with folks longing for Rev. Robert Schuller's usually upbeat proclamation. As the service began, an announcement was made regarding the church's then-legendary "Glory of Christmas" pageant. The show, now discontinued because of the Cathedral's financial problems, was a full-featured theatrical production with angel's flying through the air, orchestrated musical numbers, and a cast of hundreds. Schuller sold the show with his dynamism, his voice thundering: "And there are camels!" On his cue, large adult camels walked down the sanctuary's center aisle. But he still had one more card up his pulpit robe. Grinning from ear to ear, he announced that the church was flying in actual shepherd boys from Palestine.

The morning I visited recently, there was a 45-minute wait to buy Butterbeer, which tastes like shortbread and butterscotch, and a 35-minute wait just to get into a shop -- Ollivander's Wand Shop where wands are sold, following a presentation in which one person is chosen to demonstrate just how the wand chooses the wizard. (Does the wand water the flowers when you point it? Move the ladder?)

Miami is in play too. Dolphins owner Stephen Ross is infatuated with stars, and his team has attendance problems of its own.

According to federal data, the head honchos of the big health insurers fared splendidly in 2009 while other Americans had to make do. For instance, their CEOs' compensation was $18 million at Aetna; $13.1 million at WellPoint (Anthem); and $8.9 million at UnitedHealth.

Irony of ironies: The version we got could prove, in the long term, to be a bonanza for those same fat-cat insurers.

"Given the circumstances Pat came in on, I think he did okay. I really do. For a first time head coach excited and everything and having to go through the lockout, and with a young team and with the injuries that took place and the Peyton Hillis thing that we talked about. All in all, he probably had to deal with things he never thought in his wildest dreams he'd have to deal with. I know this about Pat Shurmur: he's a bright guy, he has a tremendous work ethic, he knows football, he communicates well with the players and I think having Brad Childress as an offensive coordinator will really help because it frees up Pat to do a lot of head coach type things and get a much better picture of the big picture.

Both Middleton and Smotrycz are known as highly skilled offensive players that can “always improve defensively and in toughness and rebounding.” Turgeon, McCormick said, is the perfect coach to bring out those qualities in Smotrycz.

But affordable, safe and full diagnosis starts with the training of our next doctors, in medical schools. It extends to working doctors whose fee-for-service business model now pays them more every time they assign a new test.

But if there's anything to learn from the stories of families devastated by killings, from neighborhoods shattered by violence, and from a city desperate for a leader to tilt against those ills, it's that Detroit Works' original mission should top the mayor's agenda.

African Queen re-launched in Key Largo -- Visitors to the Florida Keys can again take a ride on the African Queen, the iconic original vessel from John Huston's classic 1951 film by the same name starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. Registered as a national historic site, the African Queen recently received a major $70,000 restoration project that included structural, mechanical and cosmetic repairs. The African Queen has an interesting 100-year history that began when it was built in 1912 at England's Lytham shipbuilding yard. Originally named the Livingstone, it served the British East Africa Rail Company shuttling cargo, hunting parties and mercenaries on the Ruki River. Situated in the northwestern Democratic Republic of the Congo until 1968, according to Jim Hendricks Jr., Huston saw it and the vessel was temporarily pulled from service for the film. In 1982, late attorney (and Bogart buff) Jim Hendricks, Sr., discovered the vessel languishing in an Ocala horse pasture and purchased the piece of movie history for $65,000. An equal amount of funds was invested to get the boat operational and Hendricks began offering visitors rides in 1983 while the vessel was home ported at Key Largo's Holiday Inn. In 2001, the African Queen's engine broke, was never fixed and yet it remained on display for curious tourists and film buffs to view. Last year, Captain Lance Holmquist and Suzanne Holmquist signed a long-term lease with Jim Hendricks' son to restore and operate the vessel again. The Holmquists have overseen repairs and have taken pains to date it as it appeared in the film. Plans for the African Queen include offering 90-minute canal cruises several times daily and dinner cruises on selected nights, all from the Holiday Inn Key Largo, mile marker 100 ocean-side, on the Florida Keys Overseas Highway. Costs are $39 per person for the daytime cruise, $25 for children under 12 and the dinner cruise is $89 per person, including the meal. Call 305-896-8004.

He was a teen idol in the early ’40s — as big a teen idol as the world had ever seen. But by the end of that decade, the hits stopped coming and some — even Sinatra himself, briefly — believed he was washed up. But, sparked by an Oscar-winning performance in the 1953 movie “From Here to Eternity” and by the talents of some new musical collaborators (including, crucially, the Jersey-born arranger Nelson Riddle), he re-emerged as a more mature but equally thrilling recording artist and concert performer.

The profitable solution to both manufacturers and buyers in the '70s was the compact car.

She's concerned that those kids "are just as threatened and in jeopardy as Josh" because of the anxiety caused by all the litigation George has brought.

Tinker goes to camp: Legendary Nike/Jordan Brand shoe designer Tinker Hatfield has his imprint on some of the best known footwear produced inside the berm at the Beaverton-area world headquarters. He is perhaps best known for collaborating with Michael Jordan on several of the shoes in the Jordan Brand collection. But Hatfield has spread his wings elsewhere, most recently in designing the playing surface of the Matthew Knight Arena on the University of Oregon campus. And, Sandpoint Magazine reports, he designed Camp Hatfield at Oden Bay in Idaho as a gift for his wife, Jackie, who always dreamed of being a camp director. One highlight: when he describes the origins of the name "Tinker." The other is when he answers the question: What's the best part about working for Nike, and what's the worst part?

Neither rider in the Jeep was hit in this burst of gunfire and they then drove into the tunnel, officials said.
Yet South Carolina voters want to hear about these issues, and in depth. If Iowa showed anything, it is that in this age of Obama and high unemployment and terror threats, even cultural conservatives are voting on more than faith. That explains the growing fight over whether Mr. Santorum should have won the recent endorsement of a group of 150 social conservative leaders—or whether the nod should have gone to Mr. Gingrich. The social right is as split as anyone.

WR Hakeem Nicks. As aggressively as the Seahawks’ corners were playing, I’m surprised the Giants didn’t look more often for the back-shoulder throw that was so effective against the Cardinals. They did it once to Nicks for 16 yards in the third quarter, but not so much other than that. Nicks, by the way, becomes a much different player in the red zone. That’s why he’s getting this game ball. Another tremendous grab on the TD, which is usually when he makes his best catches.
Commas seem to be the persistent problem, Frost said. That is, they are seldom used.

Funny thing, as different as each level is -- and there is a considerable gap between playing with the De Soto Parks traveling team in a tournament at Jackson and playing with the Gallagher premier squad in the national tournament finals at Phoenix -- the challenge always is the same for a goal scorer -- get open, get the ball, get the shot off.

No fancy, artsy pizzas here! There are only about 7 toppings available at Farinacci Pizza, but in this case, less is more. We opted for a plain cheese as well as the deluxe, which includes sausage, pepperoni, mushroom, onion and green pepper. Anchovies were also offered, which, by a 1-2 vote, I gladly accepted on the side. The crust stood out the most, it was chewy and delicious. The cheese-to-sauce ratio was perfect. The supreme pizza was generously topped, with the spiciness of the sausage nicely balanced by the saltiness of the anchovies. This is classic American pizza.

Her midtown apartment is about two miles from her office downtown. She soon figured that paying to park didn't add up. Then there are the intangibles, like encountering friends, seeing  and smelling  the city in a more intimate way, and the camaraderie she feels with others on bikes. They wave, nod or say hello. When was the last time a motorist on Highway 50 did something like that?

A builder who was constructing a home in the 2000 block of Theresa Court reported Jan. 9 that someone filled a large, roll-away trash bin with so much trash that he was unable to put construction debris inside. He said he found garbage, crutches, filing cabinets and mail, including credit card bills, stuffed inside. Deputies used the credit card bills to trace the trash to an address on nearby Country Field Drive, but the occupant
And certainly not the visitors who flock to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and surrounding areas whenever reports of a new flow emerge, sometimes trekking miles to see molten lava pouring into the ocean, as it was over the winter holidays. Some 150 miles of hiking trails across and around older lava flows in the 333,086-acre park — more than half of which is designated wilderness — also draw many explorers.

The mayhem began 45 minutes before the draft, when Cleveland swapped spots with Minnesota, moving from No. 4 overall to the Vikings' No. 3 spot. Moving up just one spot came at a price - three draft picks as the Browns sent a fourth-, fifth-, and seventh-round selection to the Vikings in order to select Alabama running back Trent Richardson.

The setbacks have FasTracks advocates mulling another tax hike vote, but their polling shows voters are not in the mood, so they had to put it off. And opponents such as libertarian-leaning radio personality Jon Caldara are emboldened by the financial troubles. Caldara got elected to the RTD board before the 1997 Guide the Ride vote, and is cited as one reason for its defeat.

As jaw-dropping as the Amazon's scope is - it represents one-fifth of all river flow on the planet - being on it isn't all that thrilling by itself. It's too huge to think of as a river - in some places twice as wide as Manhattan. It's more like the world's longest inland sea that has a current instead of tides.

Then there's Bill Romanowski (above), then with the Denver Broncos, who was fined $7,500 for spitting in the face of 49ers wide receiver J.J. Stokes.

For decades, many European companies had enjoyed deals that granted them half of the high-quality oil produced in Libyan fields.

In Annapolis, state lawmakers are considering bills to expand gambling in the state, a move supporters say is vital to remain competitive in the Mid-Atlantic region, where states such as West Virginia and Pennsylvania offer both slots and table gambling. State officials are also considering bids for casinos in Baltimore and Western Maryland, which would round out the gaming program under the current law.

In 2005, PepsiCo's food division began a quest to make its Lay's potato chips more appealing to local tastes in Russia. It wasn't easy. Russians still like packaged versions of a Soviet-era snack , stale bread slathered in oil and baked to a crisp.

It helps that director Nancy Carlin prefaces the antiheroic epiphany with strong doses of romantic Balkan music. And with Maggie Mason's Raina, the room's inhabitant, and her mother (Lisa Anne Porter) shrieking like schoolgirls over the Bulgarian cavalry charge, led by Raina's fiance, that scattered the invading, Austrian-led Serbian troops - Swiss mercenary Bluntschli among them (real war, 1885).

Indeed, the administration points to successful efforts to identify those who are receiving unwarranted tax breaks for nonprofits or brownfields, worth a collective $2 million. But that success comes with a key caveat — identifying money the city is owed is not nearly the same thing as collecting it, and that process is difficult. For starters, the city isn't the one that administers the homestead tax credit program. It can forward the names of those it believes are undeserving to the state Department of Assessments and Taxation — and it already does for rental properties — but that state agency is the only one with the power to actually revoke the credits.
"I think the numbers we have in our system are not bad," he said, "but we still need to make sure it doesn't get worse and hopefully improve those numbers."
It makes sense financially for districts to take students, but some school leaders are a little nervous about taking all students.
It was with much puzzlement that I read David Brooks's discussion (9/14/11) of evidence that the great majority of American young adults are depressingly -- indeed, alarmingly -- unable to distinguish right from wrong, confront moral dilemmas or interpret the meaning of life. Puzzlement because of the famous religiousness which so conspicuously distinguishes Amertican culture from that of western Europe.
- Teary-eyed Sandinista leaders bade farewell to the "older brother" of their revolution at a dramatic midnight funeral and President Daniel Ortega declared three days of national mourning.

Nicholson — hair slicked back, in finely tailored suits — is not your father's detached noir detective. The labyrinthine storyline still challenges and surprises. Dunaway is impeccable, giving the performance of her career. Huston, at once charming and creepy, embodies his role and, as the director of 1941's "The Maltese Falcon," brings a palpable sense of history to this revisitation of the genre.
"It’s the money," said Stephen Nacco, executive director of public relations at Brookdale Community College in Monmouth County. "Students will save a lot of money taking a Brookdale class at $118 a credit as oppose to some other university at $600 a credit. An increasing segment of the population is doing that."
The state-owned firms approved by China for an asset freeze were among 40 proposed by the council, diplomats said. Beijing generally opposes economic sanctions and is one of North Korea's few allies.

Alan Shipnuck, SI.com: "There is a new roadmap to 19. Tiger Woods's victory at the Arnold Palmer Invitational is notable for a bunch of reasons, but it may ultimately be remembered as the tournament at which golf's greatest scrambler reinvented himself as a merciless ballstriker. This has profound ramifications for Woods's quest to win five more major championships and accomplish his lifelong goal of breaking Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 career majors."
The truth, of course, is that this state and nation has long kept a balanced budget and managed to care for its most vulnerable residents.
Roadblocks have cropped up along the way. Civil unrest marred a handful of Flowermarts in the 1970s, and a lack of interest (as well as fresh blood) led to its cancellation in the mid-1990s.

Sneakers haven't been just sneakers since 1985. That's when the NBA fined Michael Jordan for wearing his black and red Air Jordans because of uptight rules about shoe colors. Jordan was fined $5,000 for every game he wore them  and he kept wearing them. It created buzz and changed perceptions.
Conforto didn’t experience those losses last season, but he’s heard plenty about them from his teammates. The sweep ended OSU’s hopes of winning the conference title and provided a highlight for Oregon in an otherwise disappointing season.

I had a lot of time to study them, because the place had filled up, and as the sun went down, the wait time for a table increased.

Walker was the same player who said Wednesday he thought the Greyhounds could run on the Buckeyes because their bench was short. In talking after the game, he said he hopes Ohio State wins the national championship.
But what made the claim truly bizarre is that two days later, Mr. Cain branded himself a victim of racism. Specifically, he said some black people are "racist" because they disagree with his politics. So blacks aren't held back by racism, but Mr. Cain is?

Gunther used the church budget to pay for plane tickets and the initial supplies. The group will take with them a large supply of antibiotics, antiparasitics, equipment and medication for surgeries such as splints and cast material.
Then her husband became ill and took a disability leave from his job at Home Depot. Burris, who worked as a customer service and logistics clerk at United Van Lines, saw her hours cut back. She found another job but was laid off from that in January 2010.

I also know several women who have been raped or sexually abused and, with the exception of child abuse in any form, I can't think of a more cowardly or vile crime.
If that's the case, and there's no reason to doubt Dunbar's assessment, then why not control and regulate the market? I can't count how many times I've heard politicians and police officials say that society cannot "arrest its way out of high crime rates."

The last player to hit four home runs in a game was Carlos Delgado on Sept. 25, 2003, for Toronto against Tampa Bay.
That last goal is by far the most important. If the communities of Cuyahoga County -- and their neighbors throughout Greater Cleveland -- can reduce the time and red tape it takes to do business here, this will become a far more attractive place to invest. As the economy becomes more robust and the pie grows larger, squabbles over "poaching" should subside.
Fans and critics have measured the poor guy's words all season, criticizing Cho for being soft spoken and careful with what he says (and who wouldn't be post-Pritchslap Era?). I'm still trying to figure out how much autonomy he really has, and whether he'll be a difference-maker for the organization. But I'm thinking we're going to learn as much as we ever have about Cho in the next seven days.

Contacted Friday, Thomas said she voted for Welo and Kleem, based on a recommendation from the suburban mayors' group, which suggested the mayors two years ago.
"You always look for what's happening in front of you and I was lucky enough that horse (Morgan's Guerrilla) just drifted at the right time, just as I was getting toward him," Russell said. "It just made my job a little bit easier in regards to riding the horse and steering him at the same time."
