At last count, there were 273 people following me on Pinterest — a visual bookmarking site that lets you "pin" and share images of things you deem worthy of sharing — your lunch, say, or a cute bunny. Mind you, I have never actually pinned anything there, which raises the question: If you pin something in a forest and nobody is there to see it, does it make a sound?

* The running bit featuring Armisen and Brownstein as musicians trying to find an audience for their band -- "Portlandia" loves to find comedy in transactions gone awry, from customers who can't get service to purveyors who can't get customers -- starts as they find their gimmick: including Kevin the cat in the band. Kevin, played by Mac the cat (I insist you read about this gifted Oregon feline actor right now), is just what they needed. With Kevin's syncopated, amplified scratching, Cat Nap is an indie sensation. Pitchfork goes mad. We return to Cat Nap as Gathy holds Armisen, Brownstein and Kevin captive. Just when it seems all is lost, Cat Nap has an inspiration -- include Gathy in the band (at a gig at the Bagdad, they introduce her as, "on gun, that's Gathy").
Yet of course, because it's San Francisco we do things delightfully differently here. We don't have just any dildo factory -- we have one driven by a message of sexual pleasure and health, in a drop-dead gorgeous aluminum and curved wall warehouse in Dogpatch, staffed by people with more than a spring in their step and the best working conditions and employee benefits this side of the dot-com boom.

“In recent memory, maybe it was a little more clear-cut with four or five games left,” Notre Dame coach Mike Brey said. “There’s a lot going on right there. We’re certainly very focused on being in position to get a double-bye. It’s something that we’ve talked about with our team to shoot for.”

Kasten was the picture of glum as the Class 2 boys race ended Saturday at Oak Hills Golf Center at Jefferson City. One by one, he gathered his runners as they crossed the finish line and exited the chute. The Blackcats were as bummed as their coach.
Perhaps the greatest catcher of our generation was coming to Detroit and some Tigers fans werent happy about it because of the fact that it displaced Inge. From there, the Inge monster was off and running. Some fans adored him. Some fans loathed him. But I really think the larger issue was between the fan bases themselves. I dont think as many Tigers fans hated Inge as much as they hated the love and adoration that he somehow sparked. He was Detroits long-term version of Tim Tebow. I dont hate Tebow. I just hate the Skip Baylesses of the world who make Tebow out to be a combination of John Elway, Steve Young and Michael Vick (the good part of Vick, not the bad part).

It is an easy-to-navigate little cluster of lodges, hotels, restaurants and pubs that makes for a busy hive of nightlife, but during the day there are few folks on the expansive slopes.

One thing won’t change: Lucier’s dynamite view of the Willamette River.
Make the basic sauce ahead of time; it can stand for a couple of hours if necessary. Whip egg whites, fold in some blanched asparagus and call everyone to the table. A few minutes later accept the "ahhhs" of your guests as you tell them, "It's not hard - I just used a little Magic!"

The three major candidates should agree to raising and spending the same amount of money, say, $75,000 per week for the remaining three weeks of this primary campaign.

The truth is that the headwinds in this race were abundantly apparent long before Richard Mourdock announced his candidacy. One does not highlight such headwinds publically when one is waging a campaign. But I knew that I would face an extremely strong anti-incumbent mood following a recession. I knew that my work with then-Senator Barack Obama would be used against me, even if our relationship were overhyped. I also knew from the races in 2010 that I was a likely target of Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and other Super Pacs dedicated to defeating at least one Republican as a purification exercise to enhance their influence over other Republican legislators.

The bulk of this money would go for construction on underused city lots or land near transit lines. This emphasis should reward the Bay Area where land-use policies promote housing near bus and rail lines, but lack the public subsidies to make it happen.

But I think you could have prevented this from happening, too. Did you take a moment to read your itinerary after you booked your tickets?

Every kid ripped open a fancy package containing a new toy. Then it was my turn. The teacher handed me something that had been wrapped in paper that was clearly reused.

Before taking a seat on the bleachers the morning of the big game, I fed my player pre-game carbs and a pep talk that drew largely on hockey coach Herb Brooks speech before beating the Russians in the 1980 Winter Olympics.

The merchandise can be very good, especially textiles, artwork and jewelry. Food and drink includes spiced wines, teas, roasted chestnuts, sausages and baked goods.

One day, said Tocqueville, the despotism will grow nastier and harder, though some of us figure there are ways to fight back: elect its enemies and start rescinding the bad old regulations and more closely review new ones. The question is whether large numbers of us have already become what Tocqueville feared: too little imbued with individualistic spirit to act purposefully. I hope not.

We traveled between Astoria and Canon Beach, hitting the back roads, snapping photos of ourselves and of the landscape of this wonderful state and beautiful country. Most importantly though, were the people we met along the way. Having served as a Photo-Journalist in the United States Navy for nearly 8 years and being a card carrying member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, I'm fortunate to be able to walk into private clubs like the American Legion, in little towns like Canon Beach, and listen to interesting stories from the 'old salts.' As I'd begin a story about my own experience serving over in Japan on the USS Kitty Hawk CV-63 the drinks would start flowing along with laughter and tears. I don't think I even bought a drink. Those 'old salts' even offered me a place to stay, a kitchen to cook in, and a bathroom to bathe in. Thanks guys! I'll never forget you!

The kitchen still does a fine job with live scallop nigiri (price varies), draping a sweet meaty scallop over rice with a thin slice of lemon, and frying the rest of the scallops with onion strands in tempura-battered shoestrings.

I've identified as an independent most of my adult life. But in Ohio, by voting for candidates in a primary election, I automatically become a party member and can be forced to sign a loyalty oath if I want to change which party primary I vote in for the next election. If I want to remain an independent, I'm excluded from voting for candidates in primary elections altogether, though expected to fund these elections as a taxpayer. That's just one example of how party privilege trumps voter rights in this day and age.

Geoff, who is 51-years-old and has survived one battle round already, thinks he has the advantage over Sera since he grew up on soul music, as if being seven when Aretha cut this track gives him some kind of karmic edge. But you'll recall Christina was so into Sera's sass and vocal versatility that she bound onstage to sing with her, so really it is Geoff who's on the fast track for home. If you think like an A&R man, you realize no one's gonna want to sign an old geezer in sunglasses over a young hot potato like Sera. Geoff's vocal volume might have inspired guest adviser Lionel Richie to title an album "Louder Than Words" if he hadn't already done so. Richie advised Geoff to inject some personality and swagger into the song, and that translated into removing his glasses in the middle of the song. Sera's adviser was Jewel, who told Sera that all Geoff had going for him was volume. Once the battle was over, Blake viewed it as a draw. "Clearly both of you can sing the crap out of that song," he gushed. But he picked Sera because he probably doesn't want to endanger his bromance with Adam by saying Geoff was also very sexy. Cee Lo said Geoff had more soul. Adam totally bought into the specs removal thing. And although Geoff demonstrated considerable soul with his blast-furnace voice, Christina went with her gut (no weight jokes please) and picked Sera who really imbued the lyrics with meaning that extended beyond optometry.

A relief of the Acropolis on the back wall, statues of Zeus and Athena, a full bar and a wonderful bakery attached to it — all signs point to Hellas being the most beloved Greek restaurant in Tarpon Springs. There's no consensus, mind you, but the slowly braised tomatoey lamb shanks, served mysteriously atop spaghetti, are fairly persuasive. Family-owned and within sight of the sponge docks, Hellas has been serving up Greek salads (a scoop of potato salad lurking in their midst) and fat wedges of pastitsio through a couple of generations of Tarpon's hearty Epiphany divers.

Finally, it spells it out for voters: Mr. Portman and other Republican leaders are eager to refight the ugly fights of the last two years even if they can’t prevail. Better to move on.

Mike Lupica, New York Daily News: "Understand something: The overturning of Braun's 50-game suspension doesn't mean Braun is clean, no matter what he says or how many times he says it or what he expects reasonable people to believe. He wasn't exonerated. He was acquitted. There's a difference. So Braun of the Brewers becomes the first positive test to win this kind of appeal in baseball. So he goes on with his career now, and his huge contract, no suspension, because a triple-sealed sample, one that no one ever suggested had been tampered with, didn't make the last FedEx shipment on a weekend, didn't go out until Monday morning. If you want to think justice was served, have at it."

Obama doesn't even seem to understand the ramifications of this concession. Poland and the Czech Republic thought they were regaining their independence when they joined NATO under the protection of the United States. They now see that the shield negotiated with us and subsequently ratified by all of NATO is in limbo.

Frank Lane, Germantown, Tenn: My childhood memories are full of different times I would listen to the Tigers on the radio with my Great Grandpa when we went up north or my Grandma when I visited her. The Tigers were always "Grandma's Tigers. Grandma always knew the right time to make a change in the lineup, either on the mound or any other position.

She always used to say, "I wish he would get a hair cut." When I moved to New York, Grandma clipped every newspaper article about the Tigers and mailed them to me each week. One year I decided she should get a chance to catch a live ball game. After all, she was 73 years old and they were "Grandma's Tigers. We went to Tiger Stadium for an afternoon game. She would have nothing to do with being dropped off at the gate or using her handicap pass to park close. She wanted to walk up. I had gotten Tiger Den seats. She could not believe that they wiped off the seat before we sat down! She was also amazed that we could order food and they would bring it to us!

She agreed, stopped on the way to buy condoms but told him he would have to give her a gift. He asked how much.

When Roy was here, he would take that uncertainty and tentative feelings of his teammates and swallow it for them. He not only put the burden on his shoulders, he delivered while carrying that weight.
That's the way I felt about the 10 courses that followed - a progression of vegetarian, seafood and meat dishes presented one at a time. They included gluten that looked like vinegar-soaked pieces of dark rye bread; shrimp, sweet and slightly crunchy with a mix of red, yellow and green bell peppers; bright soybeans tossed with paper-thin tofu noodles and goji berries; wide, chewy cellophane noodles with thin slices of fried pork; and orange beef that had a crisp, shattering exterior with only a subtle hint of sweetness.

Google immediately called for a mistrial because of Oracle's inability to obtain a verdict that supported the crux of its case -- that Google used Java Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, in a way that was not a "fair use."
What happened in Afghanistan two days ago is not what Islam is about; I am at a loss how these people can profess to be adherent of tenants of Islam and then kill innocent human beings including children. How do they justify these atrocities? How are the lives of these victims expandable for the terrorists' misguided ideologies? Where in Islam suicide bombing is condoned?
Is that easy? No.
City Hall is almost always open to the public, and parties are a regular occurrence. But a formal holiday open house, in the grand 1915 edifice, may be a first, docents said.

We go into our properties with secret shoppers and ask our employees to do three things - we call it "See, Say, Smile." Look customers in the eye. Give them a greeting.

We leveraged our human capital and created a much better experience for our customers.

They suggested more use of home detention and tighter community supervision, steps successful in other states.

The final puzzle has 60 pieces, and I’d like to know how long this actually took to do in real time. Kat’s glad she’s not doing the puzzle, because at least she’s aware of her own limitations, bless her heart. It’s a fairly close race, not that it matters; none of these people were going to be on the block tonight, anyway. And although he hates puzzles, Jay wins immunity.
Having done this job for a long time, I can remember covering three innings of a baseball game in a full-blown blizzard. I recall when a kid doubled to left field because the left fielder never saw the ball. He only moved when he heard it strike the fence. And one of the starting pitcher's hands that day was so cold, it appeared that he had spray-painted it DayGlo red.
But in February 2008, Pettengill said he and his associates learned that Crown Forex was "illiquid." It claimed to have received investor assets of $15 million but had just $1 million remaining, and its management had no control over its finances.

Mankin is Marlene, the older diner waitress who revels in her ability to handle the job and her interactions with her devoted regulars. She and the cook Henry (a solid James Brooks) pretty well run the place, given the lack of interest of owner Matthew (Bora Max Koknar). A cagily ambitious Sarah Mitchell is young new hire Courtney, whose eagerness to learn pleases Marlene - until it threatens her.
After Kuebel flied out, Andrew Pitts picked him up with a run-scoring single through the hole at short. Pitts then moved up to second when the relay throw home got away. Like Floros, No. 6 batter Sam Knesel had been 2-for-13 at the plate this season coming in, but he, too, came through with an RBI single to right-center to make it 3-0.
In a telephone interview last week from Miami, Hiddleston said he had a great time while filming in Cleveland last summer.

She did this as surely as Kurt Cobain armed with a shotgun. As Heath Ledger juggling bottles of prescription pills. Michael Jackson with a toxic syringe. Her demise came as suddenly, and predictably, as Amy Winehouse with a gallon of booze. Billie Holiday wasn’t the first. Poor Whitney won’t be the last.
There were, however, two new faces on the premises making their St. Louis debut. One was guest conductor Semyon Bychkov. He has performed with most of the major orchestras of the world, recorded many award-winning CD's, and makes regular appearances at great opera houses like La Scala, the Met, and Covent Garden. He stands on the podium, feet spread wide, rarely moving them as if they are buried in sand. All the movement is in his upper body and arms, his wrists being the most active part.

Getting there, Keller said, would require investors to pay a price-earnings ratio about equal to the market's long-term average, even as profit growth is slowing.

"We kind of think it's healthy," Haduong says of the diet, "but is it really?"
Metrolink's benefits are for the most part felt only by the tax-subsidized commuters who ride the trains (and Metrolink employees). The system provides next to nothing in terms of freeway congestion relief. Even accounting for recent growth in ridership, data from the FTA and the Federal Highway Administration show that the system accommodates about 0.3% of total passenger miles traveled in the Los Angeles region. Metrolink reports that, on freeways that parallel Metrolink trains, the service diverts a little less than 3% of rush-hour travel volumes. If Metrolink service were discontinued tomorrow and all those passengers got back in their cars, there would be no perceptible change in freeway congestion or travel times.

OK, OK, I'll admit it: I'm a sucker for free books. They're the gift that keeps on giving, a gift the culture gives itself. This makes for an interesting dynamic in a money-driven society such as ours. What is the value of books if they cost nothing? Are they worthless? Or priceless, a gift that literally knows no price?
Kucinich's statement said that "through demonizing prose and a 'with us or against us' mindset, the Washington Post Editorial Board rejoins the march of folly that has in the past decade fueled a misguided approach to conflict resolution and democracy building that has left America with thousands of dead young soldiers, over a million dead civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan and the surrounding region, trillions of dollars of debt, and a new generation of terrorists."

The tax levy reduction may not hold, though. The county could be on the hook to pay oil refining company Sunoco an estimated $3 million for overpaid taxes. Sunoco recently settled its tax appeals with West Deptford Township on the Eagle Point refinery located there. West Deptford settled for $15 million. The county is still attempting to sort out its end of the matter.
Ask for a to-go container when you place your order. Especially when dining at a place known for its ample servings, it pays to immediately transfer half of the entree to a takeout box before you dig in. That removes the temptation to overindulge and reduces the transferring of bacteria from your fork to the uneaten portion. (Just make sure to refrigerate the leftovers in less than two hours, or less than one hour if the room or weather is hot.)

There used to be a place called Relish in Westport, and a little walk-up window on 39th Street, Zahm’s in Merriam and some joint on Santa Fe in Overland Park. But they’re all gone. Kaput. If there’s a Chicago-style hot dog stand in the metro, it must be hiding pretty well.

In a plateau, the capital city is between mountains. Temperate — 60ish degrees. Nice. Except being I’m exceptionally bright, I thought it was hot, tropical, like nearby Panama so I packed only light thin skimpy cottons.
