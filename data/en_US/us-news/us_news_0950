The U.S. is giving us a chance to make a difference. I do believe if we are given the chance, we can excel. ... We will not be underestimated anymore.

Marcus Camby's contract is expiring, and Przybilla's arrival combined with Camby's chronic case of lethargy makes him expendable. Raymond Felton, 1 for 9 against Minnesota, has been awful. He's playing a season-long shooting game named: W-O-R-S-E. Thank goodness Felton's contract is expiring. He's tradable because of it. Felton's sidekick, Wallace, has a player option and has been a blossoming problem, too. The Blazers covet the flexibility those contracts might give them this summer, but I fear if they don't make a deal by the March 15 trade deadline, this season is going to totally derail and McMillan's head is going to come clean off with it.

I was less impressed with the efforts the film makes to push adulthood onto Radcliffe. Is he really that close to the towering Ciaran Hinds in height? Would a boyish working lawyer really address his social superior (Daily) by his first name in that era? (We've all seen "Downton Abbey," for heaven's sake.) Too little effort is spent explaining Arthur's fearless acceptance and seeming understanding of the ghost he sees and pursues.
The Eagles moved up to draft Cox, who many had penciled in to the Panthers with the ninth pick. Cox appears to be an ideal fit in a 3-4 defense and has been compared to Richard Seymour.

His "Bed" is a bed for one.

I describe Android - with more respect than it would appear - as the mobile OS that can't shoot straight. But the thing about people who keep shooting and shooting is that eventually, they do tend to hit what they didn't know they should have been aiming for all along. Don't count them out.
Though the quality of its journalism is well-regarded, ABC News has suffered from a business standpoint during the past decade because it doesn't have a regular cable partner, the way NBC News has MSNBC and CNBC.

Beth and I just got married in January, and one of the things I'm doing is working on our house.

The Yankees starters have so many issues, a little deception could go a long way. David Robertson, who pitched a scoreless eighth inning last night, walking one and striking out two, has great success out of the bullpen, not only because of his stuff, but because he hides the ball in his delivery.

Q: In the spring, I bought a Euphorbia mauritanica (lime-lines) at a local nursery. That nursery recommended it for full sun. For the first four or five months, it looked great, and I was excited to have something a little different in the yard. By August, it started to die. I covered it with shade screen even though it got a little filtered light from a nearby ocotillo. I was ill, since it was a fairly expensive plant. My questions: Is it appropriate for the Valley and will it take full sun? If so, what did I do wrong? It was watered three times a week during the high temperatures.
For many years, Chilean wineries believed Merlot and Carménère were the same varietal. In the early 1990s, however, DNA testing showed Carménère was a different grape.
And that will be the case when he faces Cotto (37-2, 30 KOs) on Saturday night. But Mayweather will be facing a different set of circumstances after this fight is over. Typically he takes a long family vacation after each fight. This time he will be cooling his heels, but not on some sandy beach in the Caribbean. Three weeks after the fight he will be heading to the Clark County Detention Center where he will begin serving a 90-day sentence on a domestic abuse charge on June 1.

Salaries and wages: Projecting a rise in inpatient revenue, MetroHealth hired workers to meet the expected demand, with 166 new full-time-equivalent positions added in the past year. The health system has spent $237.9 million in this category, which is about 8.5 percent more than it spent for the same period last year. Because the hiring was planned, MetroHealth is nearly within budget in this category, with spending $374,000 higher than projected.

Rouches said he's not sure how investigators identified Mandujano-Marin as the main suspect. The witness, Rouches said, told police there were possibly three other suspects – in their early 20s – inside the car, and investigators are looking for them. They reportedly remained inside the vehicle during the attack.
Although Sean Benjamin and Steve Mosqueda were once content to simply settle in at a bar and tell a good story, their ambitions have since expanded. The problem is, their attention to stagecraft has not. Their latest show — a conceptual goof that pits the seven deadly sins against the seven platinum albums of Hall & Oates — feels barely rehearsed, which I suspect isn't an aesthetic choice so much as a matter of circumstance.
The injury-plagued Verplank was atop the board all by himself after rolling in his third birdie of the round, a 10-footer at No. 8. He followed up with a bogey, but was still 5 under at the turn.

A new ad on a major Bay Area radio station is recruiting high-tech employees for positions in Detroit. Talk about insults. San Francisco is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and wretched, cold Detroit is going to seed, literally. Michiganders talk about rural sprawl rather than urban sprawl – so many Detroit neighborhoods have been abandoned and bulldozed that farms are sprouting within the city limits. But despite the fantasies of Gov. Jerry Brown and his fellow Democrats, people will, indeed, leave this magnificent place for less-desirable locales to pursue better economic opportunities.
The con was simple but effective, Dirkin said, with Miller allegedly taking advantage of a mostly reputation-based industry.

The Miller-led probe is said to be close to a settlement, estimated at $20 billion or more. But observers say it has been hampered by banks' demands that it include a liability release. Such a release would give the banks protection from further state investigations like Coakley's. It would also release them from fallout that could come from future federal investigations into their mortgage practices, including faulty paperwork still being found and securitization of loans.

Physicians' concerns that a psychiatric diagnosis could be stigmatizing to a patient have often discouraged some from putting such a finding into that patient's medical record. But such concerns do not help explain the trend found by Mojtabai and Olfson, since the researchers were looking at records in which both patients' and care providers' identities are protected. In the records they reviewed, the researchers declared, physicians "have little motivation to deliberately withhold psychiatric diagnoses."

But R.C. had read his Adam Smith, Bastiat, Mises, Hayek and others, and he was convinced that socialism (let alone communism) was inherently unstable as well as cruel. He helped to promote the few liberty-minded writers, like Ayn Rand, Isabel Paterson and Rose Wilder Lane, who arose during the 1940s, and reprinted the work of more established commentators like Albert Jay Nock. He provided Leonard Read with some of the seed money to establish the Foundation for Economic Education. He distributed pamphlets to everybody he met. He never gave up hope. And eventually a freedom movement grew and increased in influence.
It's an unusual approach, but the world of fashion-based reality shows could use a shake-up. "Project Runway" continues to hold its ground despite a contentious and highly publicized move from Bravo to Lifetime. (Last year's Season 9 of "Project Runway" on Lifetime had an average viewership of 2.8 million people, according to Nielsen.) It has birthed two offshoots, "Project Accessory" and the current "Project Runway All-Stars," in which designers from earlier seasons, such as Michael Costello and Kenley Collins, return to compete.

Their collective bearing suggests the upper rungs of the social ladder, but Violet consciously sets her sights low in the dating game, reasoning that average-looking men make the most grateful boyfriends — or at least so she says.

1. As we said, ignore the score: With the spot of the ball moving around the field for different series, coach Jim Tressel will use a complicated scoring system that awards the offense points for things such as first downs and touchdowns, while the defense scores points for things such as defensive stops and turnovers. It doesn't matter. Tressel often does what he needs to in order to keep the score close.
Just before 8:30 a.m., the group's leaders said police told them the protest couldn't pour into the street in front of the headquarters. So they hit the road, marching through North Portland.

In welcoming the 92 guests to the "What Dreams Are Made Of"-themed affair, event co-chair and LPF Board Chairman Doug Freeman threw out some riveting national statistics. He said 50% of adults cannot read a book written at an eighth grade level and 44 million adults are unable to read a simple story to their children. "We know from experience and national studies," Freeman said, "that illiteracy is a major factor in increased school drop-out rates, juvenile offenses, gang affiliations, and drug use and crime." Going on, he said illiteracy costs American taxpayers an estimated $20 billion each year and school dropouts cost our nation $240 billion in social service expenditures and lost tax revenues. "Our citizenry must be able to read and comprehend to be economically competitive," Freeman finished.

Texas' competitive slumber will be short-lived. Oregon is committed to building the best program Nike can buy. And you know the SEC won't sign off on any new playoff configuration that doesn't include a stipulation for multiple teams from the same conference if they're ranked in the top four.

The sad part is that all of this might have been avoided if the Big East leadership had a clue about football. If only they had listened to their football schools months and years ago and tried expand during a time of strength instead of this time of desperation. UCF coach George O'Leary says the league is fading because it has allowed its basketball-only members to call the shots even though the league's football television contract makes most of the money.

Durocher had been accused of breaking the fan's jaw. Durocher also had been criticized by Brooklyn's Catholic Youth Organization for having an affair with actress Laraine Day, who was married. Durocher and Day married in El Paso, Texas, on Jan. 21, 1947, a day after she obtained a divorce in Juarez, Mexico, from Ray Hendricks.

The home about two miles north of the city's airport has been a nuisance for years. City documents show when inspectors arrived last month they found mounds of trash and fleas and cockroaches vying for space on the walls.

Rovell added a paternalist message with the post: "MSG walking a fine line with this Lin fortune cookie graphic tonight." Rovell, whose Twitter bio starts, "I'm the Emmy Award winning sports business reporter for CNBC," has a Lin jersey as part of his Twitter photo and has ridden Linsanity hard for stories, so maybe he was being protective of a gold mine of story material.
"Before that new rule, we were able to get tax bills out probably by mid-October," Leung said. "But that rule took 30 days off the calendar of getting assessments done and tax bills generated."

In the coming days, if not weeks, Guerra will face what could be the greatest challenge of his brief major league career. As a rookie last season, Guerra was nearly perfect, converting 21 of 23 save opportunities. Never has he had to come back from two games such as these.

One of our report recommendations is for Enterprise Florida to post all meeting agendas, minutes and call-in numbers online. We also suggest that Enterprise Florida begin using an independent return-on-investment calculator to determine the effectiveness of all incentives. The current return-on-investment calculations used by Enterprise Florida are made by a company that received incentives from the organization in the past.

The lack of straight-line speed will limit him however, and when comparing him to first round receivers A.J. Green and Julio Jones last year, I don't think he's in their class. Nevertheless, he's got the skill set to line-up all over an NFL offense and make plays on all levels of the field.
The donation by David H. Koch, the executive vice president of Koch Industries Inc. of Wichita, Kan., is the single largest gift in the museum's 102-year history. The Smithsonian Board of Regents voted Monday to name the new dinosaur hall in Koch's honor.

In "Black Pearl Sings!," currently at Portland Center Stage, the relationship between the two women, white and black, starts unsteadily, but they have something important to give each other, and to take: Pearl wants parole so she can find her lost daughter. And, Susannah, who would impress the men in charge of her project, desperately wants access to those treasured songs Pearl learned from her grandparents: spirituals, work songs and children's ditties, some of which may stretch back as far as the African slave ships. Exploitation becomes an issue that causes sparks to fly as the two negotiate their needs.
One problem: There wasn't enough dynamic variance; the softs, for instance, weren't nearly soft enough. Later in the program, Albert Roussel's Symphonic Fragments from "The Spider's Feast" was more exquisitely rendered: tickling atmospherics, reminiscent of Debussy or Ravel, with silky textures from the orchestra, performing on tiptoe. Denève has been championing Roussel in a series of recordings for the Naxos label, and this was fine-spun stuff -- but a curio, this ballet music, even at 20 minutes in length.
"I didn't know he was a pitcher," Cashner said. "I don't look at a hitter much when I'm pitching. He didn't swing."

Morton, who was born in Atlanta, has nationality options available to him. His mother was born in Nigeria, and he competed for that country in the 2009 world championships, finishing eighth at the end of his freshman year.

Additionally, prior to their meeting, Brown is the guy who shot the iconic photo of a totally relaxed Garcia walking down Haight Street in 1968, guitar in hand, unaware of fame knocking.

Sean Meagher: Despite his declaration of entering the season more relaxed than years past, it was apparent early something was not right with Brandon Roy. Watching him struggle to assert himself and make the plays we all had become so accustomed to seeing from the former all-star was a painful process. His mind was saying yes while his knees were saying no. You have to love his determination saying he wants to be a starter again, but there are so many questions: How healthy can he get? Can he adjust his game to his new physical limitations? Can he be consistent? Can he adjust mentally to not being a starter? What can the Blazers expect next season?

Sixteen cities in San Diego County are looking at lowering pensions for new hires. New public safety workers would get 60 percent of their salaries at age 50 – versus 90 percent under current law.

Last week, administrators running the record 54-time Scottish champions considered Miller their preferred bidder. But Miller said in a statement that he was dismayed by hostility from fans unhappy with the prospect of foreign ownership and that the 140-year-old club's financial situation is worse than he initially thought.
But the general character of the piece is so hyperactive, and the textures so thickly matted, that these points often don't register. And the scarcity of pieces for orchestra and string quartet - the one large and imposing, the other intimate and tonally homogeneous - turns out yet again to be well founded.

For a Newsweek cover article about author William Faulkner, Emerson headed to the Nobel laureate's Mississippi home. Though a sign at the driveway told him to go away, Emerson knew Faulkner sometimes relented. He relished telling the story from there, in many variations: how he ventured up the driveway anyway, attracting first dogs and then a shirtless Faulkner himself, who grumbled a few words and then calmly told someone to get his shotgun.

The price of avocados is steep -- a result of weather, a dwindling number of farmers and, some say, politics. But even if the price settles down, Patricia Wells has a convincing argument for playing with the recipe. Her Guacamole Light uses peas to substitute for some of the fat-rich avocado. While avocados contain good fats, they are still fats, and the peas bring a brighter edge to the mix. We're convinced, after one try. Wells suggests spreading Guacamole Light on whole-wheat toast as a vibrant and satisfying side to salads.

Smart growth, like the change to more efficient autos, takes time. We should have taken serious steps long ago. And conservation must reach down to the individual citizen.

Kevin Cowherd, Baltimore Sun columnist: You knew the NFL was going to come down hard, but this is crazy-hard. Saints coach Sean Payton suspended for a year? Saints GM Mickey Loomis suspended for the first eight regular-season games of 2012? When they're suspending an assistant coach (Joe Vitt) for six games and docking him $100,00, you know Roger Goodell is serious about wiping out "bounty programs" that target players for injury. Good for him. Obviously, this was no slap on the wrist. The league needed to do something to make sure this sort of thing doesn't happen again -- and it did.

Under Christie’s compromise with Sweeney, the governor plans to conditionally veto a bill the Legislature passed last week that would have lowered the property tax cap but include a number of exceptions. The conditional veto would lower the cap further and only allow municipalities to exceed it for costs from health insurance, pensions, debt service payments and states of emergency.

Children don't fall in love with the sport because there is "lots of money in the lacrosse world" or because it is a "beauty contest out there" as Ms. Reimer points out, they fall in love with the sport because it's fun and competitive. Parents start their children's involvement in the sport early, not to foster inter-school rivalries or some sense of personal ambition but because lacrosse, and sports in general, provide a unique opportunity to teach our children lessons that go well beyond the classroom or dinner table. It teaches them respect, sportsmanship and humility.

It was iffy, they said, about whether she would even do the final two dances required for the Tuesday show. But Grey buckled down and delivered the goods, with partner Derek Hough.

It's often a matter of outgrowing the images that you came here with, the dreams that drew you, and replacing them with genuine, observed reality.

Consider this fact: There are two areas in the United States that suffer from the same disease – education is one and health care is the other. They both suffer from the disease that takes a system that should be bottom-up and converts it into a system that is top-down. Education is a simple case. It isn't the public purpose to build brick schools and have students taught there. The public purpose is to provide education. Think of it this way: If you want to subsidize the production of a product, there are two ways you can do it. You can subsidize the producer or you can subsidize the consumer. In education, we subsidize the producer – the school. If you subsidize the student instead – the consumer – you will have competition. The student could choose the school he attends and that would force schools to improve and to meet the demands of their students.
