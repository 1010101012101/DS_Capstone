The only thing the Trayvon Martin and Howard Morgan cases appear to have in common is the biased and inaccurate coverage by the mainstream media.

The Cavaliers have decisions to make between now and July 1 with their current roster in regards to extending $1.1 million qualifying offers to Alonzo Gee, Semih Erden and Luke Harangody.

Instead, the only real winners in 2011 were two devices sold by booksellers: Amazon's Kindle Fire and Barnes & Noble Nook Tablet. They're nifty 7-inch Android-based tablets that sell for less than the cost of an iPhone, and they can handle the basic functions that most gadget buyers expect from color tablets: media, the Web, gaming, and a smattering of non-critical apps.

The formula is intact: An impending wedding brings together buddies for a bachelor party they can't remember and nearly kills them.

"It’s good to see that there has been some improvement in the unemployment rate and that people are starting to get back to work," Portman said. "However, this doesn’t take into account the 3-million-person reduction in labor force participation compared to pre-recession levels. If those people were still counted within the labor force, the unemployment rate would be 10 percent, which is a more accurate gauge of the current jobs environment."

"If you're going to say by playing a different player on the bench is tanking, well that's a heck of an indictment on that player that you're saying that guy is not worthy of being in the NBA, because that's what you're saying," Frank said.

Shalom Auslander's first novel, "Hope: A Tragedy," is a brilliant mix of Borscht Belt humor and the caustic theory that "the greatest source of misery in the world, the greatest cause of anguish and hatred and sadness and death" is hope.

Has honor gone the way of fidelity and what we once called "morality," before morals became self-defining?

Question: In January, my husband and I flew to Rio de Janeiro from LAX, as we have done many times. But this time, something unusual happened. We had never had jet lag like this before, and we had it at both ends of the trip. If it had been just one of us, I might have thought one of us was coming down with something. The fact that it happened to both of us, both ways, same symptoms, makes me wonder whether they might be pressurizing the plane differently. Is it possible that caused our jet lag?
Irving is ambidextrous around the rim, but so was James. In the latter's case, having his choice of weapons was a big advantage, albeit one increasingly negated in the biggest games by his fear of failure. This was evident both in the end of the Boston series with the Cavs in 2010 and in the closing moments of the NBA Finals games vs. Dallas in 2011.

Daily deals. Half-price mani-pedis, massages, trapeze classes and anything else that might appeal to moms have become so common on daily deal sites that it's hard to justify paying full price for anything.

According to Wisconsin, this was the eighth time that one school has beaten the No. 1 team in football and basketball in the same season.

Penning the final answers. Sands are shifting in the Rockies' bullpen. Esmil Rogers and Josh Outman are staging late pushes to make the relief corps that has potentially three jobs open. Rogers has attracted trade interest and is out of options. He would be a seventh-inning guy. Outman could provide protection if Matt Reynolds struggles against left-handers. That means Josh Roenicke, who has pitched well, could slip onto the bubble, particularly if Edgmer Escalona finishes strong.

At another party, thrown by Maxim on Saturday, the cost to the invite-only fete (tickets went for thousands online) started to make more sense as Ludacris appeared, someone not on our list of expected guests that included people like Tom Colicchio and Vanilla Ice (a no-show, as far as we saw). On the red carpet, the rapper mostly gave us a "stay out my biz-nass" snub, but that was because he had to get to the stage.

It turns out that filming in an endless take, while keeping the camera either on the same person or on things seen from her perspective, doesn't suppress terror; it builds it. It does so in two ways. First, it increases a viewer's connection with the protagonist's helplessness. When the young woman (Elizabeth Olsen) hides inside a room hearing sounds outside the door, the audience hears and sees only what she hears and sees. There is no chance of knowing more.

Grilled asparagus needs no adornment to enjoy, but in honor of spring ham I am wrapping the room temperature grilled asparagus with translucent slices of Prosciutto for an antipasto appetizer all in one bite. You can take it even further and dress it up as a gorgeous salad with a dollop of buratta or fresh mozzarella and a drizzle of olive oil, coarse sea salt and cracked black pepper. Either way, it's the perfect way to celebrate spring!
In fact, whether we admit it or not, we citizen strivers need anger -- maybe especially political anger -- to keep all this momentum going. Satisfaction might lull us into passivity; dissatisfaction can move us to act. A quick check of most comment boards supports this: You hear mostly from the ticked off.
Some architects have responded to the decade's repeated disappointments in the political sphere by retreating into self-contained, occasionally hermetic debates over form and digital design. Many have come to accept what all of us are at least occasionally tempted to concede: that the idea of architects as influential political actors is always based on illusion, that power is something that uses architecture rather than the other way around.
What Rose missed Wednesday was a chance to pad his stats. The Bulls responded to their dismal loss to the Wizards with a thumping of the woeful Bobcats that began early. Hamilton scored 12 points without missing a shot, and Joakim Noah scored all 10 of his first-quarter points on layups or dunks.

In 1966, my future wife brought me home to meet her family. Ron was one of her younger brothers. He didn't have Down syndrome, but was severely challenged. In 1953, just after birth, his mind and body had been ravaged by convulsions due to a blood sugar problem. In a situation similar to that of George Will's son, advisors at the hospital suggested that the baby be left behind, to die or to be institutionalized.

Arizona could be particularly interesting because the Cardinals have some playmakers (including an All-Pro receiver), they play in a dome, and their division is winnable even with the resurgence of the 49ers. Miami is appealing in part because Dolphins owner Stephen Ross might step up in a big way to land a star, but that's a very tough division with each of the other three teams playing outdoors in cold-weather cities.

But there's also rock-and-roll in their bones. Howard cites Brown and Redding as singers who have shaped her, but also more surprising sources such as Bon Scott of AC/DC, big-band swinger Louis Prima, and "the young Conway Twitty, when he was a rock-and-roll singer, not a country singer." Her favorite songwriters, she says, are David Bowie, neo-hippie Devendra Banhart, and the guys in the Nashville baby band Fly Golden Eagle, of whom she is an ardent supporter.

Kudos to Mac Nachlas for expressing so eloquently most of the feedback I've been hearing regarding the Baltimore Grand Prix ("One racing weekend is no panacea for Baltimore," Sept. 8). Baltimore's reputation has been not been earned by television shows like "The Wire." That show is simply a reflection of the realities of Baltimore. The failure of the mayor and City Council and the Baltimore City Police to quash the city's reputation as a drug and slum infested metropolis will not be replaced by an annual auto race. The barriers come down, the race cars are hauled away, and all Baltimore has to show for it in the long run are several smoother streets.

Diehl and the Giants will have to contend with the Saints’ heavy blitz schemes. One way to neutralize them is to finally get the running game going. Ahmad Bradshaw seems likely to be out of action for the fourth straight game, but the Saints’ run defense (a league-worst 5.2 yards per carry allowed) should provide some opportunities for Jacobs, D.J. Ware and Da’Rel Scott.

The towns own their beaches and run them as separate entities with separate budgets. Those so-called utilities use revenue from beach fees to cover expenses such as rescue equipment and maintenance and salaries for lifeguards.

TICKETS. Most festivals of any size these days have websites where you can buy tickets online, and you can usually buy by mail or phone through the festival's box office. To keep costs down, check for reduced-price pre-season "preview" prices, senior discounts, late-season reductions, last-minute specials, and such. Also, consider "cheap seats" that might be pretty good. At the Santa Fe Opera, for example, a seat in the front row loge costs $155 but you can get a seat six rows behind for $37. Performance SRO? At some festivals, ticketholders unable to attend a current or future performance may hang around the box office selling tickets at list or even cut prices -- I see that most days at my hometown's blockbuster Shakespeare festival. You might also find "can't use" tickets on Craigslist; I see some opera tickets available on the Santa Fe Craigslist. Surprisingly, I find that the big national ticket sellers such as StubHub, Ticketmaster and Webtickets don't have much to do with summer festivals.

Helping give this story its essential air of reality is the decision Demme and cinematographer Quinn made to shoot it as what they call "the most beautiful home movie ever made." The director chose not to plan shots in advance, instead giving Quinn (whose credits include Mira Nair's "Monsoon Wedding") the ability to respond in the moment to what was going on with the actors, and it's a tribute to his ability (and that of editor Tim Squyres) that his camera always seems to be in the right place at the right time.

Another new character is the spidery mythical figure Arachne (T.V. Carpio). Pulled from the depths of Greek mythology, her role is confusing.

Such widespread attention to a show on a niche channel not available on basic cable is, in part, a tribute to its timeliness.

Fifteen percent of our commuters need to adjust the way they get to work and we would see a marked improvement on our roadways.

Part of the "Sea Lions" show aims at whale trainers, one of whom humorously frolics along outside the pool while a walrus goes through the same motions a whale does in a "One Ocean" segment.

It's also a complex film. That's not unheard of in an animated movie, particularly one from Pixar, the studio that numbers the "Toy Story" films, "WALL-E" and "Finding Nemo" among its credits.

For example, explore the sequence of dreams in Matthew chapters 1-3. Remember how Joseph has been scandalized by the news that Mary has become pregnant. Her pregnancy brings shame to his family's good name. Yet it appears that Joseph harbors no ill feelings toward Mary. Instead, righteously and quietly, Joseph searches for answers. His life has become ringed by terror and scandal, and the options seem impossible, even hopeless. There is no grace, just fear and anxiety.

Rail ranting. The Tampa Tribune's editorial board had a few pretty good lines in response to critics who suggested that, if passenger rail were such a good idea, private companies would build it. Wrote the Trib: "Yacht owners didn't build the Intracoastal Waterway. Ship owners didn't build the Port of Tampa. Airlines and airplane owners didn't build Tampa International Airport." Touché. Personally, I have concerns about the success of rail as well. But whenever people start griping about it being a "money-loser," I wonder if these folks have ever managed to find a profit statement for Interstate 4.

I can't score a movie, but I can make up my own songs that seem to resonate with enough people so that I can do this for a living."

For me it was a reminder about how privileged my generation of Americans had been. Those of us who grew up in Hawaii were never allowed to forget the attack on Pearl Harbor, but most mainland kids I knew thought of World War II as ancient history. I also remembered a trip I took to Northern Ireland in 1990, and how disturbed I had been to see soldiers with machine guns on otherwise "normal" street corners. I had actually told someone back then that I could never raise children in an environment like that. After September 11, I realized how presumptuous that statement had been, how naive I was to assume I would always have the choice to live somewhere free of violence and suspicion.

Mr. Romney had better spell out clear positions on that, and on our national security.

There are steps women can take to make a bold signature lipstick work, says Sarah Lucero, a makeup artist for Stila Cosmetics, who gave models wine-colored lips during New York Fashion Week.

A: I have a passion for local food, for local farmers, for local small business, a real heart and real affinity for supporting these folks. The small family farmer has been lost in the last 40 or 50 years. The other thing is that people have lost touch with the seasons of food in their local area. People don't know, for instance, that a tomato grows in Missouri in July. We're so blessed to get so much food, like oranges, from all over the world, but we lose touch with what's grown here. My passion is to educate the community about local seasonal food and about the small family farmer, so people can meet the farmer who grows their food. We call them food producers because in addition to the fruit and vegetable growers, we also have people who produce bees and honey, people who bring wool, people who have chickens and bring eggs, pork, beef, lamb and so on.

The atmosphere was vintage Kentucky. Moments after the Wildcats put the finishing touches on its 76-69 victory against fellow blue blood North Carolina to advance to the Final Four, it was as if nothing had ever changed.

Michelle and I were saddened to hear about the passing of Congressman Donald Payne, Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and former Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. By any standard, Don lived a full and meaningful life. After serving as the first African American President of the National Council of YMCAs, and then several years in local government, Don went on to become the first African American Congressman to represent the state of New Jersey.
