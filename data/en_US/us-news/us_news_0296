Although it took nine years, the couple engaged Mike Hughes of Kirkwood, owner of Crem Inc., design and building, to create Jerry's library. By then, Jerry had amassed so many books they were stacked 5 feet high in his office. Mike had redone the basement, family room and entryway of the 3,800-square foot home.

It was out of sheer curiosity that I planned a trip to the American Southwest last summer. I would be going into my junior year of high school, and I was simply up for an adventure with different geography and culture.

So there is a lot going on in this long, long novel, which, paradoxically, reads as smoothly as a fast-paced daily newspaper story. The action scenes alone come across beautifully, as visual as anything on a movie screen, with the added enticement of crisp, accurate and hard-driving prose. As in the following scene in the Four Seasons in Paris: "Ding Chavez got slightly ahead of Dominic as they sprinted up the fourth-floor hallway. Both men doffed their rain parkas and let them fall as they ran on, got their hands on their sub-guns, and unslung the ropes from their necks. When he arrived at the door to room 401, Chavez just shouldered right through it, smashing the bolt out of the doorjamb and sending the door flying in. He fell to the ground and Caruso leapt over him with his HK trained toward movement on the bed."

Our introduction to Nobbs comes on a typically busy day at Morrison's Hotel, with the opening sequence giving us a measure of the strictures within which Nobbs operates — some self-imposed, others tied to the conventions of the times, and yet more determined by the hotel's owner, Mrs. Baker (Pauline Collins).

With the U.S. economy improving, it's past time for the administration to lay out a credible plan for bringing the deficit and debt under control. Sadly, Obama's budget proposal shows that he'd rather wait until after the election to have that reckoning.

The differential between old world and new world chardonnay has not been lost on California vintners. We are currently witnessing a dramatic swing in the taste pendulum, from big, buttery, powerful chardonnays to more nuanced, complex and food-friendly wines.

The American people know what the right choice is. They know that our generation's success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to their country's future. We know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility. That's an America built to last.

The five Buckeyes suspended for five games, along with linebacker Jordan Whiting, who is suspended for one game, have been proven to have a relationship with former tattoo parlor owner Ed Rife. That association with the OSU program is not in doubt, nor is the fact that Tressel committed NCAA violations by concealing knowledge of his players' memorabilia sales, and that eventually led to the coach's resignation Monday.
In December, Lee authorized a raid on a large encampment of protesters who had set up tents at Justin Herman Plaza at the foot of Market Street, citing a city law banning camping in tents in public spaces and a determination by the city that the site was a public health hazard.

Torvund's "Neon Forest Space," for instance, included bursts of radio static that were as carefully tuned and timed as any violin writing, and included interplay between the cello and amplified percussion that was rhythmically ingenious as well as sonically surprising. And if the idea of "extended techniques" threatened to bring up some of the drearier aspects of the mid-20th century avant-garde, the wit and high spirits on display quickly put that specter to rest.

"I think I played good, except for that one hole where I hit it in the water," Somin Lee said. "Hopefully I will get it back together (today) and win it. I guess I had a little bit more pressure.

The air shimmers clear blue and the climate is mild nearly year round. Ornate pink canterra spires on the Gothic Parroquía de San Miguel Arcangel dominate a cityscape of ochre, rose and gold colonial mansions and houses lining narrow cobblestone streets. The pace is so slow bent-over ladies in blue housedresses stay in step with fashionistas in Madonna-worthy boots. Drivers are so courteous there's no need for semaforos (traffic lights). No wonder more than 10,000 foreigners have taken up residence here. Wealthy Mexicans and expats have hired famed architects to create nouveau haciendas in hills above the city, and companies like Rosewood have opened handsome hotels and residential enclaves.

The law, Jumpstart Our Business Startups, eases the requirements that small companies must meet to raise money. One of the most intriguing parts of the law for many businesses is crowdfunding. The new rules make it legal for companies to solicit money from millions of investors without having to go through the lengthy process of filing registration documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The law dramatically streamlines the paperwork that companies must complete. Obama signed the bill into law last week.

Both halves of the film open with maps that provide mini-lessons in geopolitics, but from there their aesthetic approaches differ (the second section being less visually stylized). Working as cinematographer under his nom-de-camera, Peter Andrews, Soderbergh has shot Part One in widescreen, with an emphasis on meticulously composed tableaux and medium shots. This is not Che in close-up, but Che in interaction. Often he's not even the central element in the frame; when he disciplines a young rebel soldier, Che's face is off-screen.
The liberal historian Richard Hofstadter popularized the label in a book he wrote in the 1940s. He applied it to supporters of the free market in the 19th century who never applied it to themselves. As Princeton professor Thomas Leonard points out, American businessmen in the Gilded Age rarely leaned on Darwin: "Their defenses of laissez faire much more commonly invoked religion, the common good, Horatio Alger mythology, the American republican tradition." Even the two alleged theorists of social Darwinism, Herbert Spencer and William Graham Sumner, were complex figures and awkward fits for the term. Hofstadter used social Darwinist, Leonard writes, "in the traditional way: as an epithet to discredit views he opposed."

--LF Delmon Young is eligible to come off the suspended list Friday and faces an uncertain reception once manager Jim Leyland decides to put him in the starting lineup again. Leyland proclaimed Young won't start Friday but that he could be inserted at some point if the situation warrants. He was suspended for seven games after being arrested and charged with misdemeanor aggravated assault in New York last Friday. Young might be kept out of left field and used as the designated hitter if public reaction is negative, and being in the outfield would subject him to taunts from fans.

The Oregon Shakespeare Festival announced on Friday that it expects income to fall short of budget by about $750,000 for the 2008 season.

IMPAIRED DRIVING/RESISTING ARREST, SOLON AND RICHMOND ROADS: A Solon man, 41, was arrested following a two-vehicle accident around 10:30 p.m. on April 24, where multiple departments responded because of the location. The man initially claimed to have been a passenger in the car, but the owner, a Solon woman, 33, faces a wrongful entrustment charge for letting him drive the car when he appeared to be intoxicated. Both were charged with obstructing official business as well, as they kept interfering with police efforts to conduct interviews at the scene. The driver of the other car, a Sagamore Hills woman, was taken to Bedford Hospital for treatment after the suspect, whose driver’s license was already suspended, ran a red light. After being warned about getting in the way, the suspect at one point wanted to take on three officers, which is when he was taken to the ground, where police found a small knife as well as the car keys. He also faces charges of carrying a concealed weapon and driving under suspension, and refusing a breath test.
