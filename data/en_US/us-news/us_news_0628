Shanghai suffered a similar fate to that now potentially facing Chongqing in 2006 when city party secretary Chen Liangyu was dismissed from his post as part of an investigation into the misuse of Shanghai's pension fund. Like Mr. Bo, Mr. Chen was also a Politburo member, and had presided over a massive construction boom that fueled Shanghai's runaway economic growth. Dozens of officials fell alongside Mr. Chen, and the turmoil ushered in a period of extreme caution among survivors, making it difficult for investors and businesses to get the licenses and approvals to operate in the city and killing off dozens of projects.

The problem, according to Edward Cinelli, the director of the organization that oversees high school athletics in Suffolk County, is that state education law won't allow it.

I can't imagine a more important gift to our kids than making sure we are never a financial burden on them.

To which I say: You are right, but only a little. Of course Alito is not about to be appointed to deflect "Brokeback's" message per se, but rather, he is being installed in general reaction to, in attack on, in preparation for, what Brokeback" and its ilk represent. Which is, of course, the aforementioned awakening, the shift, the movement toward something new and different and open. This is the ever-present push-pull of the culture. This is how we stumble toward the light, gasping and bleeding and with painful rope burns on our wrists. After all, there is no progress -- intellectual, spiritual, sexual or otherwise -- without a concomitant blood-curdling scream from the power brokers and the religiously terrified to hold it all back.

Without the carnal pleasure of braised pork knuckle (a.k.a. pork pump), a Shanghai restaurant would absolutely be dismissed.

National Energy Laboratory of Hawaii: What started as a futuristic experiment in generating electricity is now generating something completely different — abalone and lobster. The NELHA facility, which is near the Kona airport, still houses a plant for making electricity, but there's some serious aquaculture going on too.

Last year, results of a large study found no clear link between cell phones and cancer.

But in 2005, the Ohio legislature corrected that by passing a law that allowed prosecutors to seek a penalty of life without the possibility of parole rather than a death sentence. Since that law passed, we have seen the number of death sentences drop precipitously.

The details: Nothing stokes the fires of gratitude like an oversize bottle of wine.

Some 55% of the children diagnosed with a brain tumor reported they had been regular users of a mobile phone before diagnosis. A slightly smaller 51% of the healthy children in the comparison group said they talked regularly on a cellphone. After grouping the children according to the intensity of the cellphone use, the researchers found no relationship between how often a child used a cellphone and the likelihood of his or her developing brain cancer. And brain tumors were no more likely to occur on the side that a child preferred to hold a cellphone to his head (where a cellphone's heat, at least, might penetrate into brain tissue) than they were on the opposite side.

Incompatible sex drives, initially masked by the lusty bath of neurochemicals, might suddenly reveal themselves.

The bad news is that "In the Wake" shares Ellen's good and not-so-good traits, including the rambling -- the show lasts nearly three hours. Director Leigh Silverman and the primo cast (especially Deirdre O'Connell as a wry misanthropic aid worker) help make the evening a pain-free one, but Kron just tries to cover too many bases.

The five-minute deadline for rescuers is important for a couple of reasons. First, it's the standard from the National Fire Protection Assn., which sets nationwide consensus guidelines for fire departments and says they should beat that time on 90% of calls. More important, it's a key lifesaving time frame, because if people in cardiac arrest suffer oxygen deprivation for between four and six minutes, permanent brain damage can occur. Longer response times are likely to result in more deaths.

Other "bubble states" haven't done nearly as well, though they've seen similar drops in housing prices. Domestic migration to Arizona, which had peaked at more than 130,000 in 2005 and 2006, fell to 15,000 in 2009 and remained low, at 13,000, in 2011. But at least Arizona's economy shows signs of improving. Not so Nevada's. Nevada gained more than 40,000 domestic migrants in every year from 2001 through 2007. As in Florida and Arizona, housing prices rose inordinately, reaching nearly double the 3.0 median multiple in Las Vegas. But even after the housing bubble burst and the cost of living fell, with the median multiple now well below 3.0, Nevada lost a net 11,000 domestic migrants in 2011.

The 2011-12 Bucks didn't really fit Skiles' typical hardnosed, defense-first approach to the game. They averaged 99 points per game this season, fifth-most in the league. An impressive passing team when they were at their best, the Bucks averaged 23.5 assists per game - third-best in the league.
American movies were in short supply, partly thanks to production delays caused by labor strife in Hollywood, but also to the vagaries of distribution. "American Violet," directed by Tim Disney from Bill Haney's script, is marked by the eloquent debut of Nicole Behaire as a young single mother named Dee Roberts. She's the heroine of a drama based on a landmark case in which a similarly young and poor Texas woman brought suit against a local district attorney for a pattern of racism after many black residents of her small town were arrested in a single night. In "Flash of Genius," Greg Kinnear brings a quirky intensity to the role of Robert Kearns, the inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper who won judgments against Ford and Chrysler for appropriating his idea. And in "Adam Resurrected," Paul Schrader's fearless film version of Yoram Kaniuk's Holocaust novel, Jeff Goldblum is nothing short of dazzling as a former circus clown being treated in an Israeli mental institution.

Terminal Tower. When I was a child, my father would take us to the tower the day after the school year was finished, and we would board the B&O headed to Washington, D.C., where we would spend the night with my aunt.

Not so at Wrigley. Jump online the day before, eight tickets in section 219 - back under the upper deck, but with a great view of the field - for $33 apiece, plus change. I hate to be one of those columnists who discover regular life and starts gibbering in amazement. But I was taken aback by how cheaply you can get into Wrigley, thanks to dynamic ticket pricing. You can get seats for as low as $8, to see scrub "bronze" level teams like the Brewers or the Astros - the same ticket would cost you $29 to see the Red Sox or Cardinals.

In the black-and-white realm of negative ads, it is not enough to highlight a policy disagreement; you also want to make your target look like a felon.

Shellfish entrees are better, notably day boat scallops that let all their sweetness come through -- although supporting it with chorizo and butter provides an odd base for such a delicate crustacean.

Like just about every other woman I know, I've had body-image issues for as long as I can remember. It's hard to grow up female in this culture and not have a pretty twisted relationship to food, the scale, and your own body. But I'm trying. The way I see it, the healthier I am inside and out, at least as much as it's in my power to be, the better I am able to fulfill my duties as a priest. Not to mention my responsibilities to my two daughters, who are also looking to me as a role model and guide.

Believe it or not, this has given me pause. What? A journalist with a conscience? (This was the semi-serious reaction I got from Judge Franz Miller last week as we commiserated on public-access issues in the Internet Age. Yes, Your Honor, there's also this moralist I've heard about at the Cleveland paper, and a thoughtful guy at a rag in the Tampa-St. Pete area, although he might have died. But, yeah, so far as this profession goes, we're about it.)
AQAP possesses the right combination of operational expertise, communication with its supporters, ideological influence and transnational reach to elevate it to this position.

Washington’s army hiked in over two feet of snow to their winter encampment in Jockey Hollow. Last year, even more snow than that fell across the Highlands! Today, you can hike along the same routes (free of snow) and relive the past, in relative comfort. Perhaps you’d rather explore the area on horseback; if so, give Seaton Hackney Stables a call. If bicycling is more your speed, be sure to stop by Marty’s Reliable Cycle for some tips.

Mary Corse has been making versions of the same painting since the 1960s: large canvases, divided into discrete geometric units, with a pale, shimmery surface. The examples on view at Ace Gallery, all created last year, are no exception. Still, it's a bit unfair to say that they are uniformly silvery white. Corse's paintings are not uniformly anything; they shift continuously in infinitesimal gradations as the viewer moves about the room. This is due to the glass microspheres the artist embeds in her paint, which capture the light in different ways depending on the angle of viewing. Sometimes they look like brushed aluminum, sometimes like watered silk. Perfect, vertical stripes of varying widths appear and disappear in almost cinematic washes of white and gray.

Ruess, 30, a Robby Benson lookalike, leads the sound with a versatile voice, easily rattling off narrative lyrics or feisty lines and - for someone who somehow has earned more than one comparison to Tracy Chapman - occasionally punching strings of high notes worthy of Jon Anderson (Yes). He mostly employs that to propel words of youthful existential awakening and uplifting discovery - "If you could see me / whoever I am" ("Walking the Dog"), "Live until we die ... never take a day for granted" ("The Gambler"), "I feel alive!" ("Barlights") - as well as some ruminations that now seem ironic given the band's massive success - "I'm over 25 / and I can't make a name for myself" ("One Foot"). Two songs mention Saturday night, which earned whoops and cheers on Saturday night.
These were not hacks, either – not with brand names like Brahms, Reger, Webern and the anonymous fellow who penned the sensitive treatment of “An Silvia.” By and large, even though the orchestrated lieder still breathe Schubert through and through, you could sense the personalities of their orchestrators – Brahms’ distinctive horn and wind voicings in “Memnon,” Webern’s early Romantic style with just a touch of his pointillistic future, Reger’s thicker textures.

Vanderbeek said last week that he regrets coming to Newark, that he should have listened to the cynics who told him to stay away.

The little boy's mom and I were super close. We had to make the choice to either just do things occasionally with each other without the boys or split our friendship. Of course in the beginning, we tried to get them back together, but it just didn't work.
