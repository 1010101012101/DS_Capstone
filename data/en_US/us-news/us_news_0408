The recent success in New York regarding marriage equality is at once exhilarating and disheartening.
But by the end of "Sailor," no character has escaped his or her own reckoning. One of the most compelling drivers of this novel is that all the characters, with all their failures and foibles, have to wade through the consequences of their past. For some, the wages of sin are death; for others, it's a deeply different form of life. By the end, the solution to the deeply twisted calculus of the plot is surprising, sad and wholly satisfactory.

Everyone knows you don't get something for nothing, or -- in a lease -- $2.4 billion for nothing. Whatever your opinion, a lease will be a long-term agreement lasting 50 to 75 years, through several generations of Ohioans, who will pay much higher tolls for any large upfront payment. Our elected officials need to understand the long-term consequences of such an arrangement, and they need to give this concept serious debate and careful consideration.

Sauvignon Blanc originates in the Bordeaux region of France. The name comes from the French words 'sauvage" (wild) and "blanc" (white), due to its origins as an indigenous grape in the Loire Valley and Bordeaux. Today, the grape is grown in many parts of the world. Wines made from Sauvignon Blanc can differ so greatly in taste and style that they have inspired a wide range of colorful descriptions, including "cat pee," which oddly enough is considered a good thing, as well as herbaceous, grassy, minerally, citrusy and tropical.

And, let's face it, we're weary of the big problems. Just as one can sustain outrage (or any emotion) only so long, one can entertain the prospects of a melting planet, massive unemployment or dysfunctional government for just so many months.

For a time, it was believed that the Anasazi had abandoned the area. Archaeologists speculated, and argued, about why. Drought, some said. Environmental disasters and social unrest, others said.

Navajos were one possible enemy, and some said the word "Anasazi" was Navajo for "enemy ancestor." Today, some Pueblo people object to that term.

Four years after the onset of the financial crisis -- in March 2008 Bear Stearns was rescued from failure -- we still lack a clear understanding of the underlying causes. Hundreds of studies and books have given us an increasingly detailed picture of what happened without conclusively answering why.

But the best sign of all may have been the ebullient way the Iranians spun the negotiations back home in Tehran. Jalili and other officials portrayed the talks as a victory for Iranian steadfastness, and repeatedly noted Khamanei's fatwa outlawing nuclear weapons as a sin.

That's why it's important to include them when judging the available alternatives for a particular service.

As I sat there absorbing the news, I kept thinking, "How could this happen?" I've spent my career in healthcare; I'd like to think I know how to navigate the system.

Josh Hutcherson, who occasionally veered into blandness as Peeta in "The Hunger Games," is consistently bland as the skateboarding Clapton Davis, who for some reason thinks it's clever to say, "Clapton don't dance" whenever he's asked to dance.
Michigan won 15 of the first 28 league titles from 1896 through 1933, though the school withdrew from the league in 1907. The conference has been known as the Big Ten since Michigan's return in 1917.

Barbara Lieberman, who retired from the SLSO, played the opening phrases of "The Rose" on the piano which Hayman then picked up on the harmonica in a lovely arrangement that he dedicated to his wife of 50 years. For her final performance as principal trumpet of the SLSO, Susan Slaughter did terrific solo turns on "The Brave Bulls" and the Harry James standard "You Made Me Love You."

"No bounty program can exist without active player participation," Goodell said in a statement. "The evidence clearly showed that the players being held accountable today willingly and enthusiastically embraced the bounty program.

In a sense, such programs don't change opinions on a given social issue so much as reflect the ways in which American opinions have already changed. In the 1970s, the time was ripe for a character like Archie Bunker. America was ready to acknowledge and laugh at the ignorance that lived on in his resentful heart. Such a character wouldn't have been possible a generation earlier, when the struggle for civil rights was still very much a matter of life and death.
I know -- we experienced them. One day during our stay, the temperature gauge in the car read minus 23 degrees during our morning haul to the mountain. Lucky for us, it warmed up to a relatively balmy minus 17 by the time we got to the mountain.
It is unlikely, say both Kopman and Lemkemeier, that they could grow Schlafly's geographic footprint without more capacity. Even without spreading its wings to new markets, Schlafly could run out of beer if sales continue to grow at double-digit rates each year. That could enable other craft brewers - both larger and smaller - to gobble up some of the market share for craft beer that Schlafly helped create in this light lager town.

How awesome did the Rangers think it was, despite the fact that they said all the right things -- "he shouldn't have done it", etc. -- when they were in the privacy of their own locker room? What did the officials think of it? What was said on the ice? These are all questions with potentially awesome answers, and hopefully we'll see a few of those answers on HBO Wednesday night.

It might have made for a boring game, but it helped the team in many ways. It gave seldom-used players an actual chance to play during something other than garbage time. It provided all the evidence one needs that Bryant's above trying to just pick up individual accolades. And more importantly, he rested. Lastly, it was a really nice gesture that Bryant and Pau Gasol attended the game and sat on the bench, providing some minor instruction and having a good time. If they had preferred, I'm sure they could've stayed in Los Angeles.

Gray is a versatile athlete, having lined up as a slot receiver in some video I've seen from early in his career, and he took some snaps at quarterback (he was a quarterback at DeSoto High School in Texas at times). Add the fact he set a school record for kick-return yards in his freshman season, including a 98-yard touchdown return against Oklahoma, and he has a varied résumé.

ø2. The Kings have been lying in the weeds all seasons. This isn't a true No. 8 seed. True, they barely made the playoffs. But they were considered a team on the rise coming into the season. Although they struggled to score for most of the season, they were scoring enough late in the season. The Jeff Carter trade helped them.

Before I go on about how funny he is here, let me reiterate that what surrounds him is rudimentary. That's a shame, since so little is done with so much talent. Kevin Kline, a great and debonair comic actor in his own right, plays Inspector Dreyfus, Clouseau's rival, but the role is small in comparison to those played by Herbert Lom in the earlier Clouseau farces. Ditto for Emily Mortimer as Dreyfus's secretary, Nicole, and Jean Reno as Clouseau's partner, Ponton. Beyoncé Knowles, who plays a beautiful pop star named Xania, gets star treatment without star substance in the script -- it's as if the director, Shawn Levy, and the writers, Len Blum and Mr. Martin, had been concerned only with Clouseau. (There is a plot, by the way. It turns on murder and the theft of the Pink Panther diamond, with Xania as a prime suspect.)
When Texas was No. 1 in January, most people had Damion James as a legit contender to John Wall as national player of the year. Wall proves how far off that comparison was. Kentucky, 86-72.

Measuring about 4 feet by 8 feet, and looking like a futuristic escape pod with a door, the flotation tank at the wellness center is filled with about 10 inches of water and about 800 to 1,000 pounds of Epsom salts.

A similar effort to legalize gay marriage in Maryland failed last year after it died in the House of Delegates without coming to a vote. In July 2011, O’Malley, a Democrat, announced he would include a gay marriage law in his legislative package that would allow religious organizations to refuse to conduct same-sex weddings.
Shut out, too, were black actors. True, it was a year that lacked a breakthrough hit like “Precious,” but none of the actresses in “For Colored Girls” was remembered; despite a personal push by Halle Berry, her multiple-personality melodrama — yet to open wide — “Frankie and Alice,” was ignored. It will be the first Oscars in a decade without a single African-American honoree.
After all, the Obama administration's rescue of General Motors allowed the company to keep running the giant foundry here, a mainstay of the local economy. If the recession drove joblessness here beyond 13 percent, the lengthy extensions of unemployment benefits in the stimulus package enabled struggling residents to keep their homes and keep patronizing local businesses.
The boys know them all.
Even if President Obama's wildly optimistic projection that HIT could save $80 billion a year were true, the savings would amount to just 3 percent of the $2.6 trillion that America spends on health care each year. That's nothing to sneeze at - but it won't come close to solving our nation's health-cost crisis.

We stop at the Soviet-style main plaza, Sukhbaatar Square, named after the first communist era leader. Like his hero, Lenin, Sukhbaatar was scrubbed, drained and pumped full of chemicals after death. His tomb, largely unvisited since the communists were removed from power in 1990, sits at the top of the square.

Until recently, my schooling on all things Bratislavan occurred during a 20-minute stop on a train traveling from Prague, Czech Republic, to Budapest, Hungary, almost a decade ago.

And the plant descriptions aren't written in a dispassionate, disembodied voice. Of Ruby Giant, Gardens Navigator confesses that the plant is not really ruby (it's purple) and it's not really giant (because, well, it's a crocus). But it also tells you hardiness zone (3) sun requirements (full or partial) foliage color, height, just about all a gardener could want to know.

About two-thirds of the economists in the NABE survey think that banks should not be allowed to trade with their own money to bet on financial markets. The new rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, was included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act in an effort to restrict risky trading by banks. Such trading was a source of large profits for the banks prior to the financial crisis. Critics like Volcker have said that kind of trading could lead to spectacular losses that jeopardize the nation's financial system.

growth in five years. Consumer confidence rose to its highest point in a year this month, the Conference Board reported Tuesday. That could signal Americans are ready to step up spending, which would fuel more growth. Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.
I fell into that category only dragged in by office peer pressure, which deemed it inconceivable that I could not be part of 18 participants. What if they won and I was not part of it? The thought of working next to an office full of financially secure people was not appetizing. But it was also comforting to know that if I won, I could share the spotlight with 17 other equally deserving people. Chastened by news of a recent lawsuit, we were careful to create a pdf document of all purchased tickets and made them available to all players. Having an electronic file of the 90 tickets enabled me to do a quick search for the mega millions number 23. Only four tickets had the bonus number and within two minutes I realized it would be business as usual. No difficult decisions would have to be made. No lawyers or financial planners would be needed.

AIRLINES: If you have an airline ticket to/from an area of potential impact, airlines generally allow you to reschedule your trip with no change penalty, no fees, and no change in fare, but with strict limits: You can change flights originally booked for specific routes and dates -- usually just two or three days -- and your replacement trip must generally start within a week or so of your original dates. If you'd rather wait beyond the airline's narrow deadlines or make other changes, you'll face some combination of exchange fees and possible fare increases. When an airline actually cancels your flight, you can get a full refund on even a nonrefundable ticket. Although airlines proactively cancel lots of flights a few days in advance, you usually won't know far enough ahead to do much planning.
Roos and two groups he founded sued, arguing that the sign was a political statement protected by the Constitution.
Much of his engineering knowledge is from hands-on experience, first with major motorcycle companies and then, in the early 1990s, the bike division of Easton. When Easton decided to sponsor triathlete Paula Newby-Fraser, Felt designed and built her bike in his off time. Newby-Fraser won the Ironman in Hawaii, and Felt's reputation for designing speedy bikes took off.
Things were fine until Rick Olivieri became president of the Reading Terminal Market merchants group in the early '90s.

These monsters are, essentially, freestanding closets and are sometimes referred to as "wardrobes." What better place to stash your clothes? The one shown above is among the most common layouts, with a cupboard-like section up top that typically features a hang bar and a drawer or two below. I've got one with sliding doors on both sides and shelving above the hang bar, so there are definitely variations on the theme.

The school's student council raised the money to buy the items through bake sales, spirit days and candy sales.

But, yes, McGinn has suffered from back problems before. He had surgery for it in 2008, in fact. I don't know the full extent of his problems, but back issues are no fun -- I know, I've had them. He had a pretty full playing schedule this year, so they couldn't have been overly serious.

The complexity lies in the fact that Presbyterians and other denominations for years have declared support for the nation of Israel yet again are flirting with a policy that can easily be read by both Israelis and Palestinians as implied support for the dissolution of Israel. For example, the "right of return" of Palestinians, an explicit demand in the "Bethlehem Call," a Palestinian Christian document, would mean in a relatively short time that Palestinians would outnumber Jews in Israel and could outvote them.

Mr. Santorum is a decent man in an indecent age, preaching to a largely hedonistic culture about old-time values abandoned by many, perhaps even a majority, of Americans.

Readers a generation or two younger than I may find my story as quaint as Fortune's wheel — despite ever-new homo jokes, insults, suicides. We're told many young people regard sexual orientation like handedness — you're born lefty or righty, straight or gay; big deal. If so, I suspect these young folks are beneficiaries, as I myself have been, of men and women in earlier years and now — as individuals and members of organizations, and maybe their numbers were greater than I suggested above — who have struggled for an end to the prejudice and hatred that have doomed many in the closet. That struggle necessarily continues, and this column is my little hammer tinkle in support.

ø"We've certainly brought our share of good recruiting classes over the years," he said. "Signing the three of them is a huge accomplishment. They are unique. We've had a lot of great guards, but I don't know that they've been like Moriah Jefferson. We've had a lot of great wing players, most recently Maya Moore, but none exactly like Morgan Tuck. We've also had a lot of 6-3, 6-4 kids come through here, but none of them are like Breanna Stewart."

My fear is that the wounding of Komen, which has been breast cancer's sacred cow, will turn women and men against the cause. I hope that doesn't happen.

A track in Kentucky had changed to synthetic materials and dramatically cut deaths during races.

Also, Kelly was asked about his running backs, where Kenjon Barner assumes the role capably filled the past three seasons by LaMichael James.

Gotzon, talking a mile a minute and making Louis' job as a word processor into a living pun, is rumpled and touching, a striking counterpoint to the character's ruthless decisions. As his sick lover, Watts shows us a man alternately petulant, terrified and flirtatious, holding onto his charm for all he's worth. Peirick uses his imposing size as a bulwark against intimacy, while tiny Hanks plays Joe's wife with a wide-eyed gaze that no longer suggests innocence so much as derangement.
It is hardly surprising that Romney's image has suffered during the bruising Republican primary.

And the more people who do it, the more socially acceptable and desirable it becomes. The decline in the ownership rate means that about three million more households rent today than did at the height of the bubble.

I find your Watchgog article regarding Ron Saathoff and his taking another position to be hypocritical. The article insinuates he is being greedy and opportunistic for accepting another job and pension, something all of us strive to do to provide better opportunities for ourselves and our families. In applying your logic, it would then seem your current owner and publisher, an established real estate developer, should also be criticized as being greedy and opportunistic in his purchase of the U-T for what appears to be for personal and financial gain. It's no surprise or coincidence when the U-T proposed the redevelopment of the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal into a sports complex. It would also be no surprise to see your publisher as the developer. It appears the U-T supports the double standard that public employees career options should be limited without the same limitations in the private sector. I worry more about individuals who are capable of using their personal fortune for political and public influence than someone who simply wants to earn an additional paycheck or pension to better their lives. I'm more concerned about what Big Business is doing and how they are doing it and hope The Watchdog is as well.
These monsters also affect adults, who, as a result, have less energy, lower capacities to work and learn, occasional bouts of incapacitation and a miserable existence. The illnesses reduce incomes dramatically; they also negatively affect the life chances of their children. An example, perhaps extreme, is lymphatic filariasis, an infection whose most extreme form is elephantiasis. In this form, it can cause permanent deformities so extreme that the stigma attached to the deformities results in physical isolation similar to that faced by lepers in medieval Europe.
