A day ahead of the crucial Michigan primary, Romney shifted his line of attack from the cultural issues and conservative rhetoric he used over the weekend and instead insisted that the former Pennsylvania senator doesnt know how to create jobs.
A. I don't think the film is a polemic on the war. The setting, the conflict in the Middle East, in general, is what Hitchcock would call, "the McGuffin." It's the reason we're there.

It may be a better fictional reckoning of Hurricane Katrina than any other, and do a better job of coming to grips with that disaster than we have yet seen for 9/11. It was that resonance, along with a singular writing style, that made it the National Book Award selection.

A German-French-British production, "The Three Musketeers" doesn't worry much about dialogue or accents.

Regular readers know I despise this sort of vile sexualization of girls. It's deplorable that their parents allowed their daughters to exploit their prepubescent bodies this way. But, what I want to know, what kind of justification process do all the adults involved in this production go through?

Van der Leeuw, a Dutch industrialist so taken with Neutra's 1929 Lovell House that he immediately wrote a check just to see what the architect would build for himself). After a disastrous fire destroyed the structure in 1963, the Austrian-born architect conceived VDL II in collaboration with his son Dion. What rose from the ashes is a more interesting building than the one that was lost, from the colossal metal louvers on the entrance facade to the hanging gardens of the interior courtyard.

That's the Apple that spit Mr. Jobs out. The second Apple—the Apple of the iPod, iPhone and iPad—was the noncomputer company that Mr. Jobs perhaps instinctively intended all along.

Hudson sang an abbreviated version of “I Will Always Love You” – Houston’s signature number, and an opportunity to belt. The capable Jennifer Hudson soared to the high notes, and did seem to be choking back tears as she hit them. But she didn’t show off, and she didn’t grandstand. Her version was a mournful, tasteful one. Under a solitary blue spotlight, Hudson’s version could even be described as ghostly.

The market, built in 1933, looks like a giant Art Deco barn topped by a clock tower. Stalls under the eastern eaves sell photogenic produce from beans to berries, while inside are equally camera-worthy terrines and pâtés, organic butcher shops and a sumptuous outpost of the Première Moisson patisserie.

A. The book was designed to imitate what a movie camera can do. It was very consciously thinking about movies and editing and zooming in and zooming out and panning and all of these camera movements.

We talked about the Right Brain Initiative, we talked about funding. Let's talk about schools generally. One of the major proposals that our campaign is making -- and we're trying to be disciplined and not to have scattershot proposals -- one of the major initiatives we are trying to push forward is Portland Summers. More and more information is showing that the biggest driver of the achievement gap is the summer camp. A perfect marriage is between the arts community, the creative community and current and amplified summer programs, through schools, parks, nonprofits that we already have, because it'll make it more fun. The mayor also needs to be an advocate for schools in funding generally.

A whole brain education including arts education is critical to developing whole people.

But even more gratifying are the sommelier's selections, which make very few nods to the mainstream. Some of the more intriguing whites we had included refreshing Italian Pecorino (the grape, not the cheese) from Abruzzo, crisp Txakolina from Spain's Basque country and the outstanding Turley White Coat, a blend of three fashionable Rhone varietals, Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier. The reds were just as effective, like the almond-y Dolcetto D'Alba from Italy's Piedmont and Lioco Indica, a lusty California blend of Carignan and Petite Syrah. We got luxury pours, too, like Montaudon Champagne to start one evening, and magnificent Chateau Rieussec, one of the great French Sauternes, to pair with the foie gras.
In the Bay Area districts with large autism enrollments, 12 percent of students had an aide, records show. But students stand a far better chance of getting one if they live in San Ramon Valley Unified or Pleasanton than in Cupertino, San Francisco or New Haven. In San Ramon Valley, for example, 39 percent of autistic children have a personal aide.

Uggie "is really essential in the entire storytelling process...George Valentin is very selfish and eccentric, but the fact is the dog loves him throughout the movie...So the audience trusts the dog and if the dog follows him, he must be a good person," Hazanavicius told Reuters.
Foote's dramatic method could strike some as pedestrian -- avant-garde he most certainly wasn't -- and his subject matter might seem overly circumscribed, especially to those who judge a work by grand themes rather than poignant depths. He adored innovators -- dancer and choreographer Martha Graham especially -- but as an artist, he decided to stick with what he knew best, which meant carpentered realism inspired by his small-town Southern past.
Each of us entered the room to face our three attackers. Each of us, even a woman so tiny the rest of us could have picked her up and carried her under one arm, used just the right moves -- depending on how we were attacked -- to break free and run.
Meanwhile, back at the highway, the relationship between Dale and Andrea continues to play out like that of an overbearing father and his icy teenage daughter. To get a little space, Andrea goes off on a little ghost walk with Daryl, leading to one of the coolest scenes of the season so far.
5. Carefully flip over the mold and tap the bottom of the silicone mold three times to release the Cupcake Bath Fizzie from the mold. After un-molding the bath fizzie, immediately spritz it with a light spray of Witch Hazel. (If the cupcake crumbles when un-molding, place back into the big bowl, spritz with Witch Hazel, mix thoroughly and pack the mold again.)
Evanescence is, by all indications, still very much a thing.
"What I’m asking my treasurer to analyze for me is which one he thinks is going to be more stimulative to job growth," Christie said. "Both can’t happen this year, because we have a constitutional requirement to balance the budget."
We found it! The Sterling Lil' Blossom 12" is lilac, has a doll carrier and training wheels, and is $129.99. Gotta be honest — wish I'd had one of these when I was little. Mom and Dad will be by to pick it up.
She attributes the surge to a desire for "more meaningful travel experiences" and to the Internet, where travelers are discovering new places and adventures.

In the wake of her unsuccessful bid for the concertmaster's chair in Minneapolis, the Boston-born, Philadelphia-trained Kwak, in time-honored fashion, is going west -- to Portland, Ore., where this fall she becomes concertmaster of the Oregon Symphony. Her timing seems perfect. The Portland-based band, which made an acclaimed Carnegie Hall debut last year, is on a roll. (Her husband, longtime Minnesota Orchestra violinist Vali Phillips, won a position in the Oregon Symphony earlier this season.)
Quinn's recent flirtation with realism - a plan to raise the retirement age to 67 and cap pension cost-of-living adjustments - is less significant than the continuing unrealistic expectation that some Illinois' pension investments will grow 8.5 percent annually. Although the state Constitution mandates balancing the budget, this is almost meaningless while the state sells bonds to pay for operating expenses (in just 10 years the state's bonded debt has increased from $9.4 billion to $30 billion), underfunds pensions and other liabilities, and makes vendors wait (they are owed $5.6 billion).
Pipelines make great targets and will probably just line the pockets of the Koch brothers. But they won't help a lot of regular folks.
From that point on, the Capitals played like they knew they were going to win the game. A two-goal margin can provide that confidence. So can a hot goalie.

Pelagia: Designed by the same firm as Caretta on the Gulf, Pelagia may be the prettiest hotel restaurant in the area, with its hand-glazed tiles, custom ironwork and cheery blown-glass light fixtures. Proffering some of the bay area's best Italian, or Cal-Ital or even Nuevo-Ital, the kitchen is overseen by local superstar chef Fabrizio Schenardi. Opened in 2004, the restaurant had a tiny facelift last year, hardly necessary as the bold palate in the dining room elegantly echoes chef Schenardi's lush cuisine. Dive into an order of his justifiably famous meat-stuffed fried olives or a plate of delicate octopus flavored with garlic and mint. Vegetarians can revel in a generous platter of grilled portobellos, eggplant, peppers and squash, their smokiness contrasting beautifully with a bowl of "gazpacho dipping sauce," which really amounted to a warm puree of tomatoes, peppers and cukes, jazzed up perfectly with a splash of vinegar.

President Barack Obama arrived in South Korea on Wednesday for a meeting of the Group of 20 major industrial and emerging economies. The administration is pushing for the other countries to agree to set targets for current account trade balances as a way to rebalance growth.

Even by his high standards, Springsteen, who will bring his band to Madison Square Garden on Friday and Monday, has something special going on right now — and he’s acting like he knows it. All his bets have come in. Asking the untried Jake Clemons to stand in for his late, legendary uncle was a risky move, but night after night, the young saxophonist demonstrates that he’s a natural showman with ample reserves of self-confidence. The "new" 18-piece E Street Band could have been a train wreck of clashing treble, bass and percussion; instead, the musicians have been so enthusiastic and mutually respectful that the enormous arrangements somehow feel intimate. The confrontational populist politics of the "Wrecking Ball" album could have turned off fans weary of endless debate; instead, the new songs are getting cheers.

One of the areas in which Anderson has already received high marks is fundraising. He has taken advantage of the excitement surrounding Turgeon in particular, with the advent of the Sweet 16 booster group whose members will donate $50,000 each for five years and is in the process of putting together a similar group of 22 boosters (at $22,000 a year) for football.

Some can't always pay for their prescriptions, but Don doesn't mind. Life in a small town makes you all family. You learn to accept everyone as is, because they're all you got.
The Landmarks Commission and the historic neighborhood design review boards do a fine job. My biggest concern is that with all the foreclosures, a lot of the fabric of non-historically designated neighborhoods will be lost to the wrecking ball. Ultimately, 10 years from now, we don't want to have neighborhoods where there are "missing teeth" -- no buildings and no memories of how special the neighborhoods were.

If you make it out to Cassia, you're not far from Barberville Produce, a quirky landmark at the corner of U.S. Highway 17 and State Road 40. You can buy peanuts, honey and produce, of course, but the real attraction is the cast-aluminum Clydesdales and roosters out front. It's like Noah's boarding area.
The government continues to aggressively cross-examine Elwell, who first took the stand on Monday in his own defense. (The trial was in recess on Wednesday, resuming today.) The nine-year mayor of Secaucus is facing the prospect of spending years in jail after being charged with taking a $10,000 cash bribe in May 2009 from the now-disgraced developer-turned-government-informant, Solomon Dwek. The government alleges Elwell took $10,000 in exchange for his support of a purported hotel project Dwek wanted to place in Secaucus.

Earlier this month, the Spurs announced that Parker would likely miss two to four weeks with a sprained calf muscle. He wound up missing just one game.
While the 40-year-old Mr. Abramovich now spends much of his time in London, he and other oligarchs are seen as symbols of a new Russian system that places huge riches in the hands of a few. Russia's richest man, Mr. Abramovich has flourished under President Vladimir Putin. Critics say he made much of his fortune from political connections and, like many oligarchs, used his government ties to take over former state-owned assets and reap the profits for personal use. Mr. Abramovich controlled OAO Sibneft, the oil giant, and sold it in 2005 to a state-controlled gas company for $13 billion.
With USC coach Lane Kiffin and his family in attendance, Barkley announced Thursday that while he feels prepared for the NFL, he has unfinished business with the Trojans. His announcement set off cheers from the roughly 200 people who attended his news conference at USC's Heritage Hall.
The producers will probably opt to keep Joshua around for a while, thinking his abrasive personality and arrogant posturing make for good TV. After this episode, though, I can see why Cecilia decided getting the heck away from it all was a good idea.
When the county revised its laws last year under legislation introduced by Kamenetz, it exempted sports tickets from the list of gifts that officials are not allowed to take. It also did not require officials to report such tickets.

What he means is that if someone never pays a dime for insurance (and never has an employer buy it for him, either) but suddenly falls ill, insurers should nonetheless give him insurance, and at the same rate they charge everyone else -- and cover his medical bills.

She went on to explain that one of the ways that the Ambassadors determine how healthy streams and rivers are is to take water samples and count the number of each species of animal that are present. Some macro-invertebrates, such as cadisfly, mayfly and stonefly larvae, are pollution-intolerant and can only live in clean water. Others, such as sowbug, damselfly and dragonfly larvae, are pollution-sensitive and can live in water that is only slightly dirty. Finding only leeches, flatworms and midgefly larvae in a stream would mean there is a big pollution problem because these organisms are pollution-tolerant.
That, however, is not why she sponsored the blunt wrap measure. In an initial interview, Brandom told a reporter she sponsored the bill after "friends" expressed concern about the issue.

Redistricting and reapportionment take place every 10 years, in the year following the U.S. census. Population loss documented by the 2010 census means Ohio will lose two congressional seats, leaving the state with 16 members of the U.S. House of Representatives who will be elected in 2012.

Other mayors' travel budgets pale compared with Ogden's. Sherwood Mayor Keith Mays, who is Ogden's most comparable contemporary, shares a $9,000 budget with his six-member council and the city recorder. In neighboring Tigard, the mayor's travel budget is less than half that of Ogden's, at $9,000. The bigger city of Beaverton, which has a full-time mayor serving also as the top administrative official, who also travels out of the country, appropriates $13,900 for mayoral travel.

The wonderful thing is that an ugly old T-shirt taking up space in your drawer can become something much, much better with a good-quality pair of scissors and a little ingenuity. You can cut new necks or sleeves and holes in strategic places, do lacing or ties. With two swipes of the sewing machine, a boxy shirt becomes a baby T. You can do shirring or ruching (i.e., making attractive wrinkles or bunches), make ruffles or add lace or ribbons, safety pins or other embellishments. T-shirts can become skirts, shorts or bags.

“Just as North Jersey needs one, we need one,” said Riley. “I understand why the report went that way. Does that mean we couldn’t have a partnership?

I’m happy the governor is looking at this and looking at South Jersey.”

The deal cements Afghanistan as a "major non-NATO ally" of the U.S., a designation—shared by Pakistan and Israel, among others—meant to signify the country's role as an important strategic ally of the U.S. It states that the U.S. doesn't want permanent military bases in Afghanistan and won't use the country to launch offensive attacks in the region. It didn't, however, specify funding or troop levels.
To start with, not all sausages are made the same. Some pork bangers, such as the Irish-style links made by North Country Smokehouse, contain as little as 6 grams of fat each. Lower-fat chicken and turkey sausages also would be a good choice. To make the mash a bit healthier, this recipe blends small red potatoes (with skins), cooked kale, tangy buttermilk, zesty coarse-grained mustard and only a tiny pat of butter. The result is deliciously similar to the classic Irish dish called colcannon. The gravy, also spiked with mustard, is made with reduced-sodium chicken broth, onions, flour and very little oil, so you can say goodbye to the grease.
"It's nice to see the Reds commit to their talent, but at what point in the 10 year length of this contract does the contract go from being an asset to being a liability. He is 28 now and will be 38 when the contract expires. My guess is that after 4 or 5 years (at most) they will try and dump his contract on one of the big market teams. Don't forget, he's not getting $22.5 million each year. No doubt the numbers are smaller up front and bigger on the back end.

Suppose you elect to win the opening lead in hand and cross to dummy with a trump, East discarding a heart. You now lead a low diamond, inserting the king when East follows low. When it wins, continue with a diamond. Since East has no more trumps, you can win any return and use your club entries to ruff two diamonds in dummy. That gives you 12 tricks - five spades, three clubs, a trick in each red suit and two diamond ruffs.

I think you've opened many readers eyes to understanding what one's final days can become, rather than what they should be. Each of us will die, no one escapes, and to allow the old and infirm person and the family to accept this as fact, is probably the greatest gift the medical community could bestow. As you said, just because a treatment can be given, doesn't mean it should.

Bayless and Ladue have had the lowest operating tax rates in St. Louis County. A decline in enrollment coupled with a poor economy has Bayless in dire financial straits, with some worried that spending down the district's rainy day fund could lead the state to strip the school district's accreditation. District leaders say the passage of the increase will restore bus transportation they cut two years ago and prevent $1 million more in cuts for 2012-13.

More broadly, the problem with the hypocrisy argument is that most of us are hypocrites, if hypocrisy is defined as failing to live up to standards of behavior we endorse in the abstract. Granted, as Shakespeare showed in "Measure for Measure" and Spitzer showed on CNN, the downfall of a moralistic prig is great theater. But in the moral calculus, it's not the hypocrisy, stupid; it's the behavior that exposes it.
