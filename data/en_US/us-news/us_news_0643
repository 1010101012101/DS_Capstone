The way Ohio puts inmates to death has been under scrutiny since 2009, when executioners tried unsuccessfully for nearly two hours to insert a needle into the veins of Romell Broom, sentenced to die for raping and killing a 14-year-old Cleveland girl. Then-Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat, eventually called the execution off, and Broom remains on death row, arguing in court filings that Ohio shouldn't be allowed a second try at executing him.

Here he pulls no punches when it comes to the horrors of the arena and delivers an emotionally tense and dynamic film. There's not much filler here as Ross gives the characters enough room to come into their own while convincingly laying out their motivations.

Ahead 1-0 with four outs to get, the Cubs brought in closer Carlos Marmol to complete the four-out save.

To be fair, Mr. Caro had done himself no favors with this crowd by pumping up in his second volume (1990's "Means of Ascent") Johnson's rival in the 1948 U.S. Senate race, the racist Coke Stevenson, as the radiant if somewhat old-fashioned counterpoint to Johnson's dark star. To them, the preferred characterization of LBJ was to be found in a work of fiction: Billy Lee Brammer's classic "The Gay Place" (1961), in which the Lone Star State is lorded over with profane benevolence by Gov.

Obama is not ignoring the economy. To do so would seem out of touch, a perception that doomed President George H.W. Bush when he sought reelection during a similar time of economic anxiety in 1992. (That campaign yielded Democrat Bill Clinton's famous slogan — "It's the economy, stupid" — which Romney refashioned this week with a caustic twist: "It's still the economy, and we're not stupid."

Most parents are dedicated to raising their children to be compassionate, honest, and productive members of the society, and they discipline their children when they make mistakes. The parents of these juveniles should have issued apologies and stopped the "jamboree" in the court.

Will they respect the law and lives and property of others?

He was the department's expert on high explosives. He also apparently had a strategy to use his forces to fight a major conflagration.
Now Jing-Mei — the play's lead narrator — is being schooled by the remaining three members of her mother's mahjong group. Suyuan (Donna Hansen) launched the gathering after she immigrated to San Francisco from China in the late 1940s.
"I have never seen such creativity," said summit moderator David Cooperrider, a professor at the Weatherhead School of Business at Case Western Reserve University.
Still, the executive summary of the proposed budget did not specify how services would be affected. But the summary did include details of how federal grants would help save the jobs of firefighters and police officers, often lightning-rod positions with residents. And, at times, with council members, who for the first time are not in control of what will eventually become the city's spending plan.
Actually, thanks to some rhetorical double-bookkeeping, Giuliani was able to cram abortion-related issues into his 80% solution. True, he alluded to his own longtime pro-choice position by noting that "people of good conscience come to different conclusions about whether abortions should be legal in some circumstances" (an assertion that is anathema to many Values Voters). But then he turned on the fudge machine.

PISCATAWAY— Rutgers (24-27, 9-13 Big East) dropped its conference finale as they failed to capitalize on late scoring chances.
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The Wells Fargo Championship looks like it will be missing Tiger Woods on the weekend for the third straight year.
The duo posted some music online in early 2011 but that project was put on hold after other big life events occurred: Baldwin got married (to Eric Baldwin of the band We Are Voices); Crawford became a father. He also became the drummer in the Beautiful Bodies while still a member of Now Now Sleepyhead, a project founded by his friend Phil Park, the band's guitarist and vocalist.
Mr. Byrne, the Colorado lawyer, acted as Ms. Gu's primary contact during the U.S. case. "She was very sharp, and fortunately her English was very good," he recalled recently.
India and Pakistan were close to such an agreement in 2007. But the then-secret negotiations foundered as Pakistan's president at the time, Pervez Musharraf, became entangled in political troubles at home that led to his resignation the following year.
"Regardless of your support or opposition, this resolution is about ensuring meaningful and open debate," the Cleveland Democrat told colleagues on the House floor. "This is going to be the first opportunity to evaluate critically where the authorization of the use of military force has taken us in the past eight and a half years."
Experts say fees will likely continue to drop as more plans turn to ETFs and press investment managers to lower charges. Nevada's Upromise plan is the second to offer ETFs almost exclusively, following Arkansas's adviser-sold iShares 529 plan. Arkansas's average fees are about 0.6%, while the average fees in adviser-sold plans are 1.14%, according to the FRC.
The ideal reader of this book might be a religious believer who doubts the existence of God and all the other supernatural window dressing, but hesitates to discard faith out of a fear that, without the ethical framework it provides, chaos would reign. By separating the enlightening wheat from the superstitious chaff, de Botton may make it easier for such a person to take the skeptical plunge. In fact, a more candid title might have been "Atheism for the Religious."
The cleanest way to look at this, I figured, would be to examine the impact on working students of two often debated, though usually separate, topics: the increasing cost of college and the minimum wage.
In the future, Newark will have to pay $2.7 million a year to the Devils in parking revenue, practically neutralizing the average $3 million in annual rent payments owed to the city over the past four years.
"You could see someone birdie the last three holes to come from behind and win the tournament," Janzen said. "But there's just enough trouble that things could change (at the top). It's also not a lock the leader can par those last three to win."
Finally forced to sit for most of the third quarter, James wasn't mad, and the Miami Heat wasn't worried.
"We're going to have a long road ahead of us," said Council President Barbara Johnson, who represents part of the affected area.
The Wilkins had worried that the earthquake would prolong the already long adoption process. They feared months of paperwork were lost amid the rubble of government buildings.
Forward Sebastien Le Toux, who was a thorn in Sporting KC's side throughout the first half, finished off a scramble in the 79th minute with a header past goalie Jimmy Nielsen, who saw nearly as much action against the Whitecaps as he had the first six games combined.
A percentage of that money will go to Cape as assistant manager, according to the agreement.
The county also has a two-floor medical ward at the jail and employs 50 registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and other health care providers to take care of patients. On a typical day, pregnant women make up about 10 percent of the jail population; at least 10 inmates are known to be HIV-positive; and jail workers transport a number of inmates outside the facility for dialysis.
Use a keyboard - Adding a wireless keyboard can add $30-$150 to the price of the tablet, but it's worth it. Typing on the tablet's screen is fine for emails or tweets, but it's a clunky and slow process for longer written pieces.
Pilate said it's more likely Operation Rescue either received nonmedical records, such as sign-in sheets containing names and ages of patients, or was able to piece together patient information that had been shredded. She said the clinic will look at options such as incineration to make sure discarded records don't fall into the wrong hands.
But more could have been made of the score's surprises, other than the impressive way the second violins dived in after the opening clarinet solo faded.
In the first drawing, Cleveland (21-45) won a tiebreaker with New Orleans (21-45) and now ranks third, with 138 chances out of 1,000, for the No. 1 pick in the 14-team NBA lottery. New Orleans, now fourth, will have 137 chances. Even if the maximum three teams behind the Cavs move up in the lottery, the Cavs will pick no worse than sixth.
It might take all of UO coach Chip Kelly’s X-and-O brilliance to get everybody the requisite touches. It’s exactly the kind of challenge Kelly loves. He made the James-Barner, scatback tandem work last year.
Even though it was only January, the Beavers had particular reason to be playing with desperation. Having gone 10-2 in nonconference play to generate speculation that they could challenge for the conference title, they entered Thursday's game at 1-3 in Pac-12 play after losing in four overtimes to Stanford last Saturday in Corvallis.
"Everyone was just doing their job," he said. "This was a relatively small inconvenience compared to what she's been through the last few months."
LG will sell a remote with its high-end flat-panel TVs that contains a microphone. You'll be able to speak into the microphone to enter text on the TV for Twitter updates and Web searches. You won't be able to change the channel or control the volume by yelling at the TV.
"Building the vehicle was much harder than I thought it would be," Smith said. "The challenges of making something go on water and on land well are counter to each other."
Q: Is it difficult to act stoned?
I try to visit during the twice-yearly retail sales in late July and January for some amazing price reductions (room rates tend to be lower then, too). And even if you visit for just a night or two, Vegas is the ideal base to explore the natural wonders of the Southwest (I think the most memorable trip I've ever taken was a circle trip from Vegas to the Grand Canyon, Bryce, Zion, Monument Valley, and Mesa Verde, staying in the iconic national park lodges).
To accommodate three bedrooms and an updated bathroom, Rehkamp Larson gutted and renovated the second floor.
"It’s not as if they’re going to deduct 10 points because the governor had a nasty clash with the union," Jennings said. "It’s all a matter of how many points you gain for each element of the application. By not agreeing with the teachers union, the state is losing points. Then again, its comparative. You have to know what’s in all 36 applications (from other competing states)."
With the recipes and how-tos, you'll be confident enough to cook just about any large piece of meat or whole fish. That way, you can remain practically stress-free. At least when it comes to cooking the main course.
"It was humbling," Pryor told Sports Illustrated. "A mistake I made when I was a freshman by selling my pants for $3,000 just took away everything from me. I was just driven into the ground. I was the worst person in the world. My face popped up on the screen, and it seemed like I was the only one who did anything. ...
That first week Milligan got a call from the Yellow cabbie who'd driven Marissa to the city. He felt horrible and blamed himself. She assured him it wasn't his fault. Milligan and her family planned Marissa's memorial, which drew about 600 people to Santa Rosa's St. Rose Catholic Church, and arranged for her ashes to be interred at Calvary Cemetery. The family went ahead with plans to get away from all the Christmas craziness by spending a few days on the beach at Aptos. Stopping at the Golden Gate Bridge toll plaza, Milligan asked the toll taker whom they could talk to about somebody who'd jumped off the bridge.
''Even though Mr. Travolta and his counsel are on opposing sides in this matter, I do wish them good health, happiness, and want them to be judged with absolute fairness as our great nation affords all citizens regardless of their wealth or station.''
The producers hope their buyers — Caprice Willard of Macy's, Terron E. Schaefer of Saks and Nicole Christie of H&M — will become famous in their own right. But the show doesn't forgo more established stars. Supermodel Elle Macpherson is the host, and Jessica Simpson, Nicole Richie and John Varvatos act as "celebrity mentors." Their presence further reinforces the idea that "Fashion Star" is about real-world shopping rather than high-concept design. Varvatos makes wearable menswear, and Simpson and Richie are among a recent wave of young female stars who've converted their fame into cash via clothing lines.
Los Angeles 4, Toronto 3: Albert Pujols finally hit a home run for the host Angels, ending the longest power drought of his career. Pujols connected in the fifth inning for his first AL homer and his 446th overall. Pujols had gone 139 at-bats dating to last year without a home run in the regular season.
Shame on the district for proposing to cut almost two weeks of classes next year for school-age children ("S.F. teachers set for a strike vote," May 8). Shame on the district for proposing to cut almost six weeks from its year-round preschool program.
She also rejected suggestions that the spy's lifestyle could have made him vulnerable.
The decision to formally charge Bales did nothing to dampen the anger of Mohammed Wazir, who lost 11 family members -- including his mother, wife, four daughters and two sons -- in the rampage.

Rosemary Palmer, Augie's mother, started to cry, too. "It's happy tears," she said. "It's part of a continuum of life, and it means Augie has not been forgotten."
The most recent Indians pitcher to win two games in which he walked six or more batters was Rick Sutcliffe in 1982.
Every team in the NBA features at least one advance scout, and the Blazers, who place a priority on it, are one of five teams that feature two: Greer and Jim Sleeper. Their jobs are to attend games of upcoming Blazers opponents, learn as much as they can about the teams and report back to coach Nate McMillan and his staff. The staff, with guidance from Greer and Sleeper, then create a game plan.
Heated clothing is an old idea. Hunters, hikers and other winter-sports enthusiasts have long tried various strategies to beat the cold, from tucking hot water bottles and heated stones in their pockets to relying on devices that use chemical reactions to generate heat.

Its Thursday, Mickelson said when asked which day this week has been most important to this run. Because at some point on this golf course, Im going to get hot, make birdies, maybe an eagle here or there. At some point, Im going to get on the leaderboard. Staying in it on Thursday allowed me to make a run.
“I have lots to learn and find out, and I'm going to dive right in,” she said.
The store's hours are set to be 11 a.m.-8 p.m. Monday through
Two sitting rooms are filled with antique leather wing chairs and pieces upholstered in various Kime fabrics. The walls are hung with art from the Brakas' own impressive and varied collection: a drawing by Lucian Freud, a very good copy of a Magritte that Braka once owned, Victorian hunting scenes, and even a print of Landseer's "Monarch of the Glen." The dining room includes works by Paula Rego, an enormous elk head over the fireplace, a homoerotic drawing tucked beside a window and several other pieces worthy of an auction catalog. The effect is as it should be in someone's home: art that's pleasing to be with but not screaming from the walls.
I thanked him for agreeing to do the show. He and his Blitzen Trapper bandmates had just completed the kind of SXSW schedule that could rip a singer's voice bare, and followed that up with a 10-day trip to Australia, which they'd only just gotten back from.
"If you can find someplace to shop, you're good to go," she said.
Little had the hottest hand in the first round with 23 of 36 winners, including all but two games on the right side of his bracket. His only misses there were picking No. 5 Temple and No. 4 Michigan.

Last meal: Two green-chili burritos, french fries and ketchup, vanilla ice cream, cream soda and a cigarette.
"When I first read it I had the ideas of the characters that Whit writes in my head," Gerwig said. "I kept trying to place the words into a more conventional world. And I realized that was wrong-headed. He's doing something totally different. It's not in the same world as 'Last Days of Disco' or 'Metropolitan' or 'Barcelona.' It's in this heightened, fever-dream ecstatic, comic, almost mental breakdown world."
Desserts (all $8) from pastry chef Mary Beth Marks are solid, including a chocolate torte. Pistachio-almond lemon cake was homier, but the lemon syrup made it a little too sweet. Our favorite dessert was the chiffon cake, with a pool of tangy lemon curd, strawberries and whipped cream.
The accident occurred at 3 p.m. and Krupacs was pronounced dead at the scene due to head injuries at 3:38 p.m. Kelly suffered leg injuries and was taken to Newton Medical Center for treatment.
That and some big time pitching from Kelly has Preston believing it can make a much deeper playoff run than years past as they build toward a bright future.
The defending World Series champions begin their title defense Wednesday as an impressive but perhaps fragile mix of talent, experience, doggedness and uncertainty. It's not enough that they seek to become the first National League team to repeat as champions since the Big Red Machine Cincinnati Reds. They also must overcome the side effects from a grueling regular-season salvage operation and a three-tiered postseason in which they defeated three favored teams.
øAt every level, each person dutifully checks off their customer service goals:
In the case of my son, the investment paid off. We called him the Lego Boy by the time he was 5, his skill and fascination with the tiny blocks was so great. Today, he’s in college studying automobile engineering. His early Lego passion seems to have been a clear predictor of where he has ended up.
The suspect remained at large today, one day after the encounter with Galloway Township officer Ronald Gorneau.
Clinton arrived in the eastern city of Kolkata — the first secretary of state to visit the former colonial capital of 14 million — on Sunday after visits to China and Bangladesh as officials traveling with her said the Iranian oil imports would top an agenda that includes India's relations with nuclear rival Pakistan and the future of Afghanistan.

The main towboat and a helper boat from Luhr Brothers Inc. took the Admiral to the company's facility near Columbia, Ill. There, the boat's three remaining decks will be scrapped. Kline said a decision had yet to be made on what to do with the Admiral's hull, which dates to 1907.
"The idea is to move to a situation where the city can continuously and automatically monitor for leaks," said Peter Williams, IBM's project manager. "Almost no cities in the world currently do this."
Of course, the Kimberley also has man-eating saltwater crocodiles and an unsettlingly large number of the Earth's most poisonous snakes, spiders and jellyfish. But in reality, a dangerous encounter is rare, unless you're like the recent Aussie visitor to Broome who had one too many at the pub, broke into the wildlife park and tried to ride Fatso, a 16-foot, 1,700-pound saltwater croc. The local TV newscaster reporting the mauling could barely contain his mirth, asking, "Did Fatso get any fatter?" and blaming the man's idiocy on the fact he was from "an Eastern city," meaning Sydney or Melbourne. Western Australians like to distance themselves from the other coast.
"My only thought is we have some priorities that I don't think we're taking care of, and one of them is rebounding," said Karl, whose team allowed the Lakers' top-three bigs to grab 10, 10 and nine rebounds. "They're bigger than we are, heavier than we are. I think that's why we lost the game in the second half."
15. New England (17) - Haven't won in seven consecutive games and falling further out of playoff contention.

Garden sheds used to be dank, dusty outbuildings designed solely to store lawn mowers, hoses, tools and pots. No longer. Today's garden shed is still big on storage, but it also has lots of style.
On my first day back at the Foreign Ministry, my heart ached. It was like visiting a graveyard. And almost like visiting my own grave: Because I've survived two bombings since 2003, people joke and tell me my chances for survival a third time are slim.
Dawn McLean, 55, was a nurse for 25 years in Oregon and Washington before retiring and moving to the Twin Cities to be close to her daughter's family. She was looking for a job that matched her interest in helping children -- "I've always loved children and loved reading," she said -- but she also needed something that offered pay and benefits. However, even with her retirement money to supplement it, her stipend of about $900 a month means "I can't afford to do this probably more than a second year," McLean said. "It's a volunteer commitment almost. It's sort of like a domestic Peace Corps, really."
"We got a little lax," admitted James, who finished with 47 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. "The momentum of the shooting ... we can't continue to make some of the shots that we did."
Organizers declined to comment about the litigation. They also are not ready to say where they may move the event.
If you took the traditional TV cop drama and dumped it into "The Twilight Zone," you might have something resembling NBC's "Awake." Intrigued? You should be. This is one sly and intriguing newcomer to the prime-time ranks.
The teens told troopers the 8:30 p.m. attack occurred as the prepared for a river crossing. The bear attacked Berg first, turned to another student, then turned back to Berg, Palmer said.

That of course will be after he completes his junior paper, the topic of which is monarchies’ connection to the Navy in early 20th-century Britain.
Michigan, however, is fighting back. Manufacturing jobs are returning, and Ford, GM and Chrysler have all posted profits. If Romney had his way, and Detroit went bankrupt, the American auto industry would have been an afterthought.
Andrea said she and the other students were threatened with disciplinary action for walking out, "but we did it anyway."
It was nice sentiment, but LeBron James and the Miami Heat removed any doubt about the outcome as quickly and easily as Magic Marker wiped from a dry-erase board.
Tadich began life as the Coffee Stand located in a tent on the nearly mile-long Long Wharf (now Commercial Street), serving coffee and food to sailors and merchants. It moved to the New World Market in 1855 and was renamed the New World Coffee Stand. After several other changes, its moniker became Tadich Grill, The Original Cold Day Restaurant when Croatian immigrant John Tadich took over as sole owner in 1912 and moved the restaurant.
Radiation therapy can be delivered in a few ways - external beam, radiation seed implantation and proton beam. External beam radiation therapy involves multiple short treatments, about 40. Seed implantation, called brachytherapy, is a single-placement treatment in which high-intensity radioactive seeds are placed into the prostate.
"This is a bump in the road because of the message that it sends to people looking to do business in Ohio and people looking to keep doing business in Ohio and the position they see John in," said former Ohio Republican congressman David Hobson, who served in Congress and on the same budget committee with Kasich.
STEUBENVILLE, Ohio — Gov. John Kasich delivered his second State of the State address on Tuesday, a lengthy speech light on new ideas and heavy on issues the Republican leader has frequently touted since taking office a year ago.
Why we recommend passage: By a slender margin, district voters last May declined to renew an improvements levy for this academically excellent district, even though it involved no new taxes. That's a sign of pain in a district where 30 percent of students are needy. Cloverleaf has done its part to slash costs, cutting teachers and other staff, freezing administrative pay, eliminating nonessential field trips and charging $200 to play per high school sport -- although teachers need to do more to rein in salary increases in these hard times.
That's why it was encouraging in March to see the City Council vote 6-1 to expand the Tony Nelssen Equestrian Center at WestWorld and make it a larger, multiuse facility that can handle existing events as well as additional ones. Now the city needs to develop a master plan for the whole area, including some sort of Desert Discovery Center and an outdoor amphitheater looking at the McDowells.

Brown, who is poles apart from Romney on most trade issues, suggested Thursday that "the best thing that Gov. Romney can do is pick up the phone and call John Boehner," the speaker of the House, to get him to pass the currency bill.
In the 1980s and '90s, capital punishment was a staple of Republican campaigns against a handful of liberals who bravely stuck with their opposition to the ultimate punishment. George H.W. Bush used the issue effectively against Democrat Mike Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign, and so did Republicans in their 1994 electoral sweep, notably in defeating three-term Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo in New York. And no wonder: In 1994, support for the death penalty hit its peak of 80 percent nationwide.
Though most grains can be used interchangeably, that does not mean they are all the same. Flavor-wise, they may all be variations on "nutty," but with specifics ranging from earthy (barley, wheat berry and farro) to more vegetable-like (quinoa, bulgur and millet).
But the Roberts brothers on Monday confidently laid out plans to keep ownership stakes in most of their current holdings, while seeking a large investment in their hotels from a hedge fund or other large investor. They said they have equity totaling up to $35 million in the six hotels caught up in the Bank of America dispute. They said they had personally invested $135 million in acquisition and renovation costs, not including about $11 million in operating losses, in their 11 hotels. So walking away from the properties would make no sense, the brothers said, and the hotels are worth more to potential investors as a group than individually.
Woods withdrew in the middle of the final round at the 2010 Players Championship with what turned out to be a neck injury. A year ago, he stopped after a 42 on the front nine with an injury to his Achilles tendon that kept him out of golf until August.
The town square was covered in deep drifts, public works director Walter Burnett said, leading officials to barricade off the area Wednesday and start hauling the snow away, one dump truck load at a time. By noon Thursday, the area reopened and the city's streets were mostly clear of what proved to be an impressive load of snow, he said.

As a result of Chrysler's 2009 bankruptcy and federal government bailout, the union cannot strike the company over contract terms. If there is an impasse, the two sides would go to binding arbitration, a process that could take months.
Marcus Haber equalized with a header in the 32nd minute, but just a minute later Alan Pulido restored Mexico's advantage.
The Essex County Prosecutor’s Office added Jones’ death to the Newark homicide total for 2009 following the medical examiner’s determination. However, Newark police have not yet officially classified the death a homicide, despite having assigned one of its detectives to the case. Perhaps because Jones didn’t die this year, the Newark police’s homicide total still stood at 66 killings through Wednesday. Newark police officials would not comment on the discrepancy.
So Ohio Democratic chief Chris Redfern is asking: Exactly what is Mandel's work schedule like?
much of the anticipated benefit from the tax cut will be lost. Christopher estimates half to two-thirds of the extra cash will ultimately go toward higher gas prices. Food prices have also risen in recent months, he noted.
The action is set entirely in the high school where Dane (Josh Caras) was a student, and Lee Savage's set is a perfect combo of green linoleum and cream-colored walls.
Obama's speech is intended to serve as a bookend to the major speech he delivered in December in Kansas, where he said the American middle class is at a "make-or-break moment." He invoked a Republican predecessor, Theodore Roosevelt, in railing against growing income inequality.
“The story of Central Asia Institute and Greg Mortenson evokes notions of the best of our aspirations to do good and the generosity of the American public,” Montana Atty. Gen. Steve Bullock wrote about the charity, based in Bozeman, Mont. “It involves the efforts of a complicated person who has worked tirelessly on behalf of a noble pursuit, even while acting in a way that jeopardized that pursuit.”
"We believe shareholders should be concerned with the company's failure to adequately link pay to performance," Glass Lewis said in its report.
"It's a wonderful opportunity to be able to have a high-level dialogue with the administration on keeping the momentum going for us as we transition our economy," said NorTech President and CEO Rebecca Bagley.
What happens if the sun doesn't shine or the wind dies down? That requires updating the grid system to respond flexibly to changing weather conditions. As materials for the governor's two-day conference this week at UCLA pointed out, "power systems around the world are successfully accommodating variable generation at levels of penetration that were deemed to be impossible by many, even just a few years ago."
In excess, coffee, and more particularly, caffeine, can cause problems. But the fretting about two or three cups a day, or even more, is fading as study results suggestive of health benefits from coffee keep on coming in.
"It's really exciting when you first get on the headset with your mentor. The first day is getting used to everything and what his personality is. I was really shocked to find out he's British. The graphing is totally different. WTS is a good program, It deserves more support," he said.

"The only talk we've had is about working hard and getting to New Orleans," Arizona State receiver Gerell Robinson said. "As much as everybody wants to go to the Rose Bowl, I mean, I've been to California. I haven't been to New Orleans yet. That's our mindset, to be honest with you."
When things got busy the night I was there, a fuse blew. "Breaker!" a cook called, and Passot went to the circuit breaker to restore power. The stoves, the burners, the pots and pans are worn, though meticulously scrubbed after each service, and the cooks, crammed shoulder to shoulder, dance around each other, deftly opening or dodging refrigerator drawers and sharing burner space. I jumped in to help as service revved up at 7 p.m., running to the walk-in, plating the amuse bouche, passing plates. At the height of service, with seven cooks, one expeditor, a handful of runners and me, I could barely take a step without almost smashing into something or someone.
Shares of Energizer Holdings tumbled 5 percent Tuesday after the company said 2011 fiscal year earnings would be lower than analysts had been forecasting.

Tim Hodson, a widely recognized expert on California politics who spent 35 years working, teaching and preparing future leaders for the state Capitol, died Tuesday at age 61.
Such extremes are characteristic of the work of Mishima. A novelist, playwright, essayist and critic, he’s regarded as one of the most important figures in post-war Japanese letters, his exalted reputation dimmed only by uneasiness over his turn to strident right-wing nationalism and his highly public ritual suicide in 1970. Mishima’s writing is beautiful, disciplined, psychologically incisive, often with a highly formal clarity and elegance. Yet his characters often are driven by pathological obsessions, and their stories can give way to shocking violence.

Any time is tiki time on the funky backyard patio of this Tremont hipster pub. With its shabby-chic retro tiki decor -- think your grandparents' backyard, circa 1958 -- it's a supercool spot to sit back with a G&T or Great Lakes draft and a one of Prosperity's spins on comfort classics (pita nachos to bratwurst sandwiches, pierogi to catfish tacos).

To me, the true test of a great restaurant is what you remember the next morning. After most meals, I might remember two or three dishes, but after eating at the French Laundry my recollections could fill a notebook: tender confit of veal heart glazed with a turnip glace; house-made truffle pappardelle, brown from its exquisite flavoring, glistening in butter and reinforced with perfect paper-thin rounds of more truffles; and a stunningly fresh roasted trumpet fish with an array of forest mushrooms and a drizzling of 50-year-old sherry vinegar. Sirloin of Wagyu has so much marbling that while it has the texture of beef, it also has the liquid essence of foie gras. Keller serves it with half moons of bone marrow bread pudding, tiny glazed carrots and a sauce Bordelaise.

When it comes to cooking, each type of grain takes its own treatment, but one thing they all seem to share is a love of toasting. A couple of minutes over medium heat in a dry pan deepens and enriches their flavors.

It's a good bet that the king went casual at Kaunolū, but when he wanted to dress to impress, he had the best of Hawai'i's artisans at his disposal. One stunning example is in the recently restored Hawaiian Hall at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, which displays Kamehameha's 'aha'ula (cloak) made of 60,000 yellow mamo feathers, only one or two of which could be found on a single bird. He's also shown wearing such a cloak in bronze statues in Hilo, in the Wailoa River State Recreation Area near the bay; Kapa'au, near his birthplace in North Kohala; and Honolulu, in front of the Ali'iolani Hale, home of the Hawai'i Supreme Court.

Sounds like a perfect solution for Selig, McCourt and Dodger fans. Japanese investors own part of the Seattle Mariners, so there is a precedent for overseas ownership.

This city spends real money, despite what some on council may think. Pacifica has a budget that has been historically consistent at around $25 million a year and provides many vital services. Our budget funds increasingly important programs such as the Resource Center. Many times, this is the last place people with nowhere to turn seek out.

In the midst of all this, as the center character, is John Ellingson and his puppet, Lowly Worm. Where the other characters speak very loudly, Ellingson is mute. Where the other characters exaggerate their expressions and movements, Ellingson's expressions and movements are refined and restrained. His pork pie hat and horizontally striped jumpsuit (by costumer Shana Targosz) evoke past mimes such as Buster Keaton and Marcel Marceau. Ellingson's manipulation of Lowly is so convincing that, when the puppet (with the Tyrolean hat and single red sneaker) simply looks around silently at the audience with his googly eyes, laughter comes along.

Fourth, Obama is now liberated from The Curse of 60 -- exactly the minimum number of senators necessary to move the party's agenda.

And had not Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter, facing defeat in a Republican primary, suddenly discovered -- who knew? -- that he really is a Democrat. And had not Minnesota Democrat Al Franken defeated incumbent Norm Coleman after an excruciatingly close election, followed by a protracted and controversial recount. And, perhaps, if Illinois, Delaware and New York had elected rather than appointed senators to replace Obama, Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton.

The other casualty of the extreme cold has been shoes. Since it was too cold to go out for very long, Ernie got restless and went back to his puppy chewing days.

You've got to rely on the people that are there," Ginger said. "That doesn't mean you might not have to do some training, communication and demonstration on how things are supposed to work.

Jon and his wife met us at the ranch's entrance, which, at 4,500 feet above sea level, looks out over the whole region. The ranch — four mid-sized cabins, one large three-bedroom lodge that would suit two families, a pool, a central courtyard and a refurbished Airstream trailer with a leopard-skin rug — was a thing of beauty. I especially liked the mix of old-school desert architecture and modern design, down to great poster art and what Sara called ironic taxidermy. Ian enjoyed all the open space, climbing up and down the stairs, and the various representations of animals. We left in much better moods than we'd arrived.

I found several affordable options among the mature cow's milk cheeses. For a Cheddar style, keep an eye out for Bravo Farms Silver Mountain from California or Cabot Vintage Reserve from Vermont. The Silver Mountain is something of a hybrid recipe, incorporating procedures from both Cheddar and Cantal. Matured for about nine months, it develops appetizing brown-butter smells and admirable depth of flavor. The Cabot Vintage Reserve is a waxed rindless cheddar given about two years of age. It is creamy, mellow, moist and mild, with a balanced flavor and no acid bite. It lacks the complexity of traditional English farmhouse Cheddar, but it's less than half the price.

Where the girls aren't: For the second year in a row, the Association of Surfing Professionals has failed to have a top-tier women's surfing contest in Hawaii. The men's tour ends in December with the Pipeline Masters, capping the Triple Crown of Surfing events. With surfwear companies that usually sponsor the events hurting financially, the women's event disappeared from the schedule last year and didn't make a comeback this year, despite reports of an economic recovery. It's all the more a shame because the defending Women's World Tour champion is Carissa Moore, from – you guessed it – Oahu.
ANSWER: Last year, out of the blue, the governor's office called and asked if I'd be interested in doing the state ornament.

This year when his office called, they wanted me to work with a school in Joplin in light of the tornado. They asked if I would mind commuting to Joplin to design the ornament and have it replicated. I said it would be an honor. It was so heartwarming to work with those kids.

It is a clash of visions about the role of the federal government and the work of Congress that will go a long way toward defining the Republican Party. For decades, some of the most conservative Republicans steered federal dollars to their home districts as a boon for local economies.

Most would say that it involves space, or a focus on technology, or aliens. There may be a little bit of all of these things. Fantasy is a little bit easier to sum up. The word is 'magic' of course. What if we have aliens, space, intergalactic battles, crazy technology? That's science-fiction. Now take all of those clearly sci-fi elements and add magic. What do we have now? In terms of a genre I don't know, but if you are looking for a title, I can answer "Saga."

Though we weren't rich and lived among an adverse sector of low-income families, I was usually fortunate enough to have cool enough clothes (thanks to my Oma) and a sharp tongue to keep bullying astray from myself. As with most bullies, mean-spirited words and abuse to others less fortunate than me seemed to mask all the shortcomings of my own dysfunctional home life. I was adamant about setting a precedent with fighting and verbal abuse to others in hopes of warding off being the victim of bullying myself.

If you have not yet planned your summer, do so now. You don't want to miss out on opportunities because you procrastinated. Many programs also have deadlines that are approaching, so do your research now. Don't feel pressure to attend a summer program, especially one that you have to pay for if it is not in your family's budget or if the program does not really speak to you. The quality of your experience is what colleges are looking for. They want to know what you pursue in your free time. Simply putting a program down as a line item on your application tends to have little impact.

In order to support the assertion that "the present crisis of East-West relations … has really very little to do with religion and everything to do with political and cultural frictions," Fuller embarks on a narrative tour that ranges from pre-Muslim antiquity to the present-day steppes of Central Asia and the Uyghur hinterlands of far-western China. He delves deeply into the fractious relations between Latin Catholicism and the Eastern Orthodox Church, acrimonious fissures that began in the centuries after the death of Christ and only deepened over time. In fact, even the Crusades, which are routinely portrayed as the purest form of religious conflict between Islam and Christianity, had a dramatic element of conflict between the Eastern Orthodox armies of Constantinople and the hodgepodge of Western knights who invaded on the pretext of liberating the Holy Land.
