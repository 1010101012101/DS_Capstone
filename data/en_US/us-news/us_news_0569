The text also features all manner of charming oddities, such as use of the letter "e" at the end of words (the New Testament is the Newe Testament.)

Moderation – the inhibition of emotional impulses – can take the form of empathy and embarrassment and is critical in helping us negotiate complex social environments.

But neither an asteroid strike nor an upwelling of oxygen-deprived deep-ocean water would explain the selective pattern of death. Instead, the scientists suspect that the answer lies in the biggest volcanic event of the past 500 million years -- the eruptions that formed the Siberian Traps, the stairlike hilly region in northern Russia. The eruptions sent catastrophic amounts of carbon gas into the atmosphere and, ultimately, the oceans; that led to long-term ocean acidification, ocean warming and vast areas of oxygen-poor ocean water.

But the 20-year-old center left college in early January, abandoning NCAA hockey for major junior.
The Red Bulls twice put themselves in position to win a fourth straight game, beginning in the fifth minute. Roy Miller’s throw-in from the left sideline skirted the edge of the penalty area and to the right foot of Henry. The forward corked his body as if preparing to shoot, but instead threaded the ball through the Earthquakes backline to Cooper, held onside just barely by Victor Bernardez.

Old Mazatlán's revival spread from the theater to the stately Pacífico building with its atmospheric corner cafe, and then to buildings all around the plaza, which now house restaurants, museums, shops, galleries and clubs enough to keep a visitor busy for weeks.

Pollock owed his enthusiasm for the visceral impact of monumentality to Mexican muralists Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros and, above all, Orozco. In his first oversize horizontal canvas, a 20-foot-wide 1943 composition, "Mural," commissioned by his patron Peggy Guggenheim (on view at the Des Moines Art Center through July 15), Pollock was influenced not only by Orozco's larger-than-life scale but also by the swirling energy of his brushstrokes and dramatic use of black to define curving contours. Orozco's archetypal images of snakes, skulls and flames, which must have resonated with the American's Jungian sensibility, are abundantly present in Pollock's works at the Hood.

Death rates from unintentional injuries of children from birth to age 19 fell by nearly 30% in the United States from 2000 through 2009, largely because of a 41% drop in deaths in car crashes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. That amounts to more than 11,000 children saved during the decade, Dr. Ileana Arias, principal deputy director of the CDC, said in a news conference. "The rate is among the worst of all high-income countries," she said, and the real shame is that most of the deaths "are predictable and preventable."

The last temple I visited was Tiger's Nest, thousands of feet above the floor of the Paro Valley. Locals say Guru Rinpoche, the first traveler to the cliff-side site, swooped in on a flying tigress in the 8th century, bringing Buddhism with him. We hiked for hours through a forest festooned with prayer flags to reach the monastery that honors Rinpoche's arrival 13 centuries earlier. Tiger's Nest seemed implausibly barnacled to the side of a cliff, but it's crowded with curious travelers and devoted pilgrims who come to pray and be blessed.

"Dark Shadows" — Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are snuggled warmly in their comfort zone in this chilly horror-comedy, their eighth collaboration as director and star, respectively, and their weakest by far. You don't need to know a thing about the "Dark Shadows" TV series that provides the inspiration. Tonally, thematically, visually, you've seen this movie before, with its oddball characters, skies in varying shades of gray and a foreboding sense of gothic mystery. It's actually a wonder that Depp hasn't played a vampire before; still, his long-undead Barnabas Collins, who's been buried alive for nearly two centuries and suddenly finds himself back in his insular Maine hometown in 1972, fits squarely within his well-honed on-screen persona. He thinks he's quite the charmer, but he's actually a bit awkward, and that contradiction provides the main source of humor. Or at least, it's supposed to. The script from Seth Grahame-Smith ("Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter") allows its family full of weirdoes to shine, but too often is crammed with fish-out-of-water gags as Barnabas struggles to make sense of the time in which he's found himself. He struggles to understand modern romance as he courts the family's delicate, wide-eyed nanny (Bella Heathcote) and tries to fit in by smoking pot with the local hippies. Ho ho! "Dark Shadows" feels too languid, and bogged down as it is with an obsessive eye for costumes and period detail rather than offering anything resembling an engaging story. And by the time Burton finally puts his visual effects skills to their best use, in a climactic showdown between Barnabas and the witch who cursed him (Eva Green), it's too late. With Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter and Jackie Earle Haley. PG-13 for comic horror violence, sexual content, some drug use, language and smoking. 116 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.

Most builders, however, recognize the authority of the tall-buildings council, known as the CTBUH. Founded in 1969, it gained prominence in 1996 when deciding whether a pair of Malaysian towers—Kuala Lumpur's Petronas Towers—had eclipsed the Sears Tower as the world's tallest. The council decided the Malaysian towers' spires counted, as they were a deliberate piece of architecture, while the Sears antennas didn't. That made the Petronas Towers the world's highest buildings.

I don't think this story is about me, it should be about the plant. The people there are like no other. They put their heart into that job. Ford is making a terrible mistake."

You'll probably want to drive the mile and a half from downtown to La Posta, and it will be worth the trip. La Posta is an Italian restaurant with such dishes as Dungeness crab ravioli and roasted whole branzino (a European sea bass) with baby fennel and olive relish. It opened in 2006. The space was once a post office, but now it's gone mod, with angled walls. There's a bar up front and a few cool dangling lamps shaded by old Italian postcards. I liked the prosciutto-melon-fig dessert and the easygoing but expert service.

In a region still cleaved by divisions and wedded to nationalist narratives of the war, it's perhaps not surprising that those who extended compassion across ethnic lines have been slow to be recognized, much less honored. This reluctance is not, though, unique to the Balkans. As the historian Jan Gross has noted, Poles who sheltered Jews during World War II were often ostracized decades later by their neighbors. "Their existence was a reproach, calling forth pangs of conscience," Gross has observed. It was far easier for Poles to depict Jews as "crypto-Communists" who had abetted the Soviet occupation of Poland in 1939 and therefore deserved no protection.

We are adjusting, but everything is scary with a preemie. There is so much to figure out, and we get startled at every noise she makes. Apparently preemies grunt a lot, so it was hard getting used to all of her sounds without being afraid of them. We didn't sleep a wink the first night. But now I know that not every grunt means she's suffocating. We also have a home health care professional who comes to the house. One of the NICU nurses even baby-sat for us so we could go to my brother's wedding the weekend after we got home. We are able to call the NICU nurses all of the time if we have questions, and they are so helpful.

Not a cause, not even a curiosity: Just another dead young black man. Nothing to see here. Please, move on.

City officials say they don't have the resources to manage a march that starts in the heart of the Loop during the NATO summit because of the traffic and crowd concerns associated with accommodating the dozens of motorcades that could be moving from downtown hotels to the McCormick Place convention center.

"We battled back in the third," said LW Brayden Schenn, who scored a goal Thursday. "We had a couple chances in overtime on the power play, and we weren't able to capitalize. That's pretty hard. We didn't come out with the start we wanted to, but we battled back and I think we gotta start winning some more battles and compete a little harder.

Resnick is a petite dynamo of cultivated, politically correct superiority, bossiness and self-absorption. Parsons is an ever-evolving revelation in the comic resources of her elastic features, flexible long and lean physique and surprising, even frightening, vocal range.

This time, the need is urgent. Michigan remains mired in a decade-long recession and is still reeling from the loss of a huge portion of its signature auto industry. The state needs jobs, it needs new industry, it needs to fight decay. Michigan has a critical mass of brainpower, engineering know-how and entrepreneurial spirit bred from the success of the auto century in which the state was the world leader.

Another issue: Pension systems depend on contributions from current employees and employers to support benefits. If employers don't make contributions on part of their payroll, it undermines the economics. Recognizing that, some states require contributions on double dippers' salaries, without adding to their benefits. Oregon doesn't, and PERS officials insist the impact of 4.2 million payroll hours by double dippers in 2011 is inconsequential given the size of the active payroll.
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Actor George Lindsey was remembered Friday as the grinning Goober who made television viewers laugh for three decades on "The Andy Griffith Show" and "Hee Haw."
The spillway's opening diverted water from heavily populated New Orleans and Baton Rouge -- along with chemical plants and oil refineries along the Mississippi's lower reaches -- easing pressure on the levees there in the hope of avoiding potentially catastrophic floods.

The Creve Coeur-based biotechnology and agriculture giant has been working over the past three years to buff its image. In 2009, it launched the national "America's Farmers Grow America" campaign, which underscores its connection to farmers, and last year it launched "America's Farmers Grow Communities," which gave $4 million in grants to community organizations this year. The company launched its regional St. Louis Grown effort earlier this summer, placing billboards around the area and ads on the radio and TV. Grant underscored Tuesday that Monsanto gave $9 million to area organizations last year, and that its employees devoted 10,000 hours of public service time.
Born in Urbana, Ill., in 1942, Ebert fairly glows about his dad, an electrician at the University of Illinois. Not so much about his mom. Annabel Ebert wanted him to be a priest, convinced him that sex before marriage was a mortal sin, and warned him above all to avoid a career in journalism. She thought reporters were underpaid and drank too much.

While Barilli’s definition of human trafficking is vastly broader than the one accepted by U.S. officials, his finer point is more subtle. Whenever illegal immigrants take out huge loans to pay smugglers and traffickers for the increasingly difficult illegal passage to the U.S., they are ripe for abuse from the moment they leave home.

SUNDAY’S GAME: at San Francisco 49ers, Candlestick Park, NFC Championship Game, 6:30 p.m., Fox
A chilly Friday night was falling on the ticketholder’s line -- one that stretched the length of the Prudential Center. In the Newark twilight, the Monsters were out. Men and women, most young (but not all) in garish makeup, hair extensions and neon-colored wigs, clunky footwear, patterned gowns with oversized shoulder-pads, had all queued up to hear their hero sing. Many of these fans had seen the Monster Ball many times, and were engaged in a game of one-upsmanship with their fellow monsters. They all knew the rule: when Lady Gaga is in town, raid your closet for the most outlandish thing you can find, and wear it proudly.
"Kendall went from high energy, athletic, and strong to bedridden and unable to literally roll over or sit up on her own within a period of a few weeks," said Erin Prince, Kendall's mother. "She was in extreme pain, lost 15-20 pounds, was losing hair and turning jaundice."

SLU officials have not said what would be done with the existing law school building.
White asked for more time to prepare for the 1997 trial. Judge Arnold’s refusal was the court’s error, Pursel said. “However, taking it one step further, it was ineffective assistance of counsel not to have filed an interlocutory appeal on the very realistic basis set forth by attorney White,” Pursel wrote.

What Ohio House fire-breathers won't say (maybe because they don't know) is that Ohio didn't even require all 88 counties to register voters until 1977. That's when the General Assembly, over GOP objections, passed an election bill sponsored by then-Sen. Tony Hall, a Dayton Democrat later in Congress.
All this comes as the Magic will play in New Jersey today, bringing in Dwight Howard. It's no secret that the Nets have visions of Williams and Howard playing together for them when they move to Brooklyn next season.
Bird was the late-bloomer of his time as an interview subject.

we have policy differences with Smith on key transportation issues, including the need for a new Columbia River Crossing, which he opposes. Moreover, on the stump and an interviews, Smith often seems more activist than executive, and his it's-as-easy-as-that diagnosis of complex city issues reminds us of a certain smart and overconfident neighborhood association leader who joined the Portland City Council almost 20 years ago now: Charlie Hales.

“Mele Kalikimaka,” by Bing Crosby: It’s a silly little Christmas ditty from 1950 featuring the Andrews Sisters. But it feels more appropriate than “Der Bingle’s” other standard, “White Christmas,” when decorating the tree on a sunny Southern California December day.
Here, coach Vin Lananna has rebuilt the Oregon program into a powerhouse. The Nike campus near Beaverton is home to one of the most successful post-collegiate distance programs in the country.

"I couldn't speak for the entire group, because each person acted on their own," she said. "It certainly grieves me that I felt it necessary to make the decision to resign when I've worked very hard for that organization, but I had to make that decision.

There are so many noble ones. But I can't think of kids more in need of some holiday cheer than the ones staying at the Harbor House's emergency shelter for abused women and children.

Sprinkling sugar through cut-out shapes is an easy way to add a touch of drama to cookies. You can purchase precut ones from any craft or art supply store. Or you can make your own with a pair of scissors, a paper plate or thin cardboard, and a couple of minutes. Choose a simple, bold shape. At this time of the year, hearts are a natural, but don't forget spirals, leaves, flowers, initials, or even a minimalist band of color offset across your cookie. For a complementary reverse-color effect, tape the cut-out shape to a skewer and sprinkle sugar carefully around it.
I asked if we could go through the exhibits after the trial concludes, likely in mid-June. He said he'd look into it.
Andrea Adelson, ESPN.com: "Losing Syracuse, Pitt, TCU and West Virginia painted the Big East into this corner. We could play Sunday Morning Quarterback about whether perceived passiveness or ineptitude got the Big East here. Bottom line: Adding Temple had to be done. Therefore the story today should be the second chance that has been afforded Temple -- much in the same way TCU got its second chance in the Big 12. Like the Owls, TCU was the bottom feeder of the Southwest Conference for years before getting kicked to the curb in 1994. There was little need for yet another Texas school, especially one that had made a habit of winning only a handful of games a season. TCU worked its way back up, making it to multiple BCS games and securing an invite to the Big East before its true love, the Big 12, came calling last year. Temple has yet to achieve the same success as TCU. For all its improvements, Temple is still in its infancy as a winning program, and never once played for the MAC title -- despite being favored to win its division in 2010."
"There are a number of good teams in this division that significantly improved over the winter," said Antonetti.

He then ordered Howard to serve consecutive 17-year sentences.

From cargo hub tax credits to a new fund for high-tech startups, Nixon echoed many of the priorities laid out by House and Senate leaders in tax credit legislation they unveiled Wednesday.

Excerpt: Lavasier Tuinei and Josh Huff have a lot of talent and should be improved over last season, David Paulson is a star, and there's enough talent behind them to expect adequate production from the receivers and tight ends in 2011, if not better. Position coach Scott Frost got the most out of Jeff Maehl and Drew Davis, which bodes well for the next generation, and the potential for Kenjon Barner to enhance the passing game is promising, too. But all of that is theoretical at the moment. It's up to the veteran backups and highly touted newcomers to prove this month that they're ready to make an impact.

Gina is running because she can't go to the authorities for help. She's definitely no innocent victim (she packs a Glock), and her situation is anything but typical. Gina entered witness protection after helping put her mobster husband — and the father of her son — in prison. Before joining the WitSec program, she also helped herself to a substantial amount of her husband's ill-gotten gains. Needless to say, her father-in-law is quite anxious to both eliminate Gina and reclaim his grandson, and the U.S. marshal assigned to her case wants the bounty the father-in-law is offering as well as the loot she absconded with.

Upstairs, the two buildings are connected; the owners tore down a connecting wall. But on Thursday night, that new space was darkened. It was around 10:45 p.m. and a weekly comedy show had just ended, with a few of the comics hanging around to talk to fans and friends. Even though there weren't enough people to justify opening up the new space, it was a missed opportunity to show off the new digs.

Last year's "Will the Guns Come Out" was a reckless garage-punk explosion with plenty of yelling and trashy guitar. It also featured elements of real soul, though, including a vocal build that sounds exactly like the Isley Brothers' "Twist and Shout" at the end of a swaggering soul-punk track called "Build. Destroy. Rebuild." And speaking of swaggering soul, Black Carl definitely takes this from a show you have to see to a show you can't afford to miss.

Jesse Carmichael does not play on "Payphone," and it’s unclear whether he’s had anything to do with "Overexposed." His seat in the band is being kept warm by PJ Morton, an excellent New Orleans pianist who had already been touring as an adjunct member of Maroon 5. Morton may have contributed the generic Bruno Mars-style piano arpeggios on "Payphone," or they may have been played by any of a thousand Los Angeles studio musicians. Producers Shellback and Benny Blanco attempted to preserve a few characteristics of the former Maroon 5 sound on "Jagger": James Valentine’s scratchy funk guitar and Mickey Madden’s rubbery Bee Gees bass. On "Payphone," those are gone, replaced by a clueless guest verse by Pittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa, who interrupts Levine’s tale of heartbreak to brag about how all of his cars start with a push of a button. It is not hard to understand why Carmichael decided that feeling people’s heads was more interesting than making music like this.
