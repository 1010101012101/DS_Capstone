But not as widely as the wound left when Wade lost control of his wind-buffeted car 13 years ago, which "flipped, and flipped, until all of the life of the boy was pressed from him. And from me." In the months afterward the couple turned to each other for support and solace, stumbled through the darkness together and emerged into something of a permanent half-light, always in the shadow of the dead child.
"Obviously if you go to Cleveland, Joe Thomas is the left tackle, so probably right now a little more right tackle. Honestly, I'm pretty comfortable with both, like you said I've played both in my career, so I'm comfortable doing either. I know Cleveland has probably the best left tackle in the game, so I understand my role in regards to that."
Del Borrello had a larger expectation of savings of anywhere from $700,000 to $1 million, but Smith was more conservative, saying that his estimate of saving slightly less than $550,000 also included savings from premiums for library employees, who are not a part of the municipal budget.

Reading your recent collection of letters on climate change ("Room for debate," Oct. 29), I wonder how useful such debates are. A businessman writes about the science behind climate change, and readers with no background in science respond. Is there anything to be learned from these amateurish exchanges?
"It's like the Craigslist thing," said Ross, founder and president of the Woodlawn Community Education and Development Association.
But nothing like that went down on Friday night. Instead, Nugent loaded his hour-and-a-half set with a barrage of riff-heavy tunes, pulling most from his multi-platinum early records.

"I didn't speak to her or see her for six years. I didn't want to hear any explanations, although I would have liked to know why she couldn't have been honest with me. When we finally did run in to each other, she apologized. By that time, I'd pretty much cooled off, so I didn't feel like heaping more grief on her. I'm not really a guy to carry a grudge. Once I let a painful thing go, it's out of my life. However, I must admit, that first time I saw her after all those years, I couldn't take my eyes off her. She still stunned me. That took a while to get over."

"Renovation" might be an overly modest term, however. Flynn and Nelson demolished the original gabled upper story and replaced it with a full second floor. They put on an addition that took the house from 1,676 to 3,006 square feet. They also moved the front door several feet to create a direct path to the kitchen and replaced the original door with a window to bring in more light.

”There's a lot of pressure on moms and dads because of the burden of a disabled child. Look, it is a hardship. A lot of these children require a tremendous amount of care, and I can understand the pain and hardship, but I can tell you as someone who has gone through it, Bella is a great -- we have seven children and they are all a tremendous, great gift.

Today, a few options for day-excursion cruising remain. Most major cities on the Great Lakes have some type of cruise ships, including the Goodtime III in Cleveland.
Holland, shooting in confined spaces with little light, elicits taut performances from a strong cast. The filmmaker, whose career took off with a very different sort of Holocaust film, 1990's Oscar-nominated "Europa Europa," understands that most of these stories arrive at a point of unspeakable, incomprehensible horror. These moments force us to ask questions about ourselves, our existence, about the nature of man and the nature of God  or if there is a God at all.
But Benson will turn 30, the dread age for runners, by the end of the season. He has averaged 298.3 attempts over the past three seasons as a workhorse in Cincinnati. And in the last two seasons, Benson's average is just 3.7 yards per carry.

The characters in "American Reunion" might have evolved from "American Pie," but the humor hasn't. It's still of the immature sex-and-bathroom variety. As for the characters evolving, who cares? You saw how I glossed over most of them in the last paragraph, I guarantee most viewers gloss over them in the same way. Plus the film tries to cram even more familiar faces on screen as if the audience is going through a checklist. OK, I was, but the majority of the audience won't be.
Gordon probably knows better than most that it won't be easy. The district has less money, fewer students and more challenges, thanks to a flimsy state government safety net for poor families.
A few possible reasons come to mind. One is that engagement with a regime that so suffocates its nation may strengthen the regime. Western Europe has been engaging with Cuba for decades; the Castros pocket the euros at no apparent cost to the stability of their dictatorship.

But if there are three minutes of chuckles, the rest is 90 minutes of agony. This has to be one of the worst scripts of this century (penned by the Farrellys with Mike Cerrone). Ostensibly, the three guys grow up at an orphanage and when the place faces foreclosure, they set out to make a bundle of money to try to save it. Along the way, they are recruited by a scheming woman (Sofia Vergara from "Modern Family") who wants to hire the lads to off her husband.

Passing by their big windows, I used to marvel at people who were inside shopping for chocolate in the middle of the day in the middle of the week in the middle of the year, merely because they could. I was too young and naive then to understand how exceptional chocolate, when given as an unexpected gift, could sometimes wield great power ... not unlike a Jedi mind trick.
The torrent has rolled merrily on, unimpeded by the ample evidence that America remains a center-right country: The number of people calling themselves conservative has increased and the number of those calling themselves liberal has not. And disapproval of Obama flows directly from traditional conservative anxieties about government spending, taxing and meddling. Furthermore, few Republicans drench other Republicans with as much vitriol as many Democratic liberals pour on Sen. Joe Lieberman and other centrists.
They found their first collectable tractor, a green 1955 John Deere, parked at a farm near the East Texas town of Winnsboro.

Earlier Wednesday, the CBO also reported that Reid's bill included a smaller cut in the federal deficit than Democrats had advertised. The nonpartisan budget analysts said the Senate proposal to lift the legal limit on the national debt would slice $2.2 trillion from the federal deficit over the next decade, short of its $2.7 trillion target, but far more than the cuts in Boehner's plan.

I don't try to stand out. I wear what's comfortable, even though it might not be the same stuff that other people are wearing. Freshman year, I did feel like I had to have every trendy item. Miami is preppy, and designer labels are really important. Once I realized that no one really cares, I went back to having my own unique style.
Brandon Beck had been a starting varsity football player at Chandler High School and a star baseball pitcher for his club team. His mom, a former Tempe police officer, and his stepdad, a current Phoenix police officer, doted on him.

Kat Green worried that would be her son's fate, too. Waiting for more ambulances, she kept holding onto her son on the lawn. His cheeks were bloody with scratches from clawing at his own face. Colton tried to sit up, then fell over and seized, his muscles tensed so tight that Green thought his body would somehow break. She watched his lips turn blue.

Come equipped: Bring a flashlight, a ruler and a team of curious, creative friends. Ability to hustle helps. A compass may also be an advisable tool for those with a lackluster sense of direction.

In Old Pasadena, scads of national chains occupy the historic facades along Colorado Boulevard, and sidewalks are filled with pedestrians day and night. To find homegrown merchants and eateries, check the old brick alleys and side streets or sign onto a Melting Pot Food Tour (www.meltingpottours.com).

Colorado Blvd.), which dates to the 1890s, will sell you "Hometown Pasadena" (an excellent guidebook) or just about any other book. The nearby Pasadena Playhouse (revived by bankruptcy reorganization in 2010) stands in an atmospheric 1920s building at 39 S.

Few expect two superstars -- with similarly supersized egos -- to simply fall in line behind Lin and morph from the main attraction into a supporting cast. Anthony and Stoudemire will take the ball out of Lin's hands when they return, forcing the point guard to be more a distributor and less of a scorer. But with his ability to get to the rim, Lin has shown he's more of a scorer than the last point guard to succeed in D'Antoni's uptempo offense -- perennial All-Star Steve Nash.
Hey, Tony: Mike Holmgren has been a total disappointment so far.

Mels learns to dance, gets a cool new wardrobe and hairdo, buys a saxophone, changes his name to plain old Mel and starts hanging out at the Pompadour Club with Polly and her fellow hipsters. It’s only a matter of time before he beds Polly.

Also, as with "WillFul," it initially was conceived as a play about the history of a place, but became a story about the experiences of the people who spend time there. Vancouver School of Arts and Academics was founded in 1996 -- before some of the students who helped write "Thresholds" were born. History quickly was pushed out by more immediate concerns.
One big difference between Clemens and Bonds -- other than Bonds claiming he unwittingly used steroids -- is that Bonds' personal trainer refused to testify.

You'll all feel more deeply connected and even happier to be together.

They told him he was there to answer questions about accusations that he raped a woman during the previous month. And for about a half hour, Sowell, in a baritone voice, explained that the sex was consensual and that he indulged the woman’s kinky preferences.

The Wall Street Journal online edition covers why China struggles with food safety ... the short answer being, food companies’ attitude of profit at any cost. Contamination cases brought to light over the last few months are truly horrifying, including noodle makers mixing ink and wax into dough, and this: “in Changsha, a number of consumers earlier this month walked into their kitchens at night to discover their store-bought pork was glowing in the dark.” Education (or lack thereof) is part of the problem, but another issue, according to the story, “is that there are too many cooks in the kitchen — or rather too many bureaucracies handling food safety.”

Start by piling into the back of an open-sided Pinzgauer all-wheel-drive touring vehicle and bouncing through what seems like every one of the island’s climate zones from rain forest to alpine peak in the short 45-minute drive up the side of the mountain Hualalai volcano. While we assign prosaic names to these areas, the guide explains that the Hawaiians referred to them as “the realm of the gods,” “the realm of the forests” and “the realm of man.”
Many lawmakers in both chambers still see ending Saturday delivery as an important, timely and necessary cost-cutting move.

You can see it in the retro style of modern spookshows like “House of the Devil,” “The Ward,” the upcoming “11-11-11” or the recent “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark” (itself a remake of a 1973 TV movie), films that tend to prefer slowly darkening moods to violent shock cuts.

First off, I have to give Laine credit for dancing, prancing and stomping around in stilettos without hitting the deck. I don't know how you girls do it. But balancing acts aside, Laine is a southern-fried firework show. Even with running around to a fast-paced song, Laine kept herself on pitch and on time with the rhythm, an impressive feat for a teen. She definitely has that star quality -- I can already see her in a flannel shirt and cowboy hat with a full band behind her, singing to a bunch of other people in flannels and cowboy hats. Strong performance.
Many of the largest area municipalities also saw decreases in property crimes: larceny, burglary, auto theft and arson. A few of the area's bigger cities, including St. Charles and Maryland Heights, saw slight increases in either violent and property crime or both.
At $15 billion a year, the cash Apple will pay out in dividends and stock buybacks starting later in 2012 won't even come close to trimming the $98 billion hoard on its balance sheet.
"If we're going to see the game played like it is, we're going to need better technology. We need to protect heads. Is it possible to do that? Is it possible for someone to come up with a helmet that stops the brain from being jolted?

The difference between leather helmets and what we have now, that's basically what we need going forward."

The lawyer for the Animal Protection League of New Jersey and the Bear Education and Resource, or BEAR, group had argued that the DEP's methodology for tallying the bear population and the numbers of complaints was skewed toward holding a hunt. The court found that the DEP's uses met an acceptable legal standard, however.
"It's the perfect job for a criminal," said Don Rees, a Multnomah County senior deputy district attorney. "Instead of trying to isolate a victim or breaking into someone's house, they can just put on a suit, politely knock on the door and then attack their victim. After they've committed their crime, they can get into a van with other salespeople, and be in a different state a short time later. They can commit more crimes and move to the next city."
McIntosh, whose dialogue consists mostly of screams and grunts, gets a lot across with her eyes -- fear, anger, empathy. And Bridgers balances the humor in the script with Chris' true nature nicely. What a creep. Bettis and Carter are also good at expressing the pain their characters feel. But scariest of all is Rand, who reveals Brian's pocket-sized sadism with a relish that's more disturbing than the gore.

How to feed your teens
Governors can only work with the applicant pools they are given. If not enough qualified African American, Latino, Asian and other non-white lawyers are applying to become judges, the best a governor can do is encourage more to try. But even that requires a diverse population of attorneys, which in turn requires a population of law students, college and university students and ultimately high school graduates that reflects the state's people.
Local connections: Canton native John Bickar, 34, is fifth in men's 10-meter air pistol, 5.5 points out of second place. Abagail Stanec, 20, of Wadsworth, is sixth in women's 10-meter air rifle but withdrew to compete this weekend for her college team, Mississippi, in a conference championship.

I've been playing around with the Windows 8 preview for several weeks.

We checked into the Plakures, a compound of whitewashed condos, neatly trimmed in Tiffany blue. Each room comes with a wrought-iron bed, a marble floor, functional Ikea-style furniture and a small, well-equipped kitchenette. Though the area is dry, the hotel property is lush. Gravel pathways that connect the rooms to the pool and restaurant are lined with palm, fig and pomegranate trees. The hotel is Greece just as you imagine it — if you were German.
But tracking that cash—and determining whether schools have gotten their money's worth—remains daunting. The federal government does not tally how private educational consultants have benefited from the turnaround windfall, nor do most states, according to an analysis published by The Denver Post in February. In about 15 states that agreed to tally such spending, an average of roughly 25 percent of all SIG money went to private consultants.
Last September, members of a group that searches for vintage aircraft were scouring the countryside for the plane that collided with Moritz's aircraft when they happened upon Moritz's remains and what little was left of his P-51.

That's it. Well, you do need to hang it, too (otherwise why put them in a basket?), in a spot where they'll be happy (and, if not actually giddy, at least not pessimistic, Dennis points out) and water them as needed. Keep in mind that baskets tend to dry out faster than pots. In fact, I've hooked ours up to our drip system so that the water is something I don't have to think twice (or once) about.

He pleaded guilty to several bribery-related crimes. That same week, Kelley, Gallagher and former halfway house administrator Brian Schuman also pleaded guilty to charges, making them the first four defendants to admit to crimes involving corruption in county government in connection with the ongoing investigation.
The bad news: A British tabloid apparently proved what some have long suspected, that Pakistan's cricketers are up to their eyeballs in the murk of illegal betting. News of the World (owned by the parent company of this newspaper) sent undercover reporters, posing as front men for a "Far East gambling cartel," to meet a fixer who claimed that seven Pakistani players were on the take. The reporters set up a sting operation in which they paid £150,000 ($232,000) for two of the country's leading bowlers to throw no-balls (a kind of foul ball). Screaming headlines and dimly lit undercover video completed the disgrace.
Update: This is a good matchup for Chivas USA, which is not only unbeaten on the road this season but, in Toronto FC, will play the only MLS team still looking for its first point in the standings. Chivas remains without striker Juan Pablo Angel (concussion) and midfielder Michael Lahoud (hamstring), neither of whom traveled to Toronto, according to a team official. However, Chivas does have midfielder Paolo Cardozo, acquired in a trade with the L.A. Galaxy on Tuesday. In last week's match at Portland, Chivas midfielder Ryan Smith came off the bench in the second half to assist on both goals in a 2-1 win. Meanwhile keeper Dan Kennedy has allowed only four goals in five games.

Then she tried to tell herself the cop was only sleeping.
Arlington Woods is in the second year of Project Restore, and nothing has played a more significant role in the remarkable improvement here than the weekly testing program. It's centered on a belief that too few students at low-income schools receive the type of academic rigor found in more successful districts, and on the idea that students at struggling schools deserve to be challenged with high expectations. It's also based on the concept that having data -- quick and telling data -- makes teachers more effective.
The challenge for CPS is not only informing parents about the program but also making sure students who qualify are enrolled and attend regularly, officials said.

On a brighter note, the Heck’s house salad (gratis with entrees; $10.50, full size; $5.50, half size) was a solid hit. Sparkling fresh, the delicate mix of mesclun, sturdy iceberg chunks, blue cheese, walnuts and tart dried cherries was a lyric play of textures and tastes. Similarly, the bruschetta salad ($10.50) showed off a sure “veggie” hand in the kitchen, with asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes, a toss of olives and a goat cheese even goat-cheese-ophobes could relish.

While TSA cannot comment further on an ongoing regulatory investigation, we can assure travelers the decision to allow the plane to continue was sound based on a comprehensive security risk assessment."
Yet even this may not be enough to save the architectural and religious landmark, long known for its lavish spending and now caught short by plummeting revenue. Crystal Cathedral Ministries recently filed a reorganization plan that calls for selling its 40-acre campus to a real estate developer and leasing back its core for $212,000 a month. In October, the church said it owed creditors more than $50 million.

Many salient facts about the tracking of terrorism's most prolific killer to his lair -- some lair: not a remote cave but an urban compound -- must remain shrouded in secrecy, for now.

While bin Laden remained the titular head and spiritual leader of al Qaeda, many in the counter-terrorism community believed he was no longer running al Qaeda’s day-to-day operations. Some, in fact, believed he might even be dead, especially since Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan’s president, claimed in 2002 that bin Laden was suffering from kidney failure and required regular dialysis treatment.

Nick Jonjevic, 31, has the chops for an ambitious culinary career. He spent the past year updating Powell Gardens� catering and restaurant operations, but his kitchen was largely hidden from view. Recently, he was lured away by Marshall Roth, executive chef of the McClain Group, which owns several destination restaurants on the historic Independence Square. Ending one job on a Sunday, he took the reins as executive chef of Ophelia�s the next day. Jonjevic, who grew up on a family farm in Michigan before graduating from the Culinary Institute of America, describes his cooking style as �French meets Midwest comfort food.� But the results can be surprising and unexpected. For instance, at a spring theater benefit he served a broccoli terrine in aspic, a classic dish popular before the turn of the last century and a luxury so laborious to make that it was reserved for honored guests. At least until instant Jell-O came along.
However, as Einstein is famously said to have quipped, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. For more than 40 years, we have been following the strategy of attempting to control the supply of drugs by interdiction. At best, the strategy has had mixed results and many make a compelling argument that it has been a disaster. A doctor who has worked with drug abusers for more than 40 years told me last week that the war on drugs was one of our generation's greatest moral failures because it had not substantially reduced addiction while doing incalculable collateral damage to young people. And, of course, it has been astronomically expensive.

Yet that didn't stop 5th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Smith and two fellow Republican appointees on the bench from demanding theU.S. Justice Department produce a 3-page, single-spaced memo affirming the court's right to review legislation for its constitutionality. If it was an attempt to embarrass the administration, it backfired as it simply made Judge Smith appear thin-skinned, self-aggrandizing, petulant, and, frankly, partisan.

Steiner illustrates the trend in O.C. judicial elections: A mid-career deputy D.A. identifies a judge who is retiring, secures his or her endorsement, publicly stakes out the seat and then sets about fundraising. Any non-prosecutor thinking about challenging not only has to overcome the deputy D.A.'s solid-gold ballot title but the sheer momentum. Few have the resources or inclination, and thus the civil and criminal-defense bars generally must rely on a gubernatorial appointment to get their ilk into the black robe.
CAMDEN — A Westville woman admitted Wednesday she pushed her boyfriend from a RiverLine train platform as the train was approaching, Camden County Prosecutor Warren W. Faulk said.

An impressive new study followed 19,000 Harvard students for decades. Those who entered college with elevated blood pressure were much more likely to have fatal cardiovascular problems later in life: They had a 14 percent increased risk of death from coronary heart disease and an 8 percent higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. Imagine if that were your college kid.
A record such as Buffy's was tough to achieve in the Northeast, where the palomino population is far smaller than in the South, West and Midwest, and there are less shows as result. Economics play a role in how Buffy is campaigned. The Camerons didn't go to Oklahoma to pick up their awards in person because of the cost; they're saving to compete later this year in the palomino world championship show, which also is in Oklahoma.
“It motivates me, very much so,” Alvarez said of Mosley's record against his countrymen. “I hear it from fans I run into and on Twitter: ‘Please, put a stop to him.’
Otherwise, I head for the condo hotels nearest to Poipu Beach. Kauai is making great noise this year about Hanalei Bay, on the north side of the island, being named Best Beach in the U.S. by a Florida oceanography professor who goes by the name of Dr. Beach. The secret is Hanalei isn't even the top beach on Kauai, according to Dr. Beach. The professor gives this annual award and then bars the winning sand strand from a repeat appearance in the contest. Poipu Beach won in 2001 — seven beaches (including one in North Carolina) before Hanalei Bay.

A: The problem is that the decline in the housing market dwarfs this agreement. The total decline of the housing market has been in the trillions, and negative equity in housing, by one estimate, was about $700 billion. So this is too small to be very effective.

What "Leap of Faith" lacks are sweat and heart, the absence of which will be bothersome only if you permit yourself to imagine how this well-oiled applause machine might have run had its creators taken the plot seriously. Real emotions, raw and hurtful, are at stake in "Leap of Faith," and on occasion they bob to the surface, as in the scene in which a frumpy, desperately unhappy woman (well played by Dierdre Friel) drops her wedding ring in the collection basket. Adam Guettel or Michael John LaChiusa would have made the whole show as gripping as that one short scene. Not so the makers of "Leap of Faith," who are, like Mr. Esparza, content to skate glamorously atop the surface of their characters' feelings. If that's good enough for you, then you won't be sorry you came.

Overall, the state has $86.7 billion in pension fund assets, but has pledged $128.5 billion in benefits, the report shows.

Howard Troxler: If Crist runs as an independent he's really going to have to invent a new kind of politics and he's going to have to appeal to the "reasonable middle" and to Democrats aggressively. If he runs as Republican-Lite, he loses. He can't passively count on support from the teacher veto or anything else. If he stays in the party he'll hit Rubio as hard as he can and hope for a miracle — then he needs to turn around and support Rubio if he loses, play the loyal Republican solider and look for another Senate or House run down the road. He's only 53.

Often, sellers will push back on the price after an inspection turns up needed repairs.

At home in her bright 'n' cute kitchen -- hexenbiests have good taste in kitchen decor, apparently -- Adalind combines Hank's blood with hers, stirring it all up in a yecchhy looking batter. She shows up on Hank's doorstep, greeting him with a basket of her special home-baked chocolate chip cookies. Hank seems dubious, but takes a bite. "They're incredible," he says, feeling a little more flirty. As Adalind sashays off into the night, she warns him not to share the cookies with anyone else, because she made them just for him. Hank stands there, watching, and chewing. We see his breath, which means either they shot this on a cold Portland night, or the cookies make Hank so hot to trot he's giving off steam.

Well, that is stretching the definition way past the breaking point. Words mean things, and people who use them should respect that. A refusal infers a request and a consequent rejection. Neither happened. What we had here was a judgment, independent of the bishop or his office. Totally different thing.
The bread is as much about timing as anything. You want it coming off the grill (yes, grill) when the tri-tip does. The bread will be on the grill maybe five minutes. This means that after two hours of leisurely 'cuing the tri-tip, the whole thing comes to a furious, madcap crescendo of activity at the very end. This is where having nerves of steel and the orchestration skills of a conductor are vital. My ex-brother-in-law Jerry, bad as he was on the beans, is the best bread guy I've ever known.

The products: Lowly fungi have an amazing ability to create compounds that have strong effects on humans (alcohol, hallucinogens and antibiotics, to name a few). As far back as the Tang dynasty in 800, the Chinese harvested a red extract produced by certain types of fungi growing on rice.

After the game Yost said they're monitoring the players closely for any sign of giving up or getting comfortable with losing. Eric Hosmer came to the plate in the 6th inning after hitting an opposite field home run in his first at-bat. Some guys decide to try for a big night and go for another long ball. Hosmer saw third playing back and over toward second in a shift and laid down a bunt instead. Eric slid into first base head first  the throw was wild so he got up, took off for second and slid into that base head first.

The federal government last year vowed to review the country's 300,000 pending immigration court cases and exercise so-called prosecutorial discretion to shift its focus to those cases involving convicted criminals wreaking havoc on local neighborhoods.

Is torture always wrong? We've all heard the scenarios about the necessity of extracting information from terrorists-in-the-know to foil their plots. If it were demonstrably true that torture would be effective in a given case and thus save thousands of lives, it's difficult to say "never." But does it ever really play out like the scenarios on "24," the television show in which the hero can always count on a little torture to extract the intel and save the multitudes?

Gov. Rick Perry isn't bothering to come up with a new way to say "no" to a special legislative session on school funding, as my colleague Gary Scharrer reported on our Texas Politics blog last week. When the Texas Democratic Party urged a session, Perry spokeswoman Allison Castle referred Scharrer to the response she gave when the Texas State Teachers Association made the call 10 days earlier: "There are no plans to call a special session on this or any other issue. Thanks to Gov. Perry's fiscally conservative leadership Texas has a balanced budget and has increased funding to Texas public schools by billions of dollars."

In the first episode of "American Horror Story," Murphy and Falchuk start at the over-the-top-level it took entire seasons to reach on previous series. The setup: Dylan McDermott and Connie Britton are a married couple who move with their teenage daughter to a grand old house in Los Angeles.
