It wasn't immediately clear how many of bin Laden's documents the U.S. was still keeping secret. In a note published with the 175 pages in Arabic that were released Thursday, along with English translations, retired Gen. John Abizaid said they probably represent only a small fraction of materials taken from the compound in the U.S. raid that tracked down and killed bin Laden in May 2011.

The commendations were for statewide, bipartisan prison reforms made over the past decade that have slowed Texas' adult incarceration rate, preventing a potentially budget-busting crisis of overcrowded prisons.

The suit claims that the purchase was a politically motivated bailout of Musick's company, which faced a lawsuit from lenders on the project for defaulting on a loan. Musick and his partners, Adolphus A. Busch IV and Alan Skop, had been sued for $11.6 million by a Birmingham, Ala.-based bank that helped finance the project.
"You have to be realistic," said Busch, who was needed to make just one save as San Jose controlled play most of the night, particularly in the early going. "We're on the road and our philosophy at that point is 'Let's at least get one.' You don't want to throw that road point away.

But while bakers like Boyce want to show the sweet side of rye, some, such as Edgar Loesch of Fressen Artisan Bakery, love its full-blown heft. Loesch grew up in Germany, where the government sets quotas for rye bread composition. He now bakes a variety of breads for Fressen in the same tradition. Loesch laments that because American breads aren't subject to the same regulations, we've come to think of rye bread as "white bread with a bit of speckles in it." Loesch's loaves, baked according to German regional practices, can come across as dense and heavy to palates brought up on softer stuff.

Drew Pomeranz (age 23): The Rockies would be delighted if their young left-hander gave them 170 innings and 10 victories, but he has the stuff to push the learning curve and challenge the pitch count established by the team.

The legislative deal came Wednesday as lawmakers adopted an alternative congressional map offered by Republicans last month, which replaces a map Republicans approved in September that Democrats opposed.

I agree Roger's having an interesting trajectory this season. He seems to be gradually coming to grips with his awareness that he's becoming something of a relic of an earlier generation.

The veteran right-hander has received the worst run support in the majors since 2006, keeping him from being a winning pitcher even as his ERA has hovered just above three.

“The start of the ‘War Between the States’ is being recognized for the 150th year. The U.S. government is still up to its old tricks: Creating laws to protect the states, and not providing the funds to enforce that law. A federal law against a criminal activity that only the feds can enforce, no funds attached, but states have to supply the funds to support the criminals of that law. Illegal immigration, no one wants to discuss it in this upcoming election.”
We don't know what Portland's opponent will look like. But what became apparent with the Blazers victory is that they understand the basic tenets of competition -- that with something at stake, you play hard every night and let the rest take care of itself. You don't lay up on the big stage. You don't throttle down with something left to play for. Not until the standings are final, and the playoff matchups locked up.

As is the case with the majority of chronic muscle-skeleton problems, the most important thing is to identify the causes of your pain instead of trying to mask them with passive treatments (medication, massage, ultrasound) that may provide only temporary relief. For example, common causes for sciatica include muscle weakness (especially in the hips and thighs), inflexibility (especially in the hamstrings and hips), poor coordination of trunk muscles and/or obesity (BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2011). Sciatica can also be caused by less common problems, such as a herniated disk, deep vein thrombosis, endometriosis and cancer (Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine 2011).

Avoid getting bumped. 1) Get an advance seat assignment. Passengers with seat assignments are typically only bumped if they arrive late and their seat assignment is released. 2) Check-in online. Most airlines allow you to do so within 24 hours of departure. Seat assignments that were not available at the time of ticketing may be available when checking in online. 3) Don't be late. If all else fails, get to the airport early. Some airlines reserve a portion of their seat assignment inventory for airport check-in. If you are denied a seat assignment at check-in, put your name on the "standby" seat assignment list.

A: Guilt should not be part of trying to achieve a healthy body weight. All that will do is make you feel bad about yourself. Negative thoughts do not help you achieve anything. Calories are not "evil"; they are beneficial to us. It is our source of energy. We all need enough calories to fuel our brain and body. If we get too little, our body slows down our metabolism to conserve energy for those very important tasks (such as breathing) and it makes weight loss more difficult to achieve. If we get too much, we store it for later use and gain weight.

The participants' words also reinforce the findings of the research on the Morris Dance Center's programs. The one I liked the best is: "When class starts, symptoms seem to slip away. We are not patients, just dancers."

Regarding The Sun's and state Sen. Rob Garagiola's insistence on raising the gas tax, perhaps they do not understand the double tax whammy they are proposing. First, the tax will impact the citizens of Maryland when they purchase gas by increasing the price of a tank of gas at least $1.50.

With all this pi-ety going on, one might assume that Pi (the boy) was born on 3/14. But no, he has a December birthday. And one might also suspect that one or both of little Pi's parents might be a mathematician/scientist/Spock.

We have our little games, but they have complete freedom to do whatever they want if there's no blitzing."
